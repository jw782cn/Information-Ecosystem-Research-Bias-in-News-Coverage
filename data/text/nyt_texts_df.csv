0,"A convoy of five vans snaked slowly on Friday from the battered Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, toward Chernihiv, in the northeast of the country. On board were generators, clothes, fuel — and medications needed to treat H.I.V.With a main bridge decimated by shelling, the drivers crept along back roads, hoping to reach Chernihiv on Saturday and begin distributing the drugs to some of the 3,000 residents in desperate need of treatment.Organizers of efforts like this one are rushing to prevent the war in Ukraine from morphing into a public health disaster. The conflict, they say, threatens to upend decades of progress against infectious diseases throughout the region, sparking new epidemics that will be nearly impossible to control.Ukraine has alarmingly high numbers of people living with H.I.V. and hepatitis C, and dangerously low levels of vaccination against measles, polio and Covid-19. Overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions for refugees are breeding grounds for cholera and other diarrheal diseases, not to mention respiratory plagues like Covid-19, pneumonia and tuberculosis.“If they don’t get the medicines, there is a high risk that they will actually die because of the lack of therapy, if they don’t die under the shelling,” said Dmytro Sherembei, who heads 100% Life, the organization delivering medications to Chernihiv residents with H.I.V.Mr. Sherembei, 45, learned he had H.I.V. 24 years ago. He is one of more than 250,000 people in Ukraine living with the virus, a huge epidemic driven largely by the sharing of contaminated needles among intravenous drug users.Ukraine and the surrounding region also make up a world epicenter of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, a form of the disease impervious to the most powerful medications.The Ukrainian health ministry in recent years had made progress in bringing these epidemics under control, including a 21 percent drop in new H.I.V. infections and a 36 percent decline in TB diagnoses since 2010.But health officials now fear that delays in diagnosis and treatment interruptions during the war may allow these pathogens to flourish again, with consequences that ripple for years.“Last year, we were working to differentiate between different TB mutations,” Iana Terleeva, who heads tuberculosis programs for Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, said in a statement. “Now instead, we are trying to differentiate between aerial shelling, raids and other military hardware.”The fighting also has damaged health facilities throughout the country and spawned a refugee crisis, imperiling thousands of people with chronic conditions like diabetes and cancer who depend on continuing care.“Everything is at very high risk, as it is always in the battlefield,” said Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, a former U.N. secretary general envoy for Eastern Europe.“We should anticipate major health crises with regard to infectious diseases and chronic diseases across the region that I expect to be severe and durable,” he added.ImageDmytro Sherembei, second from left, with volunteers and workers with 100% Life.Credit...100% LifeImageSupplies gathered by 100% Life at the Kyiv Medical Center.Credit...100% LifeImageFamilies evacuated from Chernihiv waited to board a train in Kyiv to leave Ukraine this month. The World Health Organization and other agencies are stockpiling TB drugs for refugees arriving in Poland.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesThe war “will have a huge impact on health systems that are already very fragile,” Dr. Kazatchkine said.More than three million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, most of them to Poland, and nearly seven million are internally displaced. The refugees are arriving in countries unprepared for an onslaught of patients with medical needs, experts said.Moldova, for example, is one of the poorest nations in Europe, ill equipped to care for refugees or to stem infectious disease outbreaks. Countries like Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan buy drugs and vaccines produced by Russia and are heavily dependent on its economy.Russia itself has more people with H.I.V. than any country in Eastern Europe, and Western sanctions are likely to interrupt the already low levels of funding for services in the country.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Within Ukraine, nearly 1,000 health care facilities are close to conflict zones or areas no longer under government control. The World Health Organization has recorded at least 64 attacks on such facilities, including 24 in which the buildings were damaged or destroyed.The hospitals that are still operational struggle to care for the sick and wounded, and are crippled by dwindling medical supplies, including oxygen and insulin, and a shortage of lifesaving equipment like defibrillators and ventilators.Hundreds of children with cancer have fled their homes, according to the World Health Organization. The armed conflict has even derailed routine childhood vaccinations.Only about 80 percent of Ukrainian children were immunized against polio in 2021, and the country had detected a few polio cases even before the war began. The vaccination coverage for measles in Ukraine is likewise too low to prevent outbreaks.ImageAt the Ukrainian Embassy in Berlin, people waited to receive a Covid vaccination.Credit...Filip Singer/EPA, via ShutterstockThese are the ingredients of a public health calamity, many experts fear. The W.H.O. and other organizations are deploying medical teams and shipping supplies, vaccines and drugs to Ukraine and to neighboring countries. But the aid may never reach areas of active conflict.‘It’s very scary’During the pandemic lockdowns, the Ukrainian government began disbursing three-month supplies of medications for H.I.V. and tuberculosis. But many Ukrainians forced to abandon their demolished cities were able to take only limited supplies of the medications needed to keep them alive.Elizaveta Grib, 16, fled her home in Kyiv with her mother and younger brother on Feb. 28, four days after the bombing began. They packed what they could in suitcases and made their way by train to Mykolaiv, a city near the southern port of Odessa that came under heavy bombardment by Russian forces.Ms. Grib’s tuberculosis was diagnosed in September 2020 and she took some of her medicines with her, but now is unsure how she might obtain the drugs long-term. Without treatment, her disease could become resistant to all available therapies, perhaps even claiming her life.“It’s very scary,” she said.At least 1,200 people with tuberculosis are thought to have fled Ukraine. The Alliance for Public Health, a nonprofit organization, is helping more than 400 such patients in countries like Poland and Moldova. The W.H.O., too, has readied a stockpile of tuberculosis drugs in Poland for refugees from Ukraine.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.But most of the refugees are women and children, while the majority of Ukrainians with drug-resistant TB are men who must stay in the country and fight, said Andriy Klepikov, executive director of the alliance.Within the country, staff members are delivering medicines to the sickest people in cities where it still is possible to travel, and mailing drugs to communities where post offices are still operational.Dr. Klepikov himself had 20 minutes to fill a backpack and evacuate from a suburb of Kyiv to Lviv. When he returned to Kyiv on a short trip earlier this past week, he was devastated by the destruction of apartment complexes, kindergartens and shopping malls within a few minutes’ walk from his building.“There are smell of heavy smoke, sound of bombing, artillery, sirens,” he wrote in a text message.ImageHumanitarian and medical supplies were loaded onto a train in Lviv bound for Dnipro.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesImageDestruction in Andriy Klepikov’s neighborhood in Kyiv, just a few minutes’ walk from his apartment.Credit...Andriy KlepikovImageSupplies for distribution by the Alliance for Public Health.Credit...Andriy KlepikovIn Lviv, a city that has become a refuge for displaced Ukrainians, the alliance’s staff members are delivering condoms, syringes and tests. But in many other cities, there is little the organization can do to help.Staff members have lost contact with colleagues in Mariupol, the southern city under siege by Russian forces; only the coordinator of the alliance’s mobile team called to confirm that she was alive. Staff members have also lost touch with 60 percent of their clients in the suburbs of Kyiv, which has been under attack for weeks.“What has been gained over these 20 years can be destroyed in days,” Dr. Klepikov said. “We will not allow this — we will fight for sustaining these gains.”More than one in four new H.I.V. infections in Ukraine occur among the country’s roughly 350,000 injecting drug users. Before the war, Ukraine’s policies on harm reduction enabled more than 17,000 of its citizens to receive so-called opioid substitution therapy.The demand for treatment has increased as access to street drugs has decreased during the conflict. But now stocks of the opioid substitution drugs methadone and buprenorphine are unlikely to last beyond one to two weeks, experts said.So the W.H.O. and other nonprofit organizations are requesting drug donations from the Czech Republic, Austria and other countries. The Global Fund, an enormous global health organization, has made more than $3 million available to purchase these treatments over the next year.Some experts worried that if Russian forces prevailed, Ukraine’s drug users would be in grave jeopardy. Opioid substitution therapy is illegal in Russia. Within 10 days of its annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia shuttered all of the methadone delivery centers, resulting in deaths from overdoses and suicides.“You can’t just stop these treatments from one day to the next,” Dr. Kazatchkine said.Women who use drugs face particular stigma and discrimination from state organizations and medical institutions, said Tetiana Koshova, regional coordinator in Kyiv for the Ukrainian Network of Women Who Use Drugs.Before the war, the organization helped 50 to 70 women each month, but now that number has doubled, Ms. Koshova said. Ms. Koshova got her diagnosis of H.I.V. in 2006, at age 27, and said she worried about the availability of H.I.V. drugs as the war grinds on. Although warehouses still hold stocks of antiretroviral medicines, “the situation can change in any moment, because rockets fly anywhere and destroy everything indiscriminately,” she said.She spent much of Tuesday “sitting in the basement” because of a threat of rocket attacks.“Explosions are constantly heard, and periodically there are problems with electricity,” she added. “All night and several times a day, I have to go in bomb shelter.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/health/ukraine-health-tb-hiv.html
1,"BORODIANKA, Ukraine — In a hastily organized show of support for Ukraine, Senator Steve Daines of Montana and Representative Victoria Spartz of Indiana traveled on Thursday to Kyiv and sites of rights abuses in the city’s suburbs, becoming the first American officials to turn up since the start of the war.“Nothing can substitute for actually being here, seeing it first-hand, spending time with the people and leaders here in Ukraine who have been horribly affected by this war,” Mr. Daines said in an interview, standing on a heap of rubble from an apartment building that had collapsed on its inhabitants in the town of Borodianka.It was important, he said, for American elected officials to show solidarity.Mr. Daines and Ms. Spartz, both Republicans, were invited by the Ukrainian government, with just over a day’s notice. Mr. Daines had broken off from a visit to Eastern Europe to make the trip. Ms. Spartz, who last year became the first Ukrainian-born lawmaker to serve in Congress, had planned an unofficial visit to Ukraine and later joined Mr. Daines for the trip supported by the Ukrainian government.Once in Kyiv, where they arrived by train from western Ukraine, the pair traveled by car escorted by the police on a route through stark scenes of destruction, blown-up Russian tanks and rubble, where rescuers were still searching for bodies. The two also observed an exhumation from a communal grave in Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv where hundreds of bodies were found on the streets after Russian forces retreated.The horror in Bucha — where some victims’ hands were bound and some had been shot in the head, in a sign of extrajudicial killings — has become emblematic of the war’s toll and a new touchstone of rights abuse in wartime in Europe. Several European delegations have also visited the site.The two Republican lawmakers arrived as the Biden administration is considering sending a high-level official to Kyiv in the days ahead as a sign of support, according to a person familiar with the internal discussions.President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have both made high-profile visits over the past month to countries neighboring Ukraine, and other top American officials have made similar visits, some coming close to the border. But no American official had publicly visited Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in late February, and the United States has evacuated all diplomats.Both Mr. Daines and Ms. Spartz said they were urging the United States to return diplomats to Ukraine as some European states have done now that Kyiv, the capital, is no longer under imminent threat of attack by Russia.“I hope that our visit will encourage more American officials and leaders to come, to stand with the people of Ukraine,” Mr. Daines said, while Ms. Spartz said it was “important to show our support, to show we care.”Standing in the rubble of the collapsed building, where Ukrainian officials have said that at least 21 people died, Mr. Daines found a child’s toy — a wooden car — and looked into apartments that had been peeled open by the explosion, revealing kitchen cabinets still hanging on a wall.In Bucha, the two watched the Ukrainian authorities remove three bodies from the tan clay soil of a churchyard where a communal grave was being excavated.Mr. Daines described what he had seen as “indisputable evidence of war crimes.”“It’s everywhere,” he said. “We’ve been driving for miles and miles and miles, seeing death and destruction caused by Vladimir Putin in this evil invasion.”Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry, said he had arranged the visit in the hope that more American lawmakers would follow, get a first-hand sense of the stakes in the war, and vote to provide additional weapons to Ukraine.Both Ms. Spartz and Mr. Daines said they supported bipartisan efforts in Congress to spur the Biden administration to deliver weapons to the Ukrainian Army more swiftly.“I think we should be providing the lethal aid that they need to win this war,” Mr. Daines said. “The humanitarian crisis will not end until the war ends. And the war will not end until the Ukrainians win.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/steve-daines-victoria-spartz-ukraine-kyiv.html
2,"Good evening. This is your Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, a weeknight guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict.Russia said it would sharply reduce attacks near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and on Chernihiv, a city in the north, but the U.S. was skeptical.A Russian strike in Mykolaiv destroyed a large portion of a regional government building, killing at least nine people and injuring 28 others.Oil prices dropped and stock prices jumped on news of progress in Ukraine-Russia talks.This map shows where Ukrainian forces have mounted counterattacks, as Russian troops have largely regrouped and tried to consolidate territory.Follow our live updates.ImageUkraine’s chief negotiator at the talks, David Arakhamia, right, with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Medinsky.Credit...Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Press ServiceSigns of progressRussian and Ukrainian envoys met for talks in Istanbul today as both sides put forward concessions that could be the first steps toward a draft peace agreement.Russia said it would “drastically” reduce its military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv, in the north. Ukraine for the first time proposed negotiations on the status of Crimea, to be conducted over 15 years.To a large extent, the diplomatic concessions reflect what is already the reality on the ground: Russia’s campaign to take Kyiv has stalled, and Russian forces have even been pushed back by Ukrainian counteroffensives. The Crimean peninsula has been under de facto Russian rule since it was annexed in 2014.Russia also said it was willing to prepare a meeting between its president, Vladimir Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Zelensky has sought such a meeting for months. The fate of the eastern Donbas region, which Russia no longer recognizes as part of Ukraine, could be discussed during that meeting, an aide to Zelensky said.The key to a peace agreement appeared to be Ukraine’s willingness to adopt a neutral status — including by not joining NATO or hosting Western troops — in exchange for international “security guarantees.” Ukraine’s chief negotiator at the talks, David Arakhamia, said discussions were underway between Ukraine and other countries to create a “working security mechanism” that would help protect Ukraine.While there was no agreement on a cease-fire at the talks, the offers on the table marked the most progress yet in diplomatic efforts to end the war, now in its fifth week.Still, the U.S. was skeptical. “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that continues as we speak.”Analysts said any concessions offered at peace talks might be no more than a tactic, with Russia in no hurry to end the war. “This is a chance for the Russians to consolidate, to regroup, to remove themselves from places out of reach logistically, where they have already run out of food and ammunition,” said François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.ImageYulia Beley, center, with her daughter and friends from Mariupol at a shelter in Lviv.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesHunger as a weapon of warAfter they surrounded Mariupol last month, Russian forces systematically cut off the city from everything its citizens needed to live: electricity, water, gas and food. About 160,000 people are believed to be trapped inside the city, in one of the war’s worst humanitarian crises.Yulia Beley, who sheltered in a neighbor’s basement, said she and her three daughters shared one bowl of porridge a day. “It tears you apart,” said Beley, 33, still traumatized after her escape from the city a week ago. “I just sobbed, just cried, screaming into the pillow when no one could see.”The siege of Mariupol is only the latest use of an ancient warfare tactic that uses hunger to turn people’s own bodies against them.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“Siege is a way to break the will and humiliate — and finally to control,” said Mouna Khaity, a health and gender researcher who lived through the Syrian government’s five-year siege of Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus. Sieges serve not only to flush out combatants, she said, but also to send a message to everyone trapped inside: “You are not an equal human to me. You don’t deserve to eat, drink, have medicine or even breathe!”Doctors who study hunger and starvation describe a grim process of the body mining itself to stay alive. A well-nourished adult can survive for more than 70 days on water alone; children, the elderly and the ill succumb more quickly.Related: Carlotta Gall, our Istanbul bureau chief who is now in Ukraine, wrote about how the brutal tactics that Russia used in its war in Chechnya have resurfaced in Ukraine.What else we’re followingIn UkraineThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Ukraine for talks on protecting the country’s nuclear facilities.Russian forces detained the head of the education department in the occupied city of Melitopol after teachers resisted orders to overhaul the curriculum.Ukrainian officials say that reports of sexual violence involving Russian soldiers are increasing.Ukraine’s telephone and internet company blamed Russia for the large cyberattack it suffered yesterday.In RussiaThe Dutch brewer Heineken and its Danish rival Carlsberg are leaving Russia.The French sporting goods giant Decathlon said that it would suspend operations at its 60 stores in Russia.Around the worldGermany’s newly muscular foreign policy is in the hands of three women: the defense, foreign affairs and homeland security ministers.

3,"In a Russian-occupied village, five men went off to feed cattle. Their relatives and neighbors are wondering what happened to them.HUSARIVKA, Ukraine — The cows wouldn’t stop screaming.Russian soldiers had occupied this remote village in eastern Ukraine for about two weeks and were using a farm as a base. But the animals at the farm hadn’t been fed. Their incessant bleating was wearing on both occupiers and townspeople.A group of five residents from Husarivka, an unassuming agricultural village of around 1,000 people, went to tend the cattle.They were never heard from again.“My two nephews disappeared. They went to feed the cows on the farm,” said Svitlana Tarusyna, 70. “They are gone, vanished.”What transpired in Husarivka has all the horrifying elements of the more widely publicized episodes involving Russian brutality: indiscriminate killings, abuse and torture taking place over the better part of a month.Human rights workers around Kyiv, the capital, are gathering evidence of Russian atrocities, hoping to build the case for war crimes. But for the villagers here, the occupation’s legacy is not measured in mass killings, corpses or ruined buildings, but in the disappearances of friends and neighbors.Though the residents are free of Russian occupation, questions about what exactly happened during those troubled days will linger for years to come.ImageLubov Dvoretska, 62, a biology teacher whose husband was killed in a bombing. Her neighbors buried his body in the garden behind their house.The Russian soldiers were, for the most part, reserved after their arrival in Husarivka in the first days of March, residents said. But that quickly changed. They looted empty homes. Then they started stealing from the people who had stayed behind. It was around the time Ms. Tarusyna’s nephews and their colleagues disappeared that the occupation turned violent.“At first, they were not wandering anywhere around at all,” said Yurii Doroshenko, 58, who is Husarivka’s de facto mayor, noting that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were hunkered down at their headquarters — a collective farm — on the outskirts of the village. “Then, three or four days later, they started to sneak around, searching. It was around March 10 that they started to come into the houses.”Wedged between rolling wheat fields, tracts of sunflowers and natural gas lines, Husarivka is about 60 miles southeast of Kharkiv, once Ukraine’s second-largest city. Its capture by the Russians was part of a broad advance westward that included troop movements from near Kharkiv and the more eastern city of Izium, where Russian and Ukrainian units are still locked in battle.The Russian campaign stalled, and Ukrainian forces managed to rout Russian troops from the village in late March.Husarivka is only about three miles from the front line, and it continues to be shelled incessantly, much as it was when the Russians held the area. The power and water have been out since early last month and cell service is practically nonexistent, leaving the village all but isolated except for the humanitarian aid ferried in from surrounding towns.In recent days, residents have slowly started to piece together what transpired in their enclave, emerging from their basement shelters between artillery strikes. But they have been left with more questions than answers, such as: Where are the five people who disappeared around March 16 after heading off to feed the cows? Mr. Doroshenko pointed to his frayed list of people who had disappeared or died, some from natural causes, during the occupation. The names and dates of death were written in blue ink.ImageA list of people in Husarivka who died, some from natural causes, or went missing during the occupation. “This is Yehor Shyrokin,” he said. “He was a foreman at the farm. Sergiy Krasnokutsky was working as a security guard. Olexandr Tarusyn was handing out the fodder. Olexandr Gavrysh was a tractor driver. Mykola Lozoviy was the Gazelle driver,” he said, referring to a transport truck.Before the war, 1,060 people were registered as residents of Husarivka, Mr. Doroshenko noted on Thursday, as dark clouds rolled over his village and the thud of artillery echoed in the distance. Now most people have fled, and he estimated the number had shrunk to around 400.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.In the days leading up to the disappearances, only one resident had been killed during the occupation. On March 8, Ukrainian forces tried to retake Husarivka, and during the fighting Sergiy Karachentsev, a driver, was killed, said Mr. Doroshenko. Some residents said he was fleeing to meet his wife in a neighboring town when Russian troops stopped his car and shot him.“His car, an old Opel, is still there,” the village chief acknowledged.As the occupiers settled into Husarivka and ransacked the homes, their interactions with residents became more frequent.ImageA damaged house in Husarivka. Oleksandr Khomenko, 43, a beekeeper, echoed the accounts of a half-dozen other residents: The Russian forces were undersupplied and demanded alcohol and food. One woman refused to give up her pig, so they went next door and shot the neighbors’ pig, the woman said. They also took cellphones and other electronics, presumably to stop residents from contacting Ukrainian forces and providing information about the Russian troops’ location. Or so they could call home.“We were holding on to our tablet for a long time,” Mr. Khomenko said. “The Russian soldier took me aside and said: ‘What’s more dear to you, your wife and kid or the tablet? I will take your tablet anyway, and you should only choose whether they will live or die.’”He gave them the tablet. Sometime during the second week of the occupation, several days after the power went out, the cows started to roar. Some of the Russians and their armored vehicles were holed up in a tractor garage by the cattle pens and had stopped people from working at the collective farm, called Husarivkse. As a result, the animals languished.“There were over 1,000 cattle here,” said Anatoliy Isitchenko, 67, the deputy director of the agricultural company that ran the cluster of farm buildings.ImageA woman who remained in the village during the Russian occupation.“Here is what they did,” he said of the occupiers. “On this street next to the farm, they told the guys who worked there as machine operators and foremen to go and feed the livestock.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

But as they left, something on the farm exploded, residents recalled. Whether it was an artillery strike or an attempt at sabotage is unclear, but it seemed to contribute to their disappearance; Mr. Doroshenko stated that the Russians captured the men after the explosion. It is possible they were behind some type of attack on the Russian headquarters.“They only got to the crossroad and were seized,” Mr. Doroshenko said.Two other people near the farm also went missing that day, Mr. Doroshenko added. Roughly a week later, on March 24, a Russian sniper shot and killed Andriy Mashchenko as he rode home on his bicycle. He had been sheltering in a neighbor’s basement during an artillery barrage. He died on Peace Street.Under heavy bombardment, the Russians retreated from Husarivka about two days later, and Ukrainian forces swept through afterward. The town’s casualty tally during the occupation: seven people missing, two killed by gunfire and at least two by shelling.Evidence scattered around the town showed how artillery had ruled the day. Spent rockets lay in fields. Roofs were caved in. The rusted hulks of Russian vehicles were seemingly everywhere. In one armored personnel carrier, the corpse of what was presumed to be a Russian soldier remained, barely recognizable as someone’s son.ImageRussian military meal boxes scattered on the roadside near Husarivka.But as Ukrainian soldiers sifted through the battlefield wreckage after their victory, they found something on Petrusenko Street. It was in a backyard basement sealed shut by a rusted metal door.“In this cellar the bodies were found,” said Olexiy, a chief investigator in the region who declined to provide his last name for security reasons. He gestured down into a soot-covered hole. “They were covered by car tires and burned,” he said.“There is no way to tell the cause of their death,” he added, “We found three hands, two legs, three skulls.”The bodies have yet to be identified, he said. Residents of Husarivka believe the three had been part of the group of five who disappeared. Images provided to The New York Times clearly showed that a rubber work boot was melted to the foot of one leg.But hauntingly, no one knows for sure what happened to the five men. Many of the cows they went to feed ended up being killed by the shelling.ImageA destroyed Russian armored vehicle in Husarivka.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-atrocities.html
4,"WARSAW — President Biden delivered a forceful denunciation of Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, declaring “for God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” as he cast the war as the latest front in a decades-long battle between the forces of democracy and oppression.Ending a three-day diplomatic trip to Europe with a fiery speech outside a centuries-old castle in Warsaw, Mr. Biden described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the “test of all time” in a post-World War II struggle between democracy and autocracy, “between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.”“In this battle, we need to be cleareyed,” Mr. Biden said in front of a crowd waving Polish, Ukrainian and American flags. “This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”Mr. Biden used the speech to bolster a key NATO ally on Ukraine’s western border that has served as a conduit for Western arms and has absorbed more than 2 million refugees fleeing the violence, more than any other country in Europe. And he sought to prepare the public, at home and abroad, for a grinding conflict that could drag on for weeks, months or longer.Just hours before the event, missiles struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, about 50 miles from the Polish border, extending Russia’s monthlong assault on major cities and civilian populations — and undercutting Russian statements a day earlier suggesting Moscow might be scaling back its goals in the war.ImageSmoke billowing from a building in Lviv after a Russian missile attack on Saturday.Credit...Vladyslav Sodel/ReutersWhile declaring that “the Russian people are not our enemy,” Mr. Biden unleashed an angry tirade against Mr. Putin’s claim that the invasion of Ukraine was intended to “de-Nazify” the country. Mr. Biden called that justification “a lie,” noting that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is Jewish and that his father’s family was killed in the Holocaust.“It’s just cynical,” Mr. Biden said. “He knows that. And it’s also obscene.”It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Biden’s apparent call for the ouster of Mr. Putin was one of the off-the-cuff remarks for which he is known or a calculated jab, one of many in the speech. But it risks confirming Russia’s central propaganda claim that the West, and particularly the United States, is determined to destroy Russia.The White House immediately sought to play down the remark. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,” a White House official told reporters. “He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Mr. Putin’s fate was not in the hands of the American president. “It’s not for Biden to decide,” Mr. Peskov told reporters. “The president of Russia is elected by the Russians.”Experts were divided on whether Mr. Biden’s remark was intended to signal he believed Mr. Putin should be ousted, a political escalation that could have consequences on the battlefield.ImageMr. Biden with President Andrzej Duda of Poland in Warsaw.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesRichard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter that the White House’s attempt to walk back the president’s comment was “unlikely to wash.”“Putin will see it as confirmation of what he’s believed all along,” he wrote. “Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.”Mr. Biden’s statement that Mr. Putin could no longer remain in power could be perceived “as a call for regime change,” said Michal Baranowski, a senior fellow and director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund, a nonpartisan policy organization. But he said he did not read it that way, and that Mr. Putin was unlikely to, either. “I think just what President Biden was saying is, how can such a terrible person be ruling Russia?” said Mr. Baranowski. “In that context, I don’t think it will lead to any escalation with Russia.”Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and assured him that the United States considered its support for NATO to be a “sacred obligation.”“America’s ability to meet its role in other parts of the world rests upon a united Europe,” Mr. Biden said.While Poland’s right-wing, populist government has been embraced by Washington and Brussels as a linchpin of Western security, it has provoked quarrels with both in the past. Mr. Duda, however, thanked Mr. Biden for his support, saying that Poland stood ready as a “serious partner, a credible partner.”At a stadium in Warsaw, Mr. Biden met with Ukrainian refugees in his first personal encounter with some of the civilians ensnared in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis caused by weeks of indiscriminate Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities and towns.ImageMr. Biden meeting Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw on Saturday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAfter speaking with the refugees, including several from the city of Mariupol, which has been flattened by Russian shelling, Mr. Biden called Mr. Putin “a butcher.”That comment also prompted a retort from Mr. Peskov, who told TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, that “such personal insults narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations with the Biden administration.Mr. Biden also met with Ukrainian ministers in his first in-person meeting with the country’s top leaders since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, part of what American officials hoped would be a powerful display of the United States’ commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.“We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defense cooperation will evolve,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told reporters, the Reuters news agency reported.But Mr. Biden gave no indication that the United States was willing to budge from its previous rejection of Ukrainian requests to establish a no-fly zone over the country or to provide it with the MIG-29 warplanes that Poland offered some weeks ago.As Mr. Biden visited Poland, two missiles struck Lviv, rattling residents who ran into underground shelters as smoke rose into the sky. Lviv’s mayor said a fuel storage facility was on fire, and a regional administrator said five people had been injured.ImageMr. Biden with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defense Minister Oleskii Reznikov of Ukraine in Warsaw on Saturday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAlthough Russian missiles hit a warplane repair factory near Lviv on March 18, the city, which had 700,000 residents before many of them fled the war, has otherwise been spared the airstrikes and missile attacks that have hammered other Ukrainian population centers.Mr. Biden ended his trip one day after a senior Russian general suggested that the Kremlin might be redefining its goals in the war by focusing less on seizing major cities and instead targeting the eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Mr. Biden’s administration was quietly exploring the implications of the statement by the Russian general, Sergei Rudskoi, which indicated that Mr. Putin might be looking for a way out of the brutal invasion he launched with confidence and bravado a month ago.Western intelligence agencies have in recent weeks picked up chatter among senior Russian commanders about giving up the effort to take Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and other key areas in the north and west of the country, according to two people with access to the intelligence. Instead, the commanders have talked more narrowly of securing the Donbas region.Military analysts have cautioned that General Rudskoi’s statement could be intended as misdirection while Russian forces regroup for a new offensive.ImageA Ukrainian soldier inspecting the remains of a destroyed Russian T90 tank on the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday.

Medvedev, the vice chairman of Russia’s Security Council, restated Moscow’s willingness to use nuclear weapons against the United States and Europe if its existence was threatened.“No one wants war, especially given that nuclear war would be a threat to the existence of human civilization,” Mr. Medvedev told Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency in excerpts from an interview published on Saturday.Hoping to rally his country and encourage negotiations with Moscow, Mr. Zelensky said that the success of a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began two weeks ago was “leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: Talk is necessary.”For the moment, large portions of Ukraine remain a battleground in what has increasingly come to resemble a bloody stalemate between the smaller Ukrainian army and Russian troops that have struggled with logistical problems.On Saturday, Russian forces entered the small northern city of Slavutych, near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where they seized the hospital and briefly detained the mayor, a regional military official said.ImageIn a picture obtained by Reuters from social media on Saturday, Russian soldiers and armored vehicles stood guard in the distance as dozens of residents of Slavutych, Ukraine, chanted, “Glory to Ukraine.” Credit...via ReutersIn response, dozens of residents unfurled the Ukrainian flag in front of city hall and chanted, “glory to Ukraine,” prompting Russian troops to fire into the air and throw stun grenades, according to videos and the official, Oleksandr Pavliuk.Michael D.

6,"Natasha Hrytsenko, a lifelong resident of Ukraine, had always dreamed of having a fluffy white dog. When she started working, Ms. Hrytsenko, now 30, used her first two paychecks to buy a purebred mini Maltese puppy. She brought Eddie home to the Kyiv apartment that she shared with her older sister.Eight years later, when war engulfed their country and they decided to flee, Ms. Hrytsenko recalls telling her sister: “I can leave behind my best clothes, my favorite bags and even my cellphone. But I will never leave Eddie behind.”The pair made their way to Poland, then Germany, then Portugal, bound eventually for the United States, where they had friends in Virginia. The tiny dog journeyed with them, tucked under their arms or plopped on their laps.The sisters made it as far as Tijuana, the Mexican city on California’s southern border, before they heard the news that stopped them short: Dogs from Ukraine were in most cases not being allowed into the United States. A number of people had already had to leave their pets behind in Mexico under federal health regulations.“I would rather go back to Europe,” Ms. Hrytsenko told her sister.Among the thousands of Ukrainians who have been lining up at the southern border since the Russian invasion, the past few weeks have been marked by a painful progression of loss: homes, loved ones, jobs, the quiet comfort of familiar neighborhoods. For those who had managed to carry a beloved pet along on their journey to an uncertain future, the barrier at the border has proved devastating.“He is everything to us,” Ms. Hrytsenko’s sister, Ira, 31, said of the dog.ImageNatasha Hrytsenko, left, and her sister, Ira, after they were reunited with Eddie. Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageSome pet owners were devastated when they learned they could not enter the United States with their pets. “I would rather go back to Europe,” Natasha told her sister.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times“The number of dogs here has been growing day by day,” said Victoria Pindrik, a volunteer with the Save Ukraine Relief Fund, which has been working with Ukrainian refugees who are attempting to enter the United States. “Dogs have been sent back to us.”The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prohibits except on an “extremely limited basis” any dogs from entering the United States if they have been in any one of roughly 50 countries, including Ukraine, that it classifies as “high risk” for rabies.At the crowded border crossing in Tijuana, where a dedicated pedestrian lane has been opened to speedily process Ukrainian refugees, Customs and Border Protection agents initially allowed a number of pets into the country, volunteers working at the border said. But more recently, pets from Ukraine have not been allowed.The Hrytsenko sisters had taken steps as soon as they left Ukraine to make sure their dog would be prepared for international travel.Volunteer veterinarians gave Eddie his first rabies shot in Poland and his second in Germany, where veterinarians also inoculated him against parasites, implanted a microchip in his neck and provided him with paperwork and an international ID to ensure he could travel.The sisters planned to travel to the United States through Mexico, a roundabout trip that thousands of refugees have attempted because of delays in setting up a legal pipeline for Ukrainians to enter the United States. Mexico does not require visas, so refugees have been able to fly to Mexico and apply for admission on humanitarian grounds at the U.S. land border.The sisters boarded a flight from Lisbon to Mexico without a problem, their suitcases stuffed with cans of Newman’s Own organic chicken dog food. Eddie came along in a small portable carrier.After they landed in Cancún last week, an animal inspector at the airport reviewed their paperwork and examined Eddie from head to toe. He handed over an official document with a stamp attesting to the dog’s good health. The sisters flew to Tijuana on Sunday.ImageFor those who have managed to carry a beloved pet along on their journey to an unknown future, the barrier at the border has proved devastating.

Maya, a Chihuahua, was denied entry until an American brought her in.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesThere, they joined hundreds of Ukrainians waiting their turn to cross the border. In no time, Eddie was bounding gleefully across the mats that lined a large gym that had been transformed into a massive dormitory for refugees.“We felt confident, trusting everything was fine,” Ira recalled. “Then, all of a sudden, we heard you can’t cross with your dog.”After their trip of more than 6,000 miles, across four international borders, this barrier seemed the most formidable. They considered reversing their steps.Ms. Pindrik, the American volunteer working with the refugees in Tijuana, said the process for gaining legal access to the United States under current procedures, which include a permit and possible quarantine, could take weeks.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 1:35 p.m. ETExplosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.For years, the U.S. sent mixed signals about its interests in Ukraine. Then Putin made his move.“For many of these families that have been through trauma, it is important to keep their family together, including their pets that they spent so much energy, money and care to bring with them,” she said. “We understand the requirements the U.S. has in place and reasons for them, but it is impossible for the refugees to satisfy them.”The C.D.C. said it had issued a number of permits for people arriving from Ukraine with their pets. “We are working with NGOs in Mexico and the U.S. along the border to ensure persons arriving from Ukraine with their dogs meet entry requirements before entering the U.S., or that they have a safe place to quarantine dogs if they arrive and do not meet C.D.C. entry requirements,” the agency said.Among the Ukrainians who managed to cross the border with their pet before enforcement of the rabies ban appeared to have been stepped up was Anastasiia Derezenko, who crossed after spending a few nights in Tijuana with her husband and two children. They entered the United States with their mini Maltese, Luka, last week, she said, after visiting a Mexican veterinarian who gave them the necessary paperwork.“When American immigration police took us, we had Luka in our arms. Everything was very, very OK,” Ms. Derezenko said from Portland, Ore., where her family is staying with friends. Luka, who is 6 months old, has become fast friends with their hosts’ pups.“He came all the way from Brovary with us, and it was very difficult trip,” she said, referring to the Ukrainian city just east of Kyiv.More recent arrivals, like the Hrytsenko sisters, have been warned to not even try to enter the United States with their pets.ImageIra and Eddie in California.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageThe C.D.C. in July temporarily suspended the entry of dogs from “high-risk” countries for rabies, a long list that includes Ukraine, according to the agency’s website. Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesFor the sisters, it seemed an impossible barrier. Then they learned there was a temporary solution: Mexico is not on the C.D.C. rabies list, and Americans bringing dogs from that country are unlikely to face scrutiny at the U.S. border. In fact, Americans arriving with dogs from a low-risk or rabies-free country are not even required to present a rabies vaccination certificate or special permit.Several days ago, American animal lovers began ferrying dogs belonging to Ukrainians across the border themselves. Several dozen Ukrainian pets, mainly dogs but also cats, have already made their way to California with American help. The Hrytsenko sisters began looking for someone who would agree to take Eddie.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.On Tuesday evening, they were informed that No. 3748, their designated number in line, should join a group at the border checkpoint, where the sisters would be escorted into California for processing by U.S. authorities.At first, they were elated. Their monthslong odyssey was about to end.Then they learned there was no American to take Eddie across until the following day.“We broke into pieces,” Natasha said. “We did not want to leave Eddie overnight. We have never left him alone. He is really tied to us.”They postponed their passage to the United States until the next morning after being assured that Eddie would be delivered to them shortly after.On Wednesday, at about 10 a.m., they placed Eddie in his white-and-gray crate near the gym, where they were told he would be picked up.The dog began gnawing on the slits and the door of the crate, recalled Natasha, who said that she was overcome with guilt. Both sisters began crying.“You can’t explain to a dog that everything is going to be OK,” Natasha said.ImageEddie taking a bath. Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageMaya, the Chihuahua, had a bath after being delivered to her family at a hotel in San Ysidro.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesAfter crossing into the United States, the pair joined another Kyiv native, Liuba Pavlenko, a fellow dog owner with whom the sisters had bonded in Tijuana. Ms. Pavlenko and her two children were waiting at a hotel in San Ysidro, near San Diego, for their Chihuahua, Maya, to be brought from Mexico.“I’m sorry that Maya and Eddie had to be refugees and endure this journey,” Ira said when they met at the hotel.The families grew anxious as the day wore on.“I’m getting impatient,” Natasha said. It was after 3 p.m., more than five hours since they had left Eddie in the crate.Then their phone rang with a live video from the border, showing Eddie being carried toward the port of entry into the United States. They peered at the screen, trying to determine how their dog was holding up.“Oh my God, he has aged,” Natasha said.“Look at him. He’s probably thirsty. He hasn’t eaten,” her sister said.About 45 minutes later, both dogs were reunited with their owners, who smothered them with hugs and kisses.Then it was bath time.Natasha scrubbed Eddie clean in the tub with the special White on White shampoo that, along with the organic pet food, she had made sure to pack in her single suitcase.Only then were they ready for the final leg of their journey — to Virginia, where their friends awaited.What happens next for Ukrainian dog owners in Tijuana is unclear. Ms. Pindrik said a local shelter had agreed to start looking for a way to help pet owners. In the coming days, new immigration regulations are expected that will allow Ukrainians to fly directly to the United States, where they could face similar hurdles at airports until the C.D.C. updates its guidelines.For the Hrytsenkos, the only thing that mattered was that Eddie had made it. They ordered an Uber and headed for the airport, five hours before their flight.Ira said it was better to be early than run into problems they had no time to solve. “We don’t want to take any chances with Eddie not getting on the plane.”Mark Abramson contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/us/ukrainian-refugees-dogs-us-border.html
7,"Ukrainian officials acknowledged Friday that Russian forces had taken more than three dozen small towns in their initial drive this week to seize eastern Ukraine, offering the first glimpse of what promises to be a grinding brawl by the Kremlin to achieve broader territorial gains in a new phase of the two-month-old war.The fighting in the east — along increasingly fortified lines that stretch across more than 300 miles — intensified as a Russian commander signaled even wider ambitions, warning that the Kremlin’s forces aimed to take “full control” of southern Ukraine all the way to Moldova, Ukraine’s southwest neighbor.While it seemed unlikely that the commander, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev, would have misspoken, his warning still drew skepticism, based on Russia’s probable difficulty in starting another broad offensive and the general’s relatively obscure role in the hierarchy. But his threat could not be ruled out.The broader war aims that he outlined at a defense industry meeting in a Russian city more than 1,000 miles away from the fighting would be far more ambitious than the downscaled goals set out by President Vladimir V. Putin in recent weeks, which have focused on gaining control of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.Some political and military experts suggested the general’s statement could have been part of Russia’s continuing efforts to distract or confuse Ukraine and its allies. General Minnekayev’s official job involves political propaganda work and does not typically cover military strategy.ImageUkrainian soldiers on Friday in the Zaporizhzhia region, in Donbas, in an area about two to three miles from where Russian soldiers are fighting.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesOn Friday, fierce fighting was underway across a band of southeastern Ukraine, engulfing communities on the banks of the Dnipro River. While Ukrainian officials acknowledged that Russia had taken control of 42 small towns and villages in recent days, they said those same places could be back in Ukrainian hands before long. Western analysts said Russia’s forces, in both the slow but largely successful fight for the southern city of Mariupol and the unsuccessful battle for Kyiv, had been battered and weakened. But rather than resting, reinforcing and re-equipping the forces, Moscow is pressing forward in the east.The Russian military appears to be trying to secure battlefield gains — including capturing all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, or oblasts — ahead of May 9, when Moscow holds its annual celebration of its World War II victory.“They’re not taking the pause that would be necessary to re-cohere these forces, to take the week or two to stop, and prepare for a wider offensive,” said Mason Clark, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. “They’ll likely be able to take some territory. We do not think they’re going to be able to capture the entirety of the oblasts in the next three weeks.”In his remarks on Friday, General Minnekayev asserted that one of Russia’s goals was “full control of the Donbas and southern Ukraine.”He said that would allow Russia to control Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, “through which agricultural and metallurgical products are delivered” to other countries. Still, despite repeated attacks, Russia has failed to seize those ports, including Odesa, a fortified city of 1 million people.“I want to remind you that many Kremlin plans have been destroyed by our army and people,” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, wrote on social media in response to General Minnekayev’s remarks.General Minnekayev also issued a veiled warning to Moldova, where Moscow-backed separatists seized control of a 250-mile sliver of land known as Transnistria in 1992.“Control over the south of Ukraine is another connection to Transnistria, where there is also evidence of oppression of the Russian-speaking population,” the general said, echoing false claims of a “genocide” against Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine that Mr. Putin used to help justify the Feb. 24 invasion.The Moldovan government later summoned the Russian ambassador to complain, saying that General Minnekayev’s comments were “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”Transnistria has never been recognized internationally — not even by Russia. But Russia keeps 1,500 soldiers there, nominally to keep the peace and guard a large Soviet-era munitions cache.ImageRussian troops at the entrance of the village of Varnita, part of a 1,500-member force in Transnistria ostensibly for peacekeeping.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York TimesA poor country of 2.6 million, Moldova is considered vulnerable to further Russian incursions. It is not a member of NATO or the European Union, but it hastily applied for E.U. membership last month.Yuri Fyodorov, a Russian military analyst, said that the broader aims detailed by General Minnekayev “from the military standpoint are unreachable.”“All of Russia’s combat-ready units are now concentrated in the Donbas, where Russia failed to achieve any significant advances over the past five days,” Mr. Fyodorov said in an interview. General Minnekayev’s rank, he said, would generally not allow him to make such sweeping policy statements that also contradict what has been said by the country’s top leaders.Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, declined to comment on General Minnekayev’s remarks.As Western allies race to arm Ukraine with increasingly heavy, long-range weapons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, on a visit to India on Friday, said his country was considering sending tanks to Poland so that Warsaw could then send its own tanks to Ukraine. The Biden administration said this month that it would also help transfer Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine.The Russian Defense Ministry, in its first statement on casualties from the April 14 sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, said that one crew member had died, 27 were missing and 396 had been evacuated. Relatives of at least 10 Moskva crew members had voiced frustration over the Kremlin’s silence, which was turning into a test of its strong grip on information that Russians receive about the war.Ukraine said it had sunk the Moskva with two missiles — an assertion corroborated by U.S. officials — while Russia claimed that an onboard fire had caused a munitions explosion that doomed the ship.ImageThis photograph provided by the Russian military shows the missile cruiser Moskva near the Syrian coast in 2015.Credit...Russian Defense Ministry PressAs Russia hardened its crackdown on any domestic opposition to the war, it opened a criminal case against Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian pro-democracy activist and a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, for spreading “false information,” his lawyer said Friday.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Mr. Kara-Murza, 40, arrested earlier this month, faces 10 years in prison, according to the official decree against him posted online by his lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov.It said he was being investigated for remarks he had made before Arizona lawmakers on March 15. Mr. Kara-Murza told a local news outlet in Phoenix that month that Russia was committing “war crimes” in Ukraine but that “Russia and the Putin regime are not one and the same.”“Americans should be infuriated by Putin’s escalating campaign to silence Kara-Murza,” Fred Ryan, the publisher of The Post, said in a statement. Mr. Putin, who has become increasingly vilified in the West over the war, has not completely rejected diplomatic engagement. On Friday, he agreed to meet with the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, in Moscow next week, a stark change from his refusal to even take Mr. Guterres’s phone calls. Still, the meeting did not signal a softening of Mr. Putin’s views on Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that he has said should not even be a sovereign country.Ukraine’s government said the fighting had made it too dangerous to organize any evacuations from a war that Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called a “horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians.”After another attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Friday, residents watched as smoke rose over shops. In the ruined port of Mariupol, hundreds of civilians and the last organized Ukrainian fighters remained trapped in a sprawling steel plant, issuing urgent pleas for help from underground bunkers. Newly released satellite images of the city showed hundreds of hastily dug graves, lending credibility to Ukrainian claims that Russia was trying to cover up atrocities.VideoAnd in the Zaporizhzhya region of south-central Ukraine, Ukrainian troops were dug in about two miles from Russian forces that were trying to push north in an effort to fortify a land bridge connecting Russian territory with the Crimean Peninsula, which Mr. Putin annexed in 2014.ImageLt.

9,"Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, women around Poland have been making trips to the Polish-Ukrainian border to offer rides to the multitudes of refugees seeking safe passage out of the country.Most of the more than four million people who have fled Ukraine are women and children, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And because both groups are at high risk of exploitation and trafficking, the volunteer collective Women Take the Wheel is helping them make the journey.“Feeling safe and secure is one of humans’ basic needs,” said Ella Jarmulska, 38, an entrepreneur from a village on the outskirts of Warsaw who helped found the group and serves as one of the drivers. “To provide them with some sense of security was as basic a reaction as giving water to a thirsty person,” she said.Women Take the Wheel, an informal group with about 600 members, uses Facebook, WhatsApp and other messaging platforms to communicate and coordinate assistance.The amplified perils that women and children face are part of what motivated Ms. Jarmulska to issue an appeal for female drivers on Facebook after making her first trip to the border, near the town of Dorohusk. On that trip at the onset of the war, Ms. Jarmulska saw dozens of men standing by their cars outside the reception sites — hastily erected centers for arriving refugees — “looking like bouncers at a club.”As a woman, Ms. Jarmulska empathized with those arriving, alone or with children, after a difficult journey to a different country where the language is foreign and men, however well-intentioned, are offering rides, sometimes late at night. It can “add to the trauma and state of fear,” she said.“What can I do to make it easier on them?” Ms. Jarmulska asked herself that evening.ImageElla Jarmulska, center, smiled after driving Wayne, Dana and their 10-day-old son, Sebastian, to Warsaw as part of her effort with Women Take the Wheel.Credit...Ella JarmulskaKasia Garbarska saw the discussion on Facebook and an opportunity to further mobilize the effort, suggesting the volunteers travel in groups: an extra safety precaution, she said, and a way to maximize space.Through her job with the marketing department in Warsaw’s City Hall, where she has worked with some of the reception points for refugees in the city, Ms. Garbarska heard the fears that female refugees expressed, including the dangers associated with taking rides from unknown men.“They do not feel safe,” said Ms. Garbarska, 56, who volunteers as a driver at least once a week. “So if we can do anything to make them feel a little bit safer, that is what we have to do.”There is no vetting process for the drivers, but that is being addressed, Ms. Jarmulska said, adding that she closely examined a person’s Facebook profile before accepting any request to join. Some cars are outfitted with blue-and-gold signs of the group’s name and its logo — a van with the symbol for “women” underneath it. (The image was designed by Ola Jasionowska, the artist behind the lightning bolt that became the image of the women’s movement in Poland two years ago.) And volunteers are instructed to check in at reception centers and with the local authorities before offering any transportation.Women Take the Wheel will offer transportation and widen its network of female volunteers as long as there is a need, Ms. Jarmulska said. It’s a matter, she said, of “showing up with your hand out and heart open.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/poland-women-ukraine-refugees.html

11,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is vigorously debating how much the United States can or should assist an investigation into Russian atrocities in Ukraine by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations.The Biden team strongly wants to see President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and others in his military chain of command held to account. And many are said to consider the court — which was created by a global treaty two decades ago as a venue for prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide — the body most capable of achieving that.But laws from 1999 and 2002, enacted by a Congress wary that the court might investigate Americans, limit the government’s ability to provide support. And the United States has long objected to any exercise of jurisdiction by the court over citizens of countries that are not part of the treaty that created it — like the United States, but also Russia.The internal debate, described by senior administration officials and others familiar with the matter on the condition of anonymity, has been partly shaped by a previously undisclosed 2010 memo by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Obtained by The New York Times, the memo interprets the scope and limits of permissible cooperation with the court.The discussions have also been marked by Pentagon opposition to softening the U.S. stance, even as congressional Republicans, long skeptics of the court, have signaled openness to finding a way to help it bring Russian officials to justice.For now, officials said, the primary focus has been on compiling evidence of apparent war crimes that are still unfolding — both the details of particular killings and intelligence that President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, asserted on Sunday indicates a high-level plan to brutalize the civilian population into terrorized subjugation.“This was something that was planned,” he said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding, “Make no mistake, the larger issue of broad-scale war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine lies at the feet of the Kremlin and lies at the feet of the Russian president.”But the unresolved deliberations about where to channel such intelligence explain why administration officials have been hazy about where efforts to prosecute Russian war crimes should center — even as evidence of large-scale atrocities has mounted, prompting Mr. Biden to label Mr. Putin a “war criminal” and to call for a “war crimes trial.”Mr. Sullivan was vague, for example, at a news briefing last week when a reporter asked whether the president envisioned such a prosecution playing out at the International Criminal Court or some other tribunal.ImageAs evidence of large-scale atrocities has mounted, President Biden labeled President Vladimir V. Putin a “war criminal” and called for a “war crimes trial.”Credit...Kenny Holston for The New York Times“We have to consult with our allies and partners on what makes most sense as a mechanism moving forward,” he said. “Obviously, the I.C.C. is one venue where war crimes have been tried in the past, but there have been other examples in other conflicts of other mechanisms being set up.”But setting up other venues would raise its own obstacles. Among them, while the United Nations Security Council in the past helped establish special international courts to handle conflicts in places like Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, Russia can veto any Council resolution seeking to establish a tribunal for Ukraine.There are reasons to doubt that Mr. Putin and other senior Kremlin officials responsible for the war may ever stand trial, so long as they remain in power and ensconced in Russia. Still, war-crimes indictments, human rights specialists say, serve a “naming and shaming” function even without trials — and can inhibit defendants’ ability to travel abroad.Another possibility is a nation’s court with jurisdiction over war crimes on Ukrainian soil. Germany, for example, has war-crimes and crimes-against-humanity laws that cover the world. Prosecutors there said in March that they had started gathering evidence of deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and two former ministers filed a complaint there last week asking prosecutors to charge Russian officials.Ukraine’s own prosecutor general has asked for international help in gathering evidence. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in recent days that administration officials were working on a multinational effort to shore up Ukraine’s efforts, while also holding discussions with European counterparts.Still, with Ukraine under continuing assault, the capacity of its justice system may be limited. The International Criminal Court, by contrast, is already set up — and it specializes in conducting this very kind of investigation and prosecution.ImageThe bodies of civilians reportedly killed by Russian forces and wrapped in plastic in a mass grave in Bucha last week.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesAgainst that backdrop, the State Department has said that the United States “welcomed the fact” that the court has opened an investigation into the war in Ukraine, and Biden administration officials are weighing what the United States can do to help it.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 9:01 a.m. ETFires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.Shelling echoes around Kharkiv after an Easter lull.Tens of thousands are without power as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine.One set of issues is primarily legal. A group of top national security lawyers across the administration has been wrestling with how to navigate the limits imposed by a pair of laws that Congress enacted a generation ago. Those laws curtail the aid the American government may provide to the court, but are ambiguous in places.The deliberations have centered on a 26-page opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel that interpreted those laws for the executive branch.The memo looked at the kinds of assistance that the United States had offered to the tribunals for war crimes and genocide in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which proved crucial to making them work — like sending dozens of experienced Justice Department prosecutors and contributing more than $500 million to cover operational costs.But a 1999 appropriations law bars the government from spending funds to support the International Criminal Court. The memo concludes that Congress banned both donating money to the court directly and donating material items, like supplying a computer system or building a courthouse — and that the law permits no exceptions.The memo also analyzes a 2002 law, the American Servicemembers Protection Act. It bars giving the court other kinds of support — like sharing intelligence, training its staff or lending it personnel. The memo concludes that the United States cannot offer general institutional support, but can provide such help for “particular cases.”Unlike the funding ban, the 2002 law permits “rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to justice” a list of offenders from that era, like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, along with any other foreign citizens who are accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity.Even as administration lawyers struggle with how much wiggle room the government has as it tries to hold Russia accountable, there are signs of bipartisan interest in Congress in potentially rescinding or modifying those laws so the United States can more broadly help the court.Last month, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, backing any investigation into war crimes committed by Russian forces and proxies. It praised the International Criminal Court and encouraged “member states to petition the I.C.C.” to investigate and prosecute Russian atrocities — as at least 41 nations have done.Mr. Graham has since been working with Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, on what they hope will be fast-track, bipartisan legislation responding to outrage over events in Ukraine.Their initial focus, Mr. Graham said in an interview, has been on developing legislative language to expand the domestic War Crimes Act so that American courts would have jurisdiction over such crimes by noncitizens abroad.ImageSenator Lindsey Graham said the International Criminal Court appeared “to be the only venue that works” for investigating Mr. Putin.Credit...Michael A. McCoy for The New York TimesBut Mr. Graham said that the International Criminal Court appeared “to be the only venue that works” for investigating Mr. Putin. He said Congress would also “look at the laws on the books and see if they need to be changed to make sure these investigations can be supported, either financially or to provide any intelligence or manpower.”A related issue under discussion among administration officials is whether the United States should soften its longstanding objection to the court exercising jurisdiction over citizens from a country that is not a party to its treaty, according to officials.On the table is whether those decisions should instead depend on whether a particular country has a functioning justice system that can handle allegations of war crimes. The rationale is that it would be legitimate for the court to investigate Russian war crimes because Mr. Putin and his commanders appear to be committing them with domestic impunity.Pentagon officials, however, are said to be balking. They contended that moving to a case-by-case approach would be shortsighted because it would make it harder for the United States to argue against court investigations into potential war crimes by American forces, officials said.Some opponents of changing the American position are also said to have pointed to Israel — an ally that is also not a party to the treaty. The United States has objected to an investigation by the court of potential war crimes by Israeli forces.But calls for shifting the U.S. position are growing louder.Mr. Graham asserted that the court was set up to deal with situations only where the rule of law has collapsed — unlike the court systems in the United States or Israel, he said. By contrast, he argued, “there is no rule of law in Russia any more than there would be in certain parts of Africa” where the court has prosecuted warlords for atrocities.And in a Washington Post opinion column last week, John Bellinger, a national security lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, and Christopher J. Dodd, a former Democratic senator who was responsible for adding the exception to the 2002 law, argued that “U.S. support for an I.C.C. investigation of Russian war crimes would not constitute a double standard or be inconsistent with U.S. objections to the court’s claimed jurisdiction over U.S. personnel.”While most of the world’s democracies joined the court a generation ago — including close U.S. allies like Britain — many American leaders were wary, fearing that it could be used or misused someday to prosecute American forces.In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed the 1998 treaty creating the court, known as the Rome Statute, but he also called it flawed and never submitted it to the Senate for ratification. Two years later, Mr. Bush essentially withdrew that signature.ImageCharred cars outside the train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, on Friday after a missile strike that killed more than 50 people.Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesStill, by 2008, Mr. Bellinger — then the top State Department lawyer — declared that the United States accepted the “reality” of the court, acknowledging that it “enjoys a large body of international support.” The Obama administration bolstered its efforts to prosecute warlords in Africa, offering rewards for the capture of fugitives indicted by the court.Relations plunged during the Trump administration, when a top prosecutor for the court tried to investigate the torture of terrorism detainees during the Bush administration. The government imposed sanctions on court personnel, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced it as corrupt.But in 2021, the Biden administration revoked those sanctions and a new top prosecutor dropped the investigation.In light of that history, the unanimous vote for the Senate resolution supporting the International Criminal Court represented a striking change. Mr. Graham attributed that shift to the “war crimes spree” by Mr. Putin.“I would say this is one of Putin’s bigger accomplishments,” Mr. Graham said. “I didn’t think it was possible but he did it — and that’s for him to rehabilitate the I.C.C. in the eyes of the Republican Party and the American people.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/us/politics/us-russia-ukraine-war-crimes.html

13,"Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian civilians and soldiers in recent days have made clear that its withdrawal from northern Ukraine is more an attempt to reset Vladimir Putin’s invasion than a full retreat. The focus now is on the battle for eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have deployed brutal tactics.Russia struck a train station crowded with civilians in Kramatorsk in the eastern part of the country on Friday, killing at least 50 people and wounding many more. In a video of the scene, one woman shouted, “There are so many corpses, there are children, there are just children!”Russia has also reorganized its command in Ukraine. The general now in charge of the invasion reportedly ordered strikes on civilian neighborhoods during a brutal Russian campaign in Syria.Analysts expect Russia to carry out a major offensive toward Dnipro, a city that is a strategic target in east-central Ukraine. Yesterday, Russian strikes rained down on the airport there, wounding rescue workers.And U.S. analysts saw Russian troops in and around the city of Izium, north of Kramatorsk, preparing to push on to Dnipro and other strategically important cities.“We are being encircled. We understand that,” Tetiana, 50, a shopkeeper who works next to the bombed train station in Kramatorsk, told my colleagues Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia Yermak yesterday. Putin’s apparent goal is to cement control over the Donbas region in Ukraine’s east, where Russia-backed separatists have fought for years, and potentially secure a land bridge to Crimea in the south, which Russia has controlled since 2014.Russia will likely continue to bomb cities across the country to keep Ukraine from sending troops and resources to the east, experts said. But the bulk of Russian soldiers on the ground — including newly hired mercenaries and Syrian troops — will set up camp and fight in eastern Ukraine.Russian officials “have learned some of their lessons,” my colleague Julian Barnes, who covers national security, told me. “They spread out their forces too much; they’ve realized that. They used poorly trained forces to try to take Kyiv.” He added, “They underestimated Ukrainians.” (The Washington Post also found other ways Russia botched the start of its invasion.)What happens after the battle for the Donbas region, and whether Russian forces will shift their focus back to the rest of Ukraine, is less clear. “I don’t think anybody can know right now,” Julian said. “I don’t think Putin can know.”ImageAn abandoned Russian military vehicle near Kharkiv.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAn uncertain futureThe success or failure of Russia’s campaign in the east will shape the legacy of Putin’s war — and Ukraine’s fate.If the fighting in the east is tough, or if Russia falls short of a clean victory, Putin might start to look for a way out of the war. If Russia wins more decisively, Putin could try to push into the rest of Ukraine once again, perhaps aiming to take out Ukrainian leadership and install a puppet regime.“I don’t think the Kremlin has abandoned its very maximalist aims,” said Mason Clark, the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. “It’s just been forced to revise them downward.”The conflict is looking more like a war of attrition, Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at the national security think tank CNA, told me. And the violence could get even worse in the next phase, as Russian forces directly assault Ukrainian troops and bomb cities in an attempt to cut off Donbas from the rest of the country. Western officials have said that Putin would like to claim some sort of win by May 9, when Russia celebrates its victory in World War II. The date could act as a deadline for Putin’s decision on the next phase of the war. “I’m not sure the Russian military could sustain current operations much beyond that anyway,” Clark said.But some experts were skeptical. “I’m sure Putin would love to get a total victory in the Donbas by May 9,” Kofman said. “But you know what happens when he doesn’t get it? He’ll try to get it the day after.”More on Ukraine“I now call it the road of death.” The bodies of dozens of civilians were found on a highway to Kyiv, some shot and others burned, a local official said.Inside the campaign of terror and revenge against civilians in Bucha.More than half of Ukraine is farmland.

Last year, book-banning efforts surged to their highest level in two decades, according to the American Library Association.Many of the targeted books were by, or about, Black and L.G.B.T.Q. people. Among the most challenged, according to the A.L.A., were “Gender Queer,” an illustrated memoir by Maia Kobabe that discusses coming out as gender nonconforming, and “The Hate U Give,” a young adult novel by Angie Thomas about a Black teenager whose friend is shot by a police officer. Part of the reason for the surge is that parents use social media to circulate lists and coordinate banning efforts. And librarians say they’ve noticed more heavy-handed tactics from government officials and others, such as political pressure over certain books (like Toni Morrison’s “Beloved”) and legal threats against the people who choose reading material.Read the A.L.A.’s list of the 10 most targeted books.PLAY, WATCH, EATWhat to CookImageCredit...Dane Tashima for The New York Times.

14,"The crime first came to light last week, when Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said in a Facebook post that a Russian soldier had killed an unarmed civilian and then repeatedly raped his wife. Days later, the White House said it was concerned about emerging reports of sexual violence in Ukraine.Then on Monday night, The Times of London published the woman’s chilling account. Using the pseudonym Natalya, she told a reporter she had been in her home in a village near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, when she heard footsteps and a shot rang out. Moments later her husband lay dead outside her front door, and two Russian soldiers were at her side, one holding a gun to her head.“I shot your husband because he was a Nazi,” the gunman told her, before he and the other soldier raped her, as her 4-year-old son sobbed in a boiler room next door, according to The Times. She said she was later raped a second time by the soldiers, and eventually managed to flee to western Ukraine with her son.“I could have been silent, but when we got to the police, my husband’s sister made me speak up, and there was no going back,” she was quoted saying in The Times. “I understand that many people who have been hurt would stay silent because they are afraid. Lots of people don’t believe terrible things like this happen.”A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, rejected Ms. Venediktova’s allegation, telling reporters in Moscow last week that “we don’t believe it at all.”“It is a lie,” Mr. Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.Ms. Venediktova said a Russian soldier is wanted for arrest “on suspicion of violation of the laws and customs of war.”Ukrainian officials contend that numerous cases of rape and sexual violence have occurred in the country since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24.Maria Mezentseva, a Ukrainian member of parliament, detailed the woman’s account to Sky News on Sunday and said there were “many more victims.” She did not provide further details or say how she learned of other assaults, but said that she expected them to come to light once the victims were “ready to talk.”“We will definitely not be silent,” she said.Rape and other forms of sexual violence, which have accompanied armed conflicts throughout history, can constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russian forces and Moscow-backed armed groups have been accused of perpetrating sexual violence in other conflicts — most recently involving detainees in eastern Ukraine.This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that he had little confidence that international organizations, like the International Criminal Court in The Hague, would hold Russian soldiers to account. “When Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities — it’s difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of international law,” he said via videolink during an event at Chatham House, a think tank in London.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Accounts of rape and sexual violence began to emerge almost immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine, according to Kateryna Busol, an associate with Chatham House and a Ukrainian lawyer who documented allegations of sexual violence following Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea in 2014.“These accounts are growing, and we are hearing that they are much more widespread than the one account raised by the inspector general,” Ms. Busol said in a phone interview from Regensburg, Germany, where she fled from Kyiv in the days following the invasion.“What we are hearing by word of mouth, from acquaintances of survivors in the country, is horrific,” she added. “I have had described to me incidents of gang rape, rape in front of children and sexual violence following the killing of family members.”Most of the accounts, she said, involved female victims and were coming from cities in Ukraine’s east and the south occupied by Russian forces.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russian-soldiers-sexual-violence-ukraine.html

The reports could not be independently confirmed.Mr. Kvedaravicius, 45, had spent years covering the conflict in Ukraine. His film “Mariupolis,” which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2016, offers a searing portrait of the southern port city, which battled Russian-backed fighters in 2014. In a 2016 interview with the Odessa Review, a monthly magazine, Mr. Kvedaravicius said that he had wanted to capture “how regular people carry on with their everyday lives mere steps away from a war zone, gunshots, explosions and death.” “The factories, the sea, the omnipresent soldiers, the sounds of the violin blending with the sound of the exploding shells — all of this forms the surrealism of an ordinary city during wartime,” he told the Odessa Review.Since Russia’s invasion, Mariupol has emerged as an emblem of the humanitarian crisis sweeping Ukraine. Weeks of Russian bombardment on the city have trapped thousands of civilians with limited access to food, water and electricity.In 2011, Mr. Kvedaravicius was awarded the Amnesty International Film Prize for “Barzakh,” his film about Russia’s war in Chechnya.As reports of Mr. Kvedaravicius’s death circulated on Sunday, fellow filmmakers and journalists posted messages of mourning and condolences on social media.“RIP dearest talented Mantas. A terrible loss for Lithuanian cinema community and all the world,” Giedre Zickyte, a fellow Lithuanian documentary director and producer, wrote on Facebook. “Our hearts are broken.”Vitaly Mansky, a Russian film director, wrote that Mr. Kvedaravicius was killed “with a camera in his hands” while working to document a “war of evil, against the whole world.”The news of Mr. Kvedaravicius’s death came after the death of a prominent Ukrainian photojournalist filmmaker, Maks Levin, whose body was found near the capital of Kyiv on Saturday, according to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/world/europe/mantas-kvedaravicius-killed-mariupol.html
16,"LUBMIN, Germany — Past a nudist beach and a sleepy marina, a gigantic mesh of metallic pipes rises from the pine forest behind the tiny village of Lubmin on Germany’s Baltic coast.If few people have heard of Lubmin, from Berlin to Washington almost everyone seems to know the name of the two gas pipelines arriving here directly from Russia: Nord Stream 1, which carries almost 60 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to keep Europe’s biggest economy humming. And Nord Stream 2, built to increase that flow but abruptly shuttered in the run-up to Russia’s attack on Ukraine.The pair of pipelines has become a twin symbol of Germany’s dangerous dependence on Russian gas — and the country’s belated and frenzied effort to wean itself off it — with calls growing for the European Union to hit Moscow with tougher sanctions as atrocities come to light in Ukraine.On Tuesday, the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive branch, proposed banning imports of Russian coal and soon, possibly, its oil. But Russian gas — far more critical to Germany and much of the rest of Europe — was off the table. At least for now.“We are dependent on them,” said Axel Vogt, the mayor of Lubmin, which has a population of just 2,119, as he stood in the industrial harbor between the two pipelines one recent morning. “None of us imagined Russia ever going to war. Now Russia is one of our main suppliers of gas and that’s not something we can change overnight.”ImageAngela Merkel, then chancellor of Germany, and Dmitry Medvedev, then Russia’s president, fifth from left, were among those symbolically starting the flow of gas through the Nord Stream Baltic Sea gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany, in 2011.Credit...Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThat dependence on Russia — accounting for more than a quarter of Germany’s total energy use — has meant that Berlin has so far refused to cut off President Vladimir V. Putin, whose war it is effectively subsidizing to the tune of an estimated 200 million euros, or about $220 million, in energy payments every day.The images of mass graves and murdered civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha have horrified Europe and spurred demands for a Russian energy embargo, especially among Germany’s eastern neighbors.“Buying Russian oil and gas is financing war crimes,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, the foreign minister of Lithuania, which has stopped all Russian gas imports. “Dear E.U. friends, pull the plug. Don’t be an accomplice.”Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany reacted swiftly to the images from Bucha, condemning the “war crimes committed by the Russian military,” expelling 40 Russian diplomats and promising new and tougher sanctions on Moscow. Germany’s network regulator went so far as to take over the German subsidiary of Gazprom, Russia’s main gas company and owner of Nord Stream.Europe’s Shift Away From Fossil FuelsThe European Union has begun a transition to greener forms of energy. But financial and geopolitical considerations could complicate the efforts.A Seminal Moment: Last July, Europe unveiled a plan to pivot away from fossil fuels over the next nine years. Here is a closer look at it.A Controversy: The E.U. will label some nuclear power and natural gas plants as sustainable investments. Critics say it’s “greenwashing.”Rewiring for the Future: As climate change bears down, Greece is betting on clean energy in an attempt to reshape its economic destiny.The Costs of the War: The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven up energy prices and complicated Europe’s switch to greener sources.But government ministers have, for now, ruled out a ban on Russian gas imports. The reasons are clear.ImageThe site of a mass grave, in Bucha, Ukraine, on Sunday. Pressure on Germany to cut off Russian energy sources has grown as the atrocities of the war have come to light.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesOne in two German homes is heated with gas, and gas also powers much of Germany’s vaunted export industry. For years, Berlin happily relied on Moscow for more than half of its gas imports, a third of its oil and half of its hard coal imports, ignoring warnings from the United States and other allies about Russia weaponizing its energy supplies.Quitting that habit will not be easy in the short term without a shock to a German economy that like others in Europe is still recovering from the pandemic.“Our strategy is to become independent of Russian gas, coal and oil — but not immediately,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister and vice chancellor, who has been busy traveling to Qatar and Washington in search of alternative gas contracts.The government is taking steps to make Germany independent of Russian coal by the summer, and of Russian oil by the end of the year. Already, the share of oil imports from Russia has fallen to 20 percent and Russian coal imports have been halved.But gas — on which Germany is banking as a bridge toward its goal of a carbon neutral economy by 2045 — is an entirely different matter. Mr. Habeck and others said that becoming independent of the Russian supply would take at least two years.“We can’t substitute gas in the short term,” Christian Lindner, the finance minister said. “We would harm ourselves more than them.”It has not helped that Germany committed itself to phasing out nuclear power under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, leaving the country more reliant on Russia than before. The legacy of that decision can be seen in Lubmin, too.ImageLubmin’s mayor, Axel Vogt, at the entrance of the industrial port and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline outside his village.Credit...Lena Mucha for The New York TimesBehind the gleaming pipelines are the outlines of a shuttered nuclear power plant, once the biggest in the Communist East Germany. The same year that Ms. Merkel celebrated the opening of Nord Stream 1, she announced that Germany would be quitting nuclear power. The last three nuclear plants are scheduled to come off the grid this year.“That was a huge mistake, which in light of what’s happening now is more evident than ever,” said Mr. Vogt, the mayor.Even before Russia’s attack on Ukraine, plans by Mr. Scholz’ new coalition to simultaneously phase out nuclear power and coal while turning Germany into a carbon-neutral economy looked ambitious.Now even politicians with the Greens, like Mr. Habeck, are exploring what it would take to keep the last nuclear plants running longer. Some worry that the 2030 deadline for closing the last coal plants might also have to be pushed back.But the pressure for a swift exit from Russian fossil fuels is growing even within Germany, with some arguing that rooted in its own history of genocide, Germany had a moral obligation that trumped economic considerations.ImageA coal train passing through Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2020. “Our strategy is to become independent of Russian gas, coal and oil — but not immediately,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister and vice chancellor.Credit...Maxim Babenko for The New York Times“The country that proudly proclaims that Europe will ‘never again’ see the likes of Auschwitz is pumping 200 million euros each day into Putin’s war chest,” the financial newspaper Handelsblatt wrote in an editorial. “All of a sudden the discussion in Germany about whether our economy would grow by 6 percent or just 3 percent in the event of an energy embargo seems petty and insignificant. We resemble a hostage to the Kremlin.”Russia’s war on Ukraine was a wake-up call for Germany, which for decades had bet that trade and economic interdependence with Moscow would keep the peace in Europe.But, within days of the invasion, Mr. Scholz vowed to break with the energy policy of Ms. Merkel and her predecessor Gerhard Schröder, who still sits on the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft and chairs the shareholders committee of Nord Stream 2.Mr. Vogt, the mayor of Lubmin, remembers hosting Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schröder in 2011. They had come to open the gas spigot with Dmitri Medvedev, then Russia’s President. “This gas pipeline will make Europe’s energy supply significantly safer,” Mr. Schröder said at the time.In February, after Mr. Scholz suspended Nord Stream 2, Mr. Medvedev, now deputy chair of the Russian security council, said on Twitter: “Welcome to a new world, in which Europeans will soon pay 2,000 euros for 1,000 cubic meters gas.”On her morning walk along the beach and past the pipelines in Lubmin one recent morning, Petra Krüger, a 57-year-old radiologist assistant and mother of two, said she was worried about rising energy costs and was only heating in the afternoons now. She recalled the excitement in the village when the original Nord Stream pipeline was built after years of industrial decline.“It felt like the community had gained this long-term lifeline,” she recalled.“We were all fooled,” she added. “We should have never allowed ourselves to become this dependent. It’s scary.”Image “We should have never allowed ourselves to become this dependent. It’s scary,” said Petra Krüger, a resident of Lubmin, standing near the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.Credit...Lena Mucha for The New York TimesRising energy costs not only in Germany but also across Europe have raised questions of who will be hurt more by a Russian energy embargo — Mr. Putin or the West.Some argue that Germany should cut the gas ties first.“We should act before Putin does,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a conservative lawmaker and member on the foreign affairs committee of the German Parliament.The prospect of Mr. Putin himself closing the gas tap is a scenario that the German government is actively preparing for. Last week, Mr. Habeck activated the first step of a national gas emergency plan that could eventually lead to the rationing of natural gas.Every day, a crisis team of government representatives, regulators and private industry meets to monitor gas supplies. If they start running low, the government will intervene to begin rationing natural gas supplies. Households and critical public services, including hospitals and emergency services, would be prioritized over industry, according to a planning document.Not only Nord Stream is controlled by Russia. So is Germany’s — and Western Europe’s — biggest gas storage facility, which was taken over by Gazprom in 2015 along with others. Some of these facilities have been running conspicuously low, say German officials, who spy a strategic move by Moscow.“We must increase precautionary measures to be prepared for an escalation on the part of Russia,” said Mr. Habeck, the economy minister, urging German consumers and companies to begin making efforts to cut their energy use wherever possible.ImageA tour bus with a message of solidarity with Ukraine, parked in Lubmin. Polls suggest that Germans are willing to pay more for gas as a trade-off for punishing Russia.Credit...Lena Mucha for The New York Times“Every kilowatt-hour counts,” he said.But already there is the concern that Germany will trade one dependency for another.Long term, the strategy is to accelerate Germany’s move into renewable energies — or “freedom energies,” as the finance minister called them. The government is offering new subsidies for the wind and solar sector. Until a decade ago, Germany was a leader in solar production. Today, 95 percent of solar cells and 85 percent of solar modules are made in China.“If Russia and China ganged up on us right now, they could flatten us,” said Gunter Erfurt, chief executive of Meyer Burger, the only European company currently making solar modules with its own solar cells. “We need to bring solar manufacturing back to Europe. Europe needs to diversify and fast.”“We have a lot of sun and wind up here,” Mr. Vogt said. “Maybe that’s the next chapter.”Christopher F.

18,"ROME — Pope Francis on Saturday inched closer to blaming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for invading Ukraine and said that a trip to Kyiv was possible as he arrived in Malta for a short visit emphasizing the plight of migrants, an issue that has long topped the pontiff’s agenda and that has become critical with the war in Ukraine.On the flight to Malta from Rome, Francis responded to a reporter’s question about visiting Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, by saying that it was “on the table.” Then in his address to the dignitaries and officials in a frescoed government chamber in Malta, Francis blamed a “potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests,” for casting “dark shadows of war” from Europe’s east.Francis has refused to explicitly cite Mr. Putin or Russia as the aggressor for a variety of reasons, including the Vatican’s hopes of playing a part in a potential peace agreement, and out of precaution so as to not endanger Roman Catholics across the world. But on Saturday, he clearly seemed to be speaking about Mr. Putin, who, Francis said, was “provoking and fomenting conflicts.”“We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,” the pope added. “However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all.”ImageCivilians on Tuesday fleeing Irpin, the scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks in Ukraine.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesFrancis, 85, spoke on Saturday during his 36th foreign trip since his election in 2013, but those years have taken a toll on him. He boarded the plane in Rome with the help of an elevator, as an inflamed ligament in his right knee and sciatica have recently increased his limp and reduced his mobility.Once in Malta, he walked with difficulty — and with the help of an aide. Vatican officials raised concerns about his sailing later in the day on a catamaran to the island of Gozo and his navigating the steps into the Grotto of St. Paul on Sunday in Rabat, in northern Malta.The trip, originally planned for May 2020, was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and now comes amid another unforeseen global disaster, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bombing of civilians and forcing of another migration crisis. Before leaving Rome, he met with Ukrainian mothers and children who had escaped the war.The pope, wearing his white robes over black pants, met with officials and dignitaries of an island that, according to the Scriptures, welcomed the Apostle Paul with “unusual kindness” when he was shipwrecked there, an image he played on in his address to appeal for better treatment of migrants.“Paul was a man, a man in need of assistance,” Francis said. “Humanity is first and foremost: That is the lesson taught by this country whose history was blessed by the arrival of the shipwrecked apostle.”ImageFrancis met with Malta’s president, George Vella, and other dignitaries at the presidential palace on Saturday in Valletta, Malta.Credit...Andreas Solaro/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHe said that according to its Phoenician etymology, Malta means “safe harbor.”“Nonetheless, given the growing influx of recent years,” Francis said, “fear and insecurity have nurtured a certain discouragement and frustration.”Migrant advocates in recent years have accused Malta of turning away desperate people from its shores. And even on Friday, Maltese news media reported that a ship carrying about 100 people rescued in international waters sought safe harbor in Malta, but that the government had refused to let them disembark.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.On Saturday, Francis said that “from the poor and densely populated south, great numbers of people are moving to the wealthy north — this is a fact, and it cannot be ignored by adopting an anachronistic isolationism.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The pope urged for cooler heads in the face of an “infantile and destructive aggression that threatens us, before the risk of an enlarged Cold War.” Francis has long appealed for disarmament, a position he has maintained, even as Europe seeks to defend itself in the face of a growing Russian threat. Last month, he angrily said he was “ashamed when I read that a group of states has committed to spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on the purchase of weapons, as a response to what is happening now — the madness!”Instead, he has talked about achieving global peace through undefined “international relations,” which would replace a model governed by “economic-technocratic-military power.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/pope-francis-russia-putin-ukraine.html
19,"WASHINGTON — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been misinformed by his advisers about the Russian military’s struggles in Ukraine, according to declassified U.S. intelligence.The intelligence, according to multiple U.S. officials, shows what appears to be growing tension between Mr. Putin and the Ministry of Defense, including with the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin’s inner circle. Speaking in Algiers, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken acknowledged Mr. Putin had been given less than truthful information from his advisers.“With regard to President Putin, look, what I can tell you is this, and I said this before, one of the Achilles' heels of autocracies is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power,” Mr. Blinken said. “And I think that is something that we’re seeing in Russia.”In a news conference on Wednesday afternoon, a Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, said that the Defense Department believed that Mr. Putin has not had access to an accurate account of his army’s failures in Ukraine.“We would concur with the conclusion that Mr. Putin has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense, at every turn over the last month,” Mr. Kirby said.“If Mr. Putin is misinformed or uninformed about what’s going on inside Ukraine, it’s his military, it’s his war, he chose it,” Mr. Kirby said. “And so the fact that he may not have all the context — that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting, to be honest with you.”Other American officials have said that Mr. Putin’s rigid isolation during the pandemic and willingness to publicly rebuke advisers who do not share his views have created a degree of wariness, or even fear, in senior ranks of the Russian military. Officials believe that Mr. Putin has been getting incomplete or overly optimistic reports about the progress of Russian forces, creating mistrust with his military advisers.Mr. Putin seemed genuinely unaware that the Russian military had been using conscripts in Ukraine, and that drafted soldiers were among those killed in action, according to the U.S. officials. Mr. Putin’s ignorance showed “a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president,” according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the declassified, but still sensitive, material. There “is now persistent tension” between Mr. Putin and the Defense Ministry, the official said.The American intelligence assessment also said that Mr. Putin had an incomplete understanding about how damaging Western sanctions had been on the Russian economy, officials said. The war continues to go poorly for Russian forces. Ukraine’s military has not only held its own but also begun counterattacking. Some U.S. officials believe that senior Russian officials are wary of delivering truthful assessments — potentially afraid that the messengers of bad news will be held responsible for the battlefield failures.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

While Mr. Shoigu had been considered one of the few advisers Mr. Putin confided in, the prosecution of the war in Ukraine has damaged the relationship. Mr. Putin has put two top intelligence officials under house arrest for providing poor intelligence ahead of the invasion, something that may have further contributed to the climate of fear.With evidence of Mr. Putin’s frustration growing, the United States has in recent weeks been building up an intelligence case that he had not been getting accurate assessments from the Ministry of Defense and other senior officials. The U.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin is continuing to be misled and that senior advisers are unwilling to tell the truth.What American intelligence sources there might be in the Kremlin is a tightly held secret. But since Russia began its troop buildup along Ukraine’s borders last year, U.S. intelligence officials have accurately predicted Mr. Putin’s moves.The declassified information was reported earlier on Wednesday by The Associated Press.Russian forces announced a shift in their posture around Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Tuesday, though American officials voiced skepticism that Russia was stopping its attacks as a peace gesture. Rather, some believe the moves are a further sign that Russia is adjusting its failing strategy. It is also possible that the shifting strategy is a sign of dysfunction and miscommunication in the upper ranks of the Russian Defense Ministry.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/world/europe/putin-advisers-ukraine.html
20,"The City Council of Mariupol, Ukraine, was trying to make a point about mass death. Their city had been hit hardest by the Russian invasion, and thousands of corpses lay amid the rubble after weeks of urban warfare. After the revelation of Russian atrocities in Bucha and other cities in northern Ukraine, the elected representatives of the port city wished to remind the world that the scale of killing in the south was still higher. In dry and sober language, they described the fates of Mariupol residents. Occasionally, though, emotion slipped through: In passing, the council members referred to the Russian perpetrators by a term of condemnation that every Ukrainian knows, though it is not yet in the dictionaries and cannot (yet) be said in English: “рашизм.”As Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv region, and photographs of the corpses of murdered civilians appeared in media, Ukrainians expressed their horror and condemnation with this same word. As I read about Irpin, about Bucha, about Trostyanets, of the bodies crushed by tanks, of the bicyclists shot on the street, of the desecrated corpses, there it was, “рашизм,” again and again, in comments sections, in social media, even in the official pronouncements of the Ukrainian state. As Russia renews its attempt to destroy the Ukrainian state with its Easter offensive in the Donbas, Ukrainians will keep using this new word. Grasping its meaning requires crossing differences in alphabet and pronunciation, thinking our way into the experience of a bilingual society at war with a fascist empire. “Pашизм” sounds like “fascism,” but with an “r” sound instead of an “f” at the beginning; it means, roughly, “Russian fascism.” The aggressor in this war keeps trying to push back toward a past as it never happened, toward nonsensical and necrophiliac accounts of history. Russia must conquer Ukraine, Vladimir Putin says, because of a baptism a thousand years ago, or because of bloodshed during World War II. But Russian myths of empire cannot contain the imagination of the Ukrainian victims of a new war. National identity is about living people, and the values and the futures they imagine and choose. A nation exists insofar as it makes new things, and a national language lives by making new words.The new word “рашизм” is a useful conceptualization of Putin’s worldview. Far more than Western analysts, Ukrainians have noticed the Russian tilt toward fascism in the last decade. Undistracted by Putin’s operational deployment of genocide talk, they have seen fascist practices in Russia: the cults of the leader and of the dead, the corporatist state, the mythical past, the censorship, the conspiracy theories, the centralized propaganda and now the war of destruction. Even as we rightly debate how applicable the term is to Western figures and parties, we have tended to overlook the central example of fascism’s revival, which is the Putin regime in the Russian Federation.The origins of the word “pашизм” give us a sense of how Ukrainians differ from both Russians and Americans. A bilingual nation like Ukraine is not just a collection of bilingual individuals; it is an unending set of encounters in which people habitually adjust the language they use to other people and new settings, manipulating language in ways that are foreign to monolingual nations. I have gone on Ukrainian television and radio, taken questions in Russian and answered them in Ukrainian, without anyone for a moment finding that switch worthy of mention. Once, while speaking Ukrainian on television, I stopped for a moment to quote a few words of poetry in Russian, a switch that was an effort for me. But Ukrainians change languages effortlessly — not just as situations change, but also to make situations change, sometimes in the middle of a sentence, or even in the middle of a word.“Pашизм” is a word built up from the inside, from several languages, as a complex of puns and references that reveal a bilingual society thinking out its predicament and communicating to itself. Its emergence demonstrates how a code-switching people can enrich language while making a horrific war more intelligible to themselves. Putin’s ethnic imperialism insists that Ukrainians must be Russians because they speak Russian. They do — and they speak Ukrainian. But Ukrainian identity has as much to do with an ability to live between languages than it does with the use of any one of them. ImageA billboard in Kyiv in March calling for Russian soldiers not to become murderers.Credit...Yuliia Ovsyannikova/Ukrinform, via Getty ImagesUkrainian is written in Cyrillic, and so pausing upon “рашизм” in this, its original form, will help with the mental calisthenics required to apprehend things the way the Ukrainians do. Seeing those six characters, you might be tempted to begin by making them Latin ones. But languages work together in a complex way, especially in the minds of people who speak more than one of them natively. As Rimbaud and the Hasidim (who came from Ukraine) knew, each letter has magic. We have to go slowly.Those six Cyrillic letters contain references to Italian, Russian and English, all of which a mechanical, letter-by-letter transliteration would block. The best (if imperfect) way I have found to render “рашизм” from Ukrainian into English is “ruscism” — though not what the standard protocol of transliteration would suggest, this gestures at both the word’s origins and its meaning. When we see “ruscism” we might guess this word has to do with Russia (“rus”), with politics (“ism”) and with the extreme right (“ascism”) — as, indeed, it does. A simple way to think about it is as a conglomerate of the “r” from “Russia” and the “ascism” from “fascism”: Russian fascism. This is barely the beginning of the story, but it starts us down the path toward the linguistic playfulness that makes the word possible, and toward the accumulation of meaning drawn from each sound.I have had to spell “рашизм” as “ruscism” in English because we need “rus,” with a “u,” to see the reference to Russia. In losing the original Ukrainian “a,” though, we weaken a multilayered reference — because the “a” in “рашизм,” conveniently, allows the Ukrainian word to associate Russia and fascism in a way English cannot.But wait: How can the “ra” (written “pa” in Cyrillic) suggest Russia in Ukrainian? You might guess that “Russia” in Ukrainian also has an “a” in the first syllable, but it does not. It’s spelled with an “o”: Росія. You might remember that Ukrainians also know Russian, and guess that perhaps the word for “Russia” in Russian is spelled with an “a.” It’s not: In Russian, too, the word has an “o” as its first vowel. But the guess puts us on the right track. We are about to see that Ukrainians can play with Russian in ways that Russians cannot — that a Ukrainian word can contain within it a reference to Russia that Russians themselves would never catch.If you don’t know either language, you might think that Russian and Ukrainian are very similar. They are pretty close — much as, say, Spanish and Italian are. If you know one, you have a tremendous advantage in learning the other. But you do still have to learn it. Russian grammar is similar to Ukrainian — perhaps a tad closer than, say, Ukrainian and Polish — but the semantics are not that close. From a Russian perspective, the false friends are legion. There is an elegant four-syllable Ukrainian word that simply means “soon” or “without delay,” but to a Russian it sounds like “not behind the bar.” The Ukrainian word for “cat” sounds like the Russian for “whale,” while the Ukrainian for “female cats” sounds like Russian for “intestines.”Russians do not understand Ukrainian, because they have not learned it. Ukrainians do understand Russian, because they have learned it. This fact has battlefield implications. Ukrainian soldiers often speak Russian, though they are instructed to use Ukrainian to spot infiltrators and spies. This is a drastic example of a general practice of code-switching. President Volodymyr Zelensky generally used Russian as a comedian and almost always uses Ukrainian as a politician — except for when he might switch, midspeech, to using Russian to address Russians, in the full knowledge that Ukrainians will follow along. ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressing the United Nations Security Council via video link on April 5.Credit...Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesTo switch back and forth between kindred languages requires a lively knowledge of the differences between them. One difference between Ukrainian and Russian has to do with that “ah” sound, which appears more often in Russian. In both languages, the vowel “a” consistently generates this sound. In Russian, though, a written “o” can do it, too. A salient example is the Russian word for “liberation” — “освобождение.” This is transliterated the way it looks, as “osvobozhdenie,” but sounds more like “asvobazhdenie,” with each “a” pronounced as an “ah.” To a Ukrainian ear, this is a very Russian word. The Ukrainian counterpart — визволення, vyzvolennia — sounds completely different (though it is almost identical to the Polish wyzwolenie).The Russian освобождение is also laden with decades of Soviet usage, since it was applied relentlessly to describe every action of the Red Army, including ones where the people in question did not believe that they were being “liberated,” as in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. This is the word now used by Russians to describe their invasion of Ukraine, and it carries with it decades of mendacious use. To Ukrainians it can sound both absurd and sinister; when Russians use it earnestly, Ukrainians might consider it a sign of “zombification,” зомбування, a word they use rather a lot. One Ukrainian explanation for the use of the letter Z by official Russia as the symbol of the invasion is that “the other half of the swastika was stolen in the warehouse,” a joke about the logistics of the Russian Army — but personally, the Z makes me think of “zombie.”ImageWindows in Moscow forming the letter Z — the symbol of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine — in March.Credit...Getty ImagesAt present, Ukrainian media often features a special kind of mockery in quotations of Russians speaking Russian — a kind of humor that is only possible from inside a linguistic community. Ukrainians are perfectly capable of writing Russian correctly, but during the war some internet commentators have spelled the occasional Russian word using the Ukrainian writing system, leaving it looking unmoored and pitiable. Writing in Ukrainian, you might spell “oсвобождение” as “aсвобaждениe,” the way it is pronounced — a bit of lexicographic alchemy that makes it (and, by extension, Russians) look silly, and mocks the political concepts being used to justify a war. In a larger sense, such efforts are a means of displacing Russia from its central position in regional culture. Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Indeed, one relevant case of this o/a shift is the name of Russia itself. The Russian word for “Russia” is “Россия,” but that “o” is pronounced as an “a,” something like “Rahssiya.” You can now see where this is going. The “rah” sound at the beginning of our new Ukrainian word, “рашизм,” doesn’t just signal “Russian” — it suggests the word “Russia” as it is pronounced by people speaking Russian. It is the peculiar way Russian speakers name their own country that seals a link between “Russia” and “fascism.”In Russian you need to know when an “o” becomes an “a,” but once you know, the sound is consistent. Ukrainians play with English as well, which in this respect is trickier. In English it is all but impossible to predict how a given vowel will be pronounced; the letter on the page has almost nothing to do with the sound you are supposed to make. (If you don’t believe me, go back and sound out the vowels in any sentence of this essay.) English vowel sounds are also different — broader, lazier and more numerous — than those in Ukrainian and Russian. English speakers have about as many ways of pronouncing “a” as there are vowels in those entire languages.When Americans say “Russia,” the first and second syllable rhyme. This is baffling, since the first vowel is a “u” and the second is an “ia.” Neither is pronounced in a way that corresponds to how speakers of Slavic languages — and indeed most other languages — would understand the pronunciation of “ia” or “u,” or for that matter any vowel. For both, Americans tend to make an “uh” sound, known as a schwa; we say “Ruhshuh.” This “uh” sound does not exist in Ukrainian or Russian, whose speakers sometimes have a difficult time knowing where it belongs and how to pronounce it. It matters how we spell and say “Russia” in English because the Ukrainian word “рашизм” strips the English for parts. Ukrainians hear us say “Russia” a good deal. Now, they tend not to take too seriously what we say about Russia, and generally they are right — and so when they take “Russia” and make it “Pаша,” borrowing the way we might say it, they mean a Russia that is not to be taken so seriously, not to be accepted on its own terms, an object of contempt. This and the more dismissive “Pашkа” (the “k” makes it diminutive) are in the spoken language rather than written. And the way the word is spoken matters, too: the Ukrainians can’t quite do the schwa “uh” sound, so their “Pаша,” although it is meant to mimic English, actually sounds like “Rahsha.” Here we begin to feel the density of the parts and references packed into “рашизм.” It is not just the “r” sound at the beginning that can stand for Russia. Nor is it even just the “ra,” as a reference to how Russian speakers pronounce the Russian word for “Russia.” The first three letters, “раш,” also make reference to how English speakers pronounce Russia. Although the reference to English is inexact, the “rahsh” sound that comes from it turns out to be very productive, because it makes the combination with “fascism” work smoothly. Three-quarters of the letters in a Ukrainian neologism from English (“Pаша”) are brought together with five-sixths of the letters from an adopted Italian word (“фашизм,” fascism) to generate the new word “рашизм” — a dense and effective conglomerate.When we say “Russia,” the double “s” is pronounced “sh.” In the middle of “fascism” we find the same sound, “sh” — though this time it is generated by “sc,” which English borrows from the original Italian “fascismo.” We can render that sound with “sh” or, in these two words, “ss” and “sc,” but the clarifyingly simple Ukrainian orthography picks up that sound, however it is spelled in whatever language, and renders it as “ш.” So “раша” + “фашизм” = “рашизм,” also thanks to that middle sound. The “sh” sound in the middle, the “ш,” refers to both Russia and to fascism, but only because Ukrainians are playing with English. In neither Russian nor Ukrainian does the word for “Russian” have a “sh” sound.“Pашизм” relies on English to work, but it is not easy for English to reclaim. When “Russia” becomes “Pаша,” the vowels firm up and become more honest; they no longer quite conform to English. The same is even true for the “ism,” which in Ukrainian requires a more clipped and disciplined sound. These honest vowels make it hard for English speakers to pronounce “pашизм” as it is supposed to be pronounced — and even if we were to pronounce it correctly in Ukrainian, it would not sound like much of anything in English. Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.This is why, to claim “pашизм” for English, I have to transliterate it — as Ukrainians also generally do — as “ruscism.” The mechanically correct transcription would be “rashysm,” which is hardly clear. We have to go back and get the “u” to indicate Russia, and we take the “ism” because we know this is about ideology. And while the Ukrainian consonant “ш” demands a “sh,” the resulting “rushism” would suggest a weakness for American talk radio or Canadian classic rock. We know that “ш” did not actually come from an “sh” in the first place; it came from both the “ss” of Russia and the “sc” of fascism. We choose “sc,” and get “ruscism.” As in Ukrainian, a “sh” sound joins the two parts. But now, in English, the visible “sc” recalls the unusual spelling of fascism, as it should. In English, if you believe in racism, you are a racist; if you believe in fascism, you are a fascist. This lexical progression is similar in Ukrainian. “Расизм,” racism, has the associated personal form “расист,” racist. “Фашизм,” fascism, yields “фашист,” fascist. Likewise, the new word “рашизм” has “рашист,” or ruscist. (Unlike English, Ukrainian also generates female forms of these words.) Ukrainians sometimes refer to individual Russians as “ruscists,” making lists, for example, of prominent Russian supporters of the war. But there is also the tendency to refer to all Russian soldiers in Ukraine as “ruscists.” This runs into certain difficulties: Given the imperial character of the Russian state, a very high proportion of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine belong to national minorities. This suggests a deeper problem, which is that even soldiers dying for a fascist cause need not be fascists themselves. Whereas Russian leaders have intensified the Soviet tradition of referring to contemporary enemies as “fascists,” in Ukraine, the word refers more simply to the horrors of World War II, which were even deeper there than in Russia. When Ukrainians speak of “ruscism,” they are accusing Russians of a deep betrayal of what should have been a common inheritance and a common memory. They are accusing Russians of becoming what should have been defeated long ago.Few beyond Ukraine seem to know that millions of Ukrainians, exercising freedom of speech in a country that allows it, have invented and are deploying a new word. “Ruscism” will sound strange at first. So did “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing,” other words that emerged from (Eastern) European wars. The concepts that clarify our world today were once strange and new. But when they point to something, they can take hold. Russian fascism is certainly a phenomenon that requires a concept. The Russian Federation promotes the extreme right everywhere. Putin is the idol of white supremacists around the world. Prominent Russian fascists are given access to mass media during wars, including this one. Members of the Russian elite, above all Putin himself, rely increasingly on fascist concepts. Putin’s very justification of the war in Ukraine, as an act of cleansing violence that will return Russia to itself, represents a Christian form of fascism. The recent publication, in an official Russian news service, of what I consider an openly genocidal handbook, providing a plan for the elimination of the Ukrainian nation as such, confirms all this. Moscow is the center of fascism in our world. The greatest risk of such an effectively compact word is that it will carry the sense that all Russians are fascists, simply by virtue of being Russian. Given that half the Ukrainian population is either displaced or trapped by war, with thousands of civilians killed and hundreds of thousands deported, a tendency toward general condemnation is not surprising; the fact that Ukrainians have had a very hard time convincing Russians that a war is actually taking place doesn’t help. But a usage that identifies all Russians as fascists would repeat the error it is meant to rectify. Thus far, the word is generally used as a response to particular actions, like kidnapping children or executing civilians.The word is not only a condemnation of Russian actions; it is also an offering to the Russian language. The words “ruscist” and “ruscism” already flourish in Russian, or at least in Ukrainian Russian. I actually heard them for the first time in Russian, not in Ukrainian. It will be interesting to see if they catch on inside the Russian Federation. If they did, they would most likely be criminalized by the Russian state. Russia today is a country where it is illegal to call this war a “war,” and where reading a poem or showing a blank poster is deemed a slander of the army. Given Putin’s felt need to define the enemy of the moment as fascist, a word that points to Russian fascism is unlikely to be tolerated.ImagePolice officers in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, arresting a demonstrator for protesting with a blank sign in March.Credit...Screen grab from TwitterAnd so we see a difference between official Russia and unofficial Ukraine, one that is not about myths or ethnicity or even language preferences, exactly, but rather about how words matter in wartime, under pressure. In the tyranny, they threaten, because they might reveal truth; in the democracy, they conceptualize and suggest action. This difference is visible on the battlefield, where the Russian Army is conformist and cowering, and the outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian Army adaptable and creative. We also see a difference between Ukrainians and monolingual people generally. There is a liveliness inherent in Ukrainian code-switching that makes constructing the word “рашизм” possible — and once constructed, the word has a liveliness of its own. We can appreciate Ukrainian creativity, and perhaps borrow from it.That “ruscism” is used to describe the enemy has implications for how Ukrainians define their own values. It stigmatizes Russia as an invader committing an injustice that can be linked to past injustices, and whose leaders abuse language to hide these basic facts. But it also takes as axiomatic (and thus affirms) that fascism is what is to be resisted. The language has supplied a new thing, and, as Hannah Arendt reminds us, new things are the best we can hope for in totalitarian times. The Ukrainian language has offered a neologism whose formation helps us to see deeper into the creativity of another culture, and whose meaning helps us to see why this war is fought — and why it must be won.Timothy Snyder is the Levin professor of history at Yale University.

22,"This past week, as Ukrainian forces retook the town of Bucha to find its streets littered with the bodies of bound and shot civilians, and as rockets rained on a train station packed with fleeing families, killing dozens, two words were on the lips of diplomats, world leaders and rights groups: war crimes.But as investigators comb Ukraine for evidence, which could be used to bring charges, an uncomfortable fact hangs over their work.Members of sitting governments and their militaries, no matter how horrifying the evidence against them, virtually never face international prosecution for their country’s conduct in war.There have been many successful war crimes trials since the foundations of such proceedings were laid at the end of World War II. But look closely and a pattern emerges that is not encouraging to hopes that the perpetrators in this war will be similarly held to account.In practice, justice for war crimes has been applied by conquerors, as in postwar Germany or American-occupied Iraq; by victors in civil war, as in Rwanda or Ivory Coast; or by a new government overthrowing an old one, as in Serbia or Sierra Leone.Champions of international law argue that the International Criminal Court and similar bodies apply rulings dispassionately and transparently. Trials typically stretch on for years and sometimes end in acquittals: It is hardly brute victor’s justice.Still, the fact remains that perpetrators almost never arrive in the dock unless they are delivered there by the victors in a war or power struggle that has deposed them.This means that as long as a government remains in power, any war crimes charges against it, however well proven, are likely be little more than symbolic. If those in power act as if they are immune to the laws of war, it is because, in practice, they often are.This problem has long bedeviled the world’s efforts to police war, with atrocities going largely unpunished in Syria, Myanmar and many other conflicts where the accused remain in power.Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has expressed frustration at these limitations, telling the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that it might as well “dissolve yourself all together.”Urging the Council to establish a tribunal for possible Russian war crimes, he said of the body’s failure to hold Moscow accountable, “Do you think that the time of international law is gone?”Maybe so, or maybe it has not yet quite arrived.Justice for SomeImageThe prosecution of Nazi officials during the Nuremberg Trials of 1945 helped establish international rules for war. Credit...The New York TimesThe limits of international justice stretch back even to the Nuremberg tribunals, set up in Germany after World War II, and which became a basis for the international rules of war.The tribunal was meant to establish that conduct in war can be punished as a crime, but would be done so under principles of due process and impartiality.Ever since, global treaties and a body of international law have forbade deliberate attacks on civilians or population centers, among other acts, including torture and genocide. Still, Nuremberg’s tribunal only considered atrocities by the vanquished Nazis. Conduct by the victorious allies was left to those countries’ own judicial systems, which, unsurprisingly, faulted some individual soldiers but not their governments.This model has largely held ever since.When Rwanda’s civil war toppled its government, widely accused of genocide, it may have been the United Nations that set up a tribunal, but it was the new Rwandan government that decided who was handed over. It was mostly the defeated who stood trial.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia’s wartime leader, faced trial in The Hague only after opposition leaders deposed and extradited him. Milosevic, off Serbian soil, would be out of the picture. And outsourcing his punishment would keep the oppositions’ hands clean.The International Criminal Court, or I.C.C., the pre-eminent body for prosecuting war crimes, has indicted about 40 people. All are from Africa. Many are leaders or rebels who lost a war or power struggle. Many, like Milosevic, were shipped over by those who’d deposed them.While the court’s rulings are considered credible, it is perceived at times as rubber-stamp for the outcome of a civil war or power struggle by helping the victors banish their opponents to a faraway prison.The reach of such courts and tribunals is often restricted by the countries in which they were called to investigate. The courts had access to Rwanda, Bosnia and Cambodia because those countries’ governments wanted them to.In 2010, the I.C.C. opened an investigation into election violence that had killed over 1,000 people in Kenya, later naming the politician Uhuru Kenyatta and others as suspected instigators. But it dropped the case after Mr. Kenyatta became the country’s president, saying it had no way to proceed.Mr. Kenyatta, before his case was dropped, even traveled to The Hague to sit before the court investigating him, dismissing the I.C.C. as a “toy of declining imperial powers.”Serving Justice or Power?ImageOmar al-Bashir, the former president of Sudan, on trial for corruption in Khartoum in 2019.

Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.This is what happened to Sudan’s longtime leader, Omar al-Bashir, for whom the I.C.C. issued arrest warrants in 2009 and 2010 for war crimes. This effectively barred Mr. Bashir from visiting countries that had signaled they would comply with the warrant.Still, this travel ban — like so much of international law — was ultimately subject to the whims of national governments. Dozens of countries that wished to host Mr. Bashir continued to do so freely. Those that barred his entry now had a legal justification, though many had previously placed him under sanctions that had the same effect.The world’s major powers have consistently resisted the ability of international courts to hold them or their allies accountable, even symbolically. The United States, Russia, China and India all reject the I.C.C.’s jurisdiction.In 2002, a few months into the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, Congress passed a law requiring that the United States cut off aid to any country that would not agree to never send an American to the court.International justice officials have, in recent years, sought ways to investigate governments still in power.In 2016, the I.C.C. opened an investigation into possible war crimes committed during Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia. Unable to gain access to territory that remains occupied by Russia, the court’s investigation has been limited. Prosecutors requested their first arrest warrants only last month, naming three individuals in Russian-held territory. None are expected to face arrest.In 2020, the I.C.C. launched an inquiry into American conduct in Afghanistan. In response, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and travel bans against some I.C.C. officials, though the Biden administration reversed this.Last year, the I.C.C. announced it would, after a decade of Palestinian lobbying, investigate possible war crimes in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. Israeli officials are expected to bar the investigators from entering.Symbolic JusticeImageThe International Criminal Court in The Hague. The court has only ever tried Africans. Credit...Peter Dejong/Associated PressStill, even when perpetrators are beyond reach, international courts can have a role to play.For one, proving out crimes in absentia, under the auspices of an independent legal process, can help to establish what happened.After a commercial airliner was shot down over separatist-held eastern Ukraine in 2014, an international investigation accused four people, three with ties to Russian intelligence, of responsibility. Some legal scholars have called for a similar approach in the current war.Proof of responsibility, or the word of a trusted international court, can also be useful as tools of statecraft. Mr. Zelensky could use such charges to keep pressure on Western governments for military support or to lobby fence-sitters like India.Such cases can also prove restorative for victims to see their suffering acknowledged.The I.C.C. investigation in Georgia collected testimony from 6,000 witnesses, most in communities that felt the world had forgotten them. It also led to the creation of a fund, financed by donations from foreign governments, that provides medical care, counseling and financial support for families displaced by the war.Still, with a few hundred thousand euros to spread among thousands of victims, and no power to punish Russian perpetrators, it is hardly the vision of justice conjured by references to Nuremberg, which Mr. Zelensky has urged as a model.“We have heard about the I.C.C.,” Tina Nebieridze, a 73-year-old survivor of Russia’s invasion of Georgia, told Justice Info, a Swiss-based development site, last year.“For 12 years they’ve been laughing at us, the government as well as the others in Strasbourg or The Hague,” Ms. Nebieridze said. Relocated to a crumbling apartment building far from her home, now under more than a decade of Russian occupation, she was little impressed by promises of coming assistance. “I no longer have any hope in justice.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-crimes.html

Oleksandr Gorvat presented his girlfriend and commanding officer, First Lt. Olena Petyak, a ring he had twisted together from wire and asked for her hand in marriage.“Officially we’re not supposed to serve together, but we are not officially married,” he explained on Friday, amid the whoosh of Grad rockets being fired at nearby Russian positions. “That is for after the war. As soon as we win.”Together with their unit, the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, the couple, both 25, were dug into a frontline position in the Zaporizka region of south-central Ukraine, east of the Dnipro River and only about two miles from where Russian forces were attempting to overrun more territory.Fierce fighting was underway on Friday across a band of southeastern Ukraine, in and around major towns like Polohy, Orikhiv and Vasylivka, which is on the banks of the Dnipro. It fell to the troops of the 128th to prevent Russian forces from pushing farther north toward the important industrial city of Zaporizhzhia, just 20 miles north of Vasylivka on the river.The Kremlin has achieved one of its strategic goals, seizing a strip of land along the Azov Sea, linking the Donbas region in the east, now the focus of the war, with Crimea, the peninsula President Vladimir V. Putin invaded and annexed in 2014. The only significant pocket of resistance remaining is a sprawling steel mill complex in the ruined port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters and civilians are in underground bunkers, under heavy bombardment.Video{""@context"":""http://schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""@id"":""https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000008293410/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-war.html"",""description"":""Our cameras captured life on the front lines in southeast Ukraine, where Russian shelling is relentless and it feels like the war is inching closer every day."",""url"":""https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000008293410/zaporizhzhia-ukraine-war.html"",""name"":""As Russia Pivots East, Ukrainians Ask: Are We Next?"",""thumbnailUrl"":[""https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/09/world/europe/99871/99871-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg"",""https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/09/world/europe/99871/99871-superJumbo.jpg"",""https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/09/world/europe/99871/99871-square640.jpg""],""embedUrl"":""https://www.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000008293410"",""uploadDate"":""2022-04-16T09:00:04.000Z"",""duration"":""PT8M37.225S""}Our cameras captured life on the front lines in southeast Ukraine, where Russian shelling is relentless and it feels like the war is inching closer every day.CreditCredit...By Yousur Al-Hlou, Masha Froliak, Mark Boyer and Benjamin FoleyBut the Russians were attempting this week to expand that ribbon of territory, pushing north from the coast toward Zaporizhzhia. Other Russian forces were pushing west through Donbas, where on Friday some of the heaviest combat was being waged around the city of Sievierodonetsk and the town of Popasna. Moscow’s army was also advancing southward from the city of Izium. Altogether, the front line is about 300 miles long.Moscow’s separatist proxies in Donbas, backed by Russian equipment and troops, have held part of the region since 2014, and Russia has said that it aims to expand its territory there. How far Mr. Putin will go is unclear, but the Kremlin appears intent on trapping much of the Ukrainian military in a pincer and destroying it.Lieutenant Petyak, who is second in command of the brigade, said the goal in the Zaporizhzhia region — the southwestern part of that front line — was not just to hold the Russians at a standstill but to push them back.“The enemy is constantly firing with artillery, tanks, Grads, and aviation in our direction,” she said. “They want to knock out this section, but they won’t be able to do it because we’re here. On the contrary they are going to have to give up their positions because I’m certain that sometime soon we will push forward and take the remainder of the land that they’ve been able to temporarily occupy.”ImageIt fell to the troops of the 128th to prevent Russian forces from pushing farther north toward the important industrial city of Zaporizhzhia.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesThat may prove a challenge, even for the Ukrainian forces, which have surprised military analysts and professional soldiers with their fierce and effective defense since the start of the war.After Mr. Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces based in the Crimean Peninsula, some of the country’s most skilled and well-equipped, lunged north, gobbling up territory in southern Ukraine both in the direction of Kherson, west of the Dnipro, and east toward Mariupol.Early in the morning of Feb. 24, the soldiers of the 128th brigade learned the war had begun when a Russian cruise missile hit their base, just missing the barracks where they slept. The troops were able to escape into the nearby woods.It was the next day, as they scrambled to regroup and join the combat against the invading Russians, that Sergeant Gorvat proposed.At first the brigade was deployed in the vicinity of Melitopol, a southern city about midway between Crimea and Zaporizhzhia. But they have been pushed back nearly 70 miles to the north. They are now entrenched in a patch of woods wedged between wheat fields that are bright green with spring growth.Ukrainians who live in the coastal territory that Russia has seized continue to surge north seeking refuge in Ukrainian-held lands. Convoys of cars and buses, laden with suitcases, arrive regularly at the parking lot of a home goods store in Zaporizhzhia. Many arrive with unsettling tales of the Russian occupation.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

25,"BUCHA, Ukraine — The Russian forces that were intent on overwhelming Kyiv at the war’s start with tanks and artillery retreated under fire across a broad front on Saturday, leaving behind them dead soldiers and burned vehicles, according to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts.The withdrawal suggested the possibility of a major turn in the six-week war — the collapse, at least for now, of Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and the end of its hopes for the quick subjugation of the nation.Moscow has described the withdrawal as a tactical move to regroup and reposition its forces for a major push in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. While there are early indications that the military is following through on that plan, analysts say it cannot obscure the magnitude of the defeat.“The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals — the capture of Kyiv — proved unobtainable for Russian forces,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview Saturday.Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian attacks continued unabated, and the Pentagon has cautioned that the formations near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.In the south, an aid convoy organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross that had stalled on its way to bring some relief to the besieged city of Mariupol was on the move again. The hope, repeatedly frustrated by Russian shelling, was to bring emergency supplies to trapped residents and to evacuate hundreds of those who have endured weeks of bombardment that has left shortages of food and water.In the suburban towns north of Kyiv, the Ukrainian army was advancing through a tableau of destruction, with dozens of wrecked tanks on streets, extensive damage to buildings and the bodies of civilians still lying uncollected. Kyiv and its surroundings, which had echoed with artillery booms and gunfire for weeks, had gone quiet.ImageUkrainian soldiers from the Azov Battalion near the remnants of a Russian military convoy in the recently liberated town of Bucha on Saturday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesUkraine’s military on Saturday moved into Bucha, a key town on the west bank of the Dnipro River — which divides Kyiv — days after Russian forces had sacked it on their way out.“They went from apartment to apartment collecting televisions and computers, loaded them on their tanks and left,” Svetlana Semenova, a retiree, said of the Russian departure, which she described as chaotic. “They left in a hurry.”A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back. The New York Times was unable to independently verify Mr. Podolyak’s claim the people had been executed.ImageResidents of Bucha walk past the body of a civilian left in the street on Saturday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesThe town was the site of a major Ukrainian ambush of a Russian armored column in the first days of the war, and one street was blocked by dozens of incinerated tanks and trucks.Despite that setback, the Russians had captured Bucha and held it for about a month. They executed half a dozen members of the Territorial Defense Force — the volunteer army many Ukrainians joined when the war started — leaving the bodies in a heavily mined part of town, said Varvara Kaminskaya, 69.The Ukrainians have advanced at least another 15 miles to the northwest of Bucha, where they now fly Ukrainian flags over former Russian checkpoints. After their initial assault on the capital failed, the Russian army had dug into defensive positions outside of Kyiv, suggesting an intention to hold a front line near the city. In an artillery war, trenches afford soldiers the best chance of survival.Those were abandoned in and around Bucha on Saturday. On the northern edge of town were the abandoned berms that had sheltered Russian artillery emplacements, surrounded by green boxes and hundreds of empty shell cases.“According to our information, they are running away from all areas around Kyiv,” said Sgt. Ihor Zaichuk, the commander of the 1st company of the 2nd Azov battalion in the Ukrainian army, which fought in Bucha.“They can say on their own television stations, if they want, that they are the second most powerful army in the world,” he said. “But they aren’t anymore.”He cautioned, however, that the Russians might return. “Only their commanders know if they will be re-equipped and return.” Even as cars lined up on some roads, making their way back into Kyiv, workers were building new defenses from heavy logs.On the east bank of the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces were pressing forward in villages dozens of miles from the capital, according to an intelligence officer with the S.B.U., the Ukrainian domestic intelligence service, who declined to be identified for security reasons.Analysts said that Moscow’s stated decision to refocus its military on the Donbas in eastern Ukraine is likely to be accurate, but mostly because they had little option.“The Russians are adjusting their goals to reality,” Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said in an interview on Saturday. “I think they know they’re in trouble, so I don’t think it’s a ruse to say they’re concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Mr. Kofman, the expert on the Russian military, said the Russian army had lost about 2,000 pieces of equipment that was either destroyed, captured or abandoned, including about 350 tanks.As the Russians retreated, they left mines and booby traps behind in an effort to slow the Ukrainians’ pursuit, according to Ukrainian officers in different towns. In the suburb of Irpin, which the Ukrainians had recaptured before Bucha, demining operations were in full swing on Saturday. Some civilian bodies had been booby-trapped to kill emergency workers, Ukrainian officials said.One group of military engineers, dressed in heavy blue Kevlar armor, had tied a rope to a body. They pulled on it, to see if the motion would trigger booby traps. By late in the day, however, the body remained there, with the engineers apparently unable to ascertain if it was safe to collect.In the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital, there were signs of a hasty Russian retreat from a scene of carnage. On a forest road leading out of the village, nine tanks and armored vehicles lay destroyed and gutted by fire, the detritus of a tank battle three days earlier. The turrets and heavy guns of two tanks lay tossed aside. Inside one armored personnel carrier, the burned human remains of men were visible.ImageBurned-out remains of Russian armored vehicles littered a forest road near Dmytrivka on Saturday.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesValentina Yatsevich, 58, a villager walking past the wrecks toward her home, said, “They did not leave, they were destroyed.”In Russia itself, the retreat caused consternation among the war’s cheerleaders, with state television having previously raised expectations that the Russian military would capture Kyiv.Semyon Pegov, a popular pro-Kremlin war blogger embedded with the Russian troops, posted a video to the social messaging app Telegram on Saturday describing the move as “a withdrawal, not a flight.”The retreat was necessitated, he said, by Russia’s stretched-out supply lines and the threat of further losses as its troops tried to survive in field conditions facing a much better supplied and fortified enemy.It was an effort, mirrored by other pro-Kremlin outlets, to explain why Russia seemed to have sharply scaled back its war aims in recent days, after taking painful losses in fighting for the Kyiv suburbs.Russian hard-liners calling for an assault on Kyiv saw the retreat as a disappointment. “I don’t know why this decision was made,” Aleksandr Kots, a war correspondent for the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, wrote on Telegram. “The war is only beginning. We’ll figure out later who was right and who was at fault.”ImageResidents of the recently liberated town of Bucha reach for food being distributed by Ukrainian soldiers with the Azov battalion on Saturday.

He expressed confidence that European countries would renew relations with Russia once they “sober up a little from the American bourbon.”In Lithuania, President Gitanas Nauseda announced that his country would no longer import Russian gas starting this month. “If we can do it, the rest of Europe can do it too,” he wrote on Twitter. The European Union is looking for ways to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas.In other developments on Saturday, Pope Francis, visiting the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, edged closer to blaming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for the war in Ukraine than he had before. In an address to Maltese dignitaries and officials, the pope blamed a “potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests” for casting “dark shadows of war” from Europe’s east.Francis has declined to explicitly blame Mr. Putin or Russia as the aggressor for various reasons, including the Vatican’s hopes of playing a role in a potential peace agreement. But on Saturday, he clearly seemed to be speaking about Mr. Putin, who he said was “provoking and fomenting conflicts.”ImageRussian forces retreated from Irpin, a strategic town just 12 miles outside of Kyiv, after weeks of heavy fighting and ceaseless bombardment.

29,"His name had surfaced as an influential figure in Ukraine with potential inside knowledge of Russian electoral meddling in the United States, though for years he had steadfastly denied it.But in recent days, the ground has shifted dramatically under Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian politician who is a close confidant of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and who had also been a client of the Republican political consultant Paul J. Manafort.Mr. Medvedchuk went into hiding early in the war, Ukrainian officials say, and was detained this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Tuesday a picture on Telegram of the politician, looking tired and disheveled, wearing handcuffs. He was arrested after violating terms of his house arrest while awaiting trial for treason, in a case opened last year.That case is related to coal trading with pro-Russian separatists, but more broadly it has to do with the swirl of financial and political intrigue surrounding Moscow’s operations to influence politics in foreign countries.For now, it’s unclear whether Mr. Medvedchuk will ever testify in court in Ukraine or be interviewed by investigators looking into Russian influence operations elsewhere. Mr. Zelensky said he would seek to trade Mr. Medvedchuk to Russia for Ukrainian prisoners of war.“I offer the Russian Federation to trade your man for our boys and girls now in captivity,” Mr. Zelensky said. “It’s important our law enforcement and military study such a possibility.”A trade would presumably put Mr. Medvedchuk in Russia, out of reach of researchers tracking Russian attempts to influence political outcomes abroad, in which Mr. Medvedchuk is said to have played a central role in Ukraine.ImageA photo released by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office Tuesday shows Viktor Medvedchuk in handcuffs after he was detained.Credit...Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, via Associated PressHis relevance to Russian electoral meddling in the United States related to his ties to Mr. Manafort, and he was not described as playing a central role in a special prosecutor’s report or in two federal trials of Mr. Manafort.Still, Mr. Medvedchuk has been close both politically and personally to Mr. Putin for more than two decades, and he was a prominent figure in the pro-Russian wing of Ukrainian politics, a circle where Mr. Manafort found several clients.Mr. Putin is the godfather to Mr. Medvedchuk’s daughter. The two men met frequently over the years, and Russian air traffic control authorities granted special exemptions for Mr. Medvedchuk’s private jet on flights to Moscow, he said in an interview in 2017.Some European politicians, including the former chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, had publicly endorsed a role for Mr. Medvedchuk as an intermediary in the standoff between Russia and Ukraine, given his personal ties to Mr. Putin.But in Ukraine, outside of a narrow base of support mostly in the country’s east, he was widely viewed as a loathsome quisling who had reaped wealth from energy deals with the Kremlin while promoting Russian foreign policy goals, including weakening the central government under a federalization overhaul that he had championed for years.At various times, he had served as deputy speaker of Parliament, a presidential adviser and a negotiator in prisoner exchanges with Russia. And as a figure at the nexus of various financial and political influence operations run by the Kremlin, Mr. Medvedchuk’s importance extended beyond Ukraine.Mr. Manafort, before he became chairman of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016, worked for a decade as a consultant for Russian-leaning politicians in Ukraine, including the Opposition Bloc party, in which Mr. Medvedchuk was one of three leading figures.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

He recalled a party conference that the American consultant had attended ahead of parliamentary elections a few years earlier. Mr. Manafort, he said, had endorsed the party’s pro-Russia policies as electorally sound in Ukraine’s southeastern region.“The principles, including those Paul Manafort presented, said we should stick to positions we held on economic integration with Russia,” he said. He added that Mr. Manafort had “supported these ideas” to win votes in Russian-speaking areas where the Opposition Bloc was popular.Mr. Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign in August 2016, after the Ukrainian authorities released entries from an accounting document showing he had received $12.7 million from pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine under a payment scheme under investigation for possibly being illegal.ImageIn a photo released by Russian state media Viktor Medvedchuk, left, speaks to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in Moscow in 2020.Credit...Pool photo by SputnikAs the investigation into Russian meddling ramped up in the United States in 2017, Mr. Medvedchuk’s name surfaced as one of several pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians close to both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Putin. That year, Reuters reported that F.B.I. investigators were examining 18 phone calls and text messages between people close to Mr. Trump and people with ties to Mr. Putin, including Mr. Medvedchuk.At the time, Mr. Medvedchuk denied wrongdoing. It is unclear whether any potential criminal prosecution now in Ukraine — if he is not traded in a prisoner swap — would touch on these issues or focus only on his role in Ukrainian politics.Mr. Medvedchuk never downplayed what he described as a “personal” relationship of friendship with Mr. Putin, despite the two countries being in a military conflict since 2014. In the interview, he said that in 2004 he had asked Mr. Putin to become the godfather of his daughter and that Mr. Putin “with pleasure agreed.”After his capture, Mr. Zelensky posted a photograph on Telegram showing Mr. Medvedchuk in handcuffs and wearing a Ukrainian military uniform. Mr. Zelensky said he had tried to disguise himself as a soldier and for this reason would be subject to military law and could be offered in exchange for Ukrainian prisoners of war.The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, offered no immediate response to the arrest of the father of Mr. Putin’s goddaughter, saying he could not confirm that Mr. Medvedchuk had been detained, according to Russian state media.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/viktor-medvedchuk-russia-ukraine.html
30,"WASHINGTON — When Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on top American officials last month, its government targeted President Biden and his top national security advisers, along with Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, whose agency has been crafting the punitive measures aimed at crippling Russia’s economy.Russia’s move, while wholly symbolic, underscored the central role that the Treasury Department has been playing in designing and enforcing the most expansive financial restrictions that the United States has ever imposed on a major economic power.Those restrictions amount to an economic war against Russia, which is entering a critical phase as the toll of fighting in Ukraine continues to escalate and as the Russian government tries to find ways to evade or mitigate fallout from Western sanctions.In an attempt to prevent Russia from skirting the penalties, Mr. Adeyemo, a 40-year-old former Obama administration official, spent last week crisscrossing Europe to coordinate a crackdown on Russia’s evasion tactics and to plot future sanctions. In meetings with counterparts, Mr. Adeyemo discussed plans by European governments to target the supply chains of Russian defense companies, some of which the U.S. placed under sanctions last week, and he talked about ways the United States could help provide more energy to Europe so European countries could scale back purchases of Russian oil and gas, a Treasury official said.On Wednesday, five days after Mr. Adeyemo returned, the Biden administration announced additional sanctions on Russian banks, state-owned enterprises and the adult daughters of President Vladimir V. Putin.Still, it remains to be seen whether the sweeping penalties aimed at neutering Russia’s economic power are working.Over the past six weeks, the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia have imposed sanctions on large financial institutions in Russia, its central bank, its military-industrial supply chain and Mr. Putin’s allies, seizing their yachts and planes. Imports of Russian oil to the United States have been banned, and Europe is developing plans to wean itself off Russian gas and coal, albeit slowly. This week, the Treasury Department prohibited Russia from making sovereign debt payments with dollars held at American banks, potentially pushing Russia toward its first foreign currency debt default in a century.But thus far Russia has kept paying its debts. Currency controls imposed by Mr. Putin’s central bank, which restricted Russians from using rubles to buy dollars or other hard currencies, along with continuing energy exports to Europe and elsewhere have allowed the ruble to stabilize and are replenishing Russia’s coffers with more dollars and euros. That has raised questions about whether the measures have been effective.“I think we’re grappling with the aftershocks of the shock and awe of the sanctions that were put in place and the recognition that sanctions take time to fully impact an economy,” said Juan C. Zarate, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for terrorist financing and financial crimes. “It’s asking too much of sanctions to actually turn back the tanks, especially when sanctions have been implemented after the invasion.”At a speech in London last week, Mr. Adeyemo promoted the ability of sanctions to change behavior, describing the measures as a part of the equation that adversaries such as Russia need to consider when they violate international norms.“The idea that you can violate the sovereignty of another country and enjoy the privileges of integration into the global economy is one our allies and partners will not tolerate,” Mr. Adeyemo said at Chatham House, a think tank.Yet even the United States, which is not reliant on Russian energy, has wrestled with how far to go with its penalties.Within the Treasury Department, officials have been in a debate about how far to push the sanctions without creating unintended consequences that would rattle the financial system and inflame inflation, which is soaring across much of the world.The impact on the U.S. economy has been a top priority, and Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, has expressed concern about measures that would amplify inflation. The sanctions on Russia have already led to higher prices for gasoline, and officials are wary that they could bring spikes in food and car prices as Russian wheat and mineral exports are disrupted.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.“Our goal from the outset has been to impose maximum pain on Russia, while to the best of our ability shielding the United States and our partners from undue economic harm,” Ms. Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday.As officials considered how to target the ruble, Ms. Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, argued against just imposing a ban on foreign exchange transactions, which would prevent Russia from buying dollars. She suggested instead that immobilizing Russia’s foreign reserves — savings that are held in U.S. dollars, euros and other liquid assets — while creating exemptions for Russia to accept payment for certain energy transactions would be the most effective way to inflict pain on Russia’s economy while minimizing the impact on the United States and its allies.At a congressional hearing this week, Republicans criticized those carve-outs for being giant loopholes that allow Russia to earn hundreds of millions of dollars per day through oil and gas sales.Treasury Department officials have been tracking measures that Russia has been using to prop up its economy, such as buying stocks and bonds, and monitoring signs of a growing black market for rubles, which indicates the currency’s actual diminished value. The Biden administration has watched with concern as the value of the ruble has rebounded in recent weeks, undercutting pronouncements made by Mr. Biden that sanctions reduced the Russian currency to “rubble.”“Of course that means that, having said that, when the ruble rebounds for reasons that do not necessarily indicate weakness of sanctions, people will say, ‘Well, see, they failed,’” said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland and assistant secretary of state for Europe.A Treasury official said the United States was also keeping a private list of oligarchs whose financial transactions were under surveillance in preparation for sanctions so they could gain a better understanding of the networks of people that helped those individuals conceal their money. The United States has yet to impose sanctions on Roman Abramovich, a Russian billionaire who is already subject to European Union sanctions.Economists at the Institute of International Finance wrote in a research note this week that Russia’s domestic markets appeared to be stabilizing as a result of tight monetary policy, severe capital controls and its current account surplus.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Ms. Yellen, an academic economist with no national security experience, tapped him last year to be deputy secretary and to lead a review of the department’s sanctions program.The review emphasized the need for sanctions, which were often deployed unilaterally during the Trump administration, to have tight coordination with American allies so they can “disrupt, deter and prevent” actions that undermine U.S. national security.Mr. Adeyemo has been coordinating closely with officials from the State Department and with Daleep Singh, who was deputy assistant secretary for international affairs at Treasury during the Obama administration and is now deputy national security adviser for international economics.Julia Friedlander, a former senior policy adviser for Europe in Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said the Biden administration had been more aggressive with sanctions on Russia than the nation was in 2014, when there was concern about taking actions that were not “proportional” and that might destabilize Russia’s economy. Russia’s gradual buildup of troops heading toward Ukraine, she said, also gave the Biden administration more time to coordinate with allies and prepare to deploy the sanctions quickly once the invasion began.“It really is a tactical shift between a proportional response against the people involved to wanting to inflict damage as a tactic,” Ms. Friedlander said.But some sanctions experts contend that the Biden administration has not gone far enough. Many of the toughest measures that the United States used against Iran to prevent it from benefiting from energy exports have yet to be used against Russia. Several major banks have yet to be restricted or cut off from SWIFT, the international financial messaging service. And the United States has treaded carefully when it comes to pressuring Europe to stop buying Russian energy.“Time is not on Ukraine’s side,” said Marshall S. Billingslea, who was the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing in the Trump administration. “The longer the administration dribbles these half measures out and doesn’t take steps to really paralyze the Russian economy, the longer the Russian offensive goes and the more carnage and destruction and war crimes continue.”Ms. Yellen said this week that any sanctions targeting Russia’s energy sector would need to be closely coordinated with Europe, which remains heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas. Taking that step, she added, could have unwanted consequences.“We’re likely to see skyrocketing prices if we did put a complete ban on oil,” Ms. Yellen said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/us/politics/russia-sanctions-effectiveness-adeyemo.html
31,"The United States has increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine about Russian forces in the Donbas and Crimea, as Kyiv’s military forces prepare to defend against a renewed offensive by Moscow in the country’s east, American officials said Wednesday.The information could allow the Ukrainians to conduct more effective counterattacks against Russian forces in the Donbas or Crimea, or better predict the movement of Russian troops from those areas against Ukrainian forces.After several weeks of failing to take Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, Russian forces retreated from around the city and have been regrouping in Ukraine’s east, including the Donbas region. Western officials say they expect the Kremlin to mount a major offensive there.As the conflict in Ukraine has evolved, intelligence agencies have adjusted their approach to ensure officials have flexibility “to share detailed timely intelligence with the Ukrainians,” a U.S. intelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the handling of classified material.The United States has adjusted its flow of intelligence since the war began, and administration officials have said they have been giving Ukraine the most relevant information at any given moment. Still, the Biden administration has been reluctant to help the Ukrainians target Russian forces in Russia, and Republican lawmakers said that concern has extended to Russian forces in Crimea and the Donbas.The stepped-up intelligence sharing was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.U.S. officials have defended the intelligence sharing with Ukraine. On Tuesday, Kathleen H. Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, said that “the intelligence support that we have provided has been vital.” And she said the information given to Ukraine had been “high end.”Other officials said that as the Russian military shifted its strategy away from their attack on Kyiv to reinforcing operations in the Donbas, U.S. intelligence agencies began to look at whether their guidance on what information could be shared needed to be expanded, and changed that guidance earlier in April.Republicans have been critical of the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, saying they have failed to provide enough information to Ukraine about Russian forces stationed in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that those forces and Russian-backed separatist groups have occupied since 2014 and 2015.In a letter released on Monday, Senate Republicans said they were concerned that not enough was being done to share critical intelligence with Ukrainians. The letter, from Senator Marco Rubio and others, specifically made reference to providing intelligence with the Ukrainians to help them “retake every inch of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, which includes Crimea and the Donbas.” Russia seized the Black Sea territory of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and armed Russian-backed separatists began claiming parts of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, collectively known as the Donbas.

Austin III, the secretary of defense, about whether the United States was providing enough intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them retake territory in the Donbas occupied in 2015, before the current invasion.“Part of what you’ve heard from both parties in this committee is that as much as we have done, we’re still engaged in too many half measures,” Mr. Cotton said. “There’s still too much hesitancy and tentativeness in our posture toward this war.”Mr. Austin said that the government was updating its intelligence-sharing guidance to make sure intelligence on the Russian-occupied Donbas areas could be provided. “The current guidance was not clear in that regard, so we’ll make sure it’s clear,” Mr. Austin said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/us-russian-troops-donbas-intelligence-sharing-ukraine.html
32,"When European leaders recently pressed China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, to distance himself from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, he doggedly stuck to prepared remarks for the video summit, shutting down any opening for their demands.Speaking from the grandiose Great Hall of the People, he declared that China, as it had for years, welcomed the European Union as a pillar of an emerging multipolar world. But Mr. Xi also made clear that cajoling China about Russia was not the kind of assertiveness that he wanted.Their talks were “open,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, told reporters afterward, before adding: “Open means that we exchanged very clearly opposing views.”The awkward talks epitomized how China is struggling to ride out geopolitical shock waves from the war in Ukraine, and nowhere more so than in its relations with Europe.For Chinese leaders, Europe was supposed to be the softer wing of the Western world, with neither the military power nor the will to contest China’s rise. Now, they risk missing the potentially far-reaching implications of the war, as Europe reassesses its security needs and Beijing’s intentions.In Europe, “the narrative is becoming: This is what you get if you deal nicely with authoritarian regimes,” said Ivana Karásková, a researcher on Chinese foreign policy at Charles University in Prague. “It’s becoming not only about Russia; it’s also about China.”In the longer term, Europe’s new focus on geopolitical risks and its closer ties to the United States could evolve into a more antagonistic stance toward Mr. Xi’s government, especially if Beijing stays close to Russia and shields it from economic sanctions.Shortly before Mr. Xi’s summit with European officials, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that Beijing wanted to take relations with Russia to “a higher level.”ImageResidents of Ukraine waiting to board a bus to leave the country. Since the war started, many European countries are reassessing their security needs and their relationships with China.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesEurope for now is consumed with the crises created by the invasion of Ukraine by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including more than 4.6 million refugees. Many European governments have vowed a drastic upgrade of military spending and preparedness. Politicians in Berlin, Paris and other capitals are already discussing how far their newfound vigilance may extend to China, as well as Russia.“The European line on China has been hardening for five or six years, but I think we are entering a new phase,” Noah Barkin, a Berlin-based analyst for the Rhodium Group who monitors Chinese ties with Europe, said in an interview. “There’s a realization in Europe that China may no longer be a partner, that it may increasingly be seen as a threat.”Chinese officials appear unsure how to respond.For years, Beijing tried to coax Europe closer as a trade and diplomatic partner, and warned against aligning with Washington’s efforts to offset China. Instead, Chinese officials argued, Europe could help cushion the world against American dominance, an especially potent message when the Trump administration disavowed the Paris climate accord and put tariffs on some European goods.Yet even before the war, European disenchantment with Beijing was growing.The European Union members and Britain were becoming increasingly critical of China’s clampdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang; its widening trade surplus with Europe; and its pugnacious diplomacy about Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy that Beijing claims as its own. Last year, the European Parliament blocked an expansive trade agreement with China, citing its record on human rights, as well as its sanctions on European lawmakers and scholars.“Communication on the Chinese side appears stuck to an E.U. that no longer exists,” said Francesca Ghiretti, an analyst on European-Chinese relations at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.“China seems unable to grasp that the more assertive positioning that the E.U. has been developing is not the result of U.S. pressure,” she said. “Now the E.U. and China’s differences are on core issues. The response to Ukraine being a case in point.”For its part, Beijing has been angered by European sanctions over Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and the European Union’s designation in 2019 of China as an emerging “systemic rival” in security, while still a major market for European exporters and a partner against climate change and other global threats.Chinese diplomats maintain that Europe has misconstrued Mr. Xi’s intentions about the war in Ukraine, and that enmity from the United States forced Beijing closer to Russia. Mr. Xi obliquely warned the European Union not to align itself further with Washington’s efforts to counter Chinese power.“We hope that the European side will form its own understanding of China, and adhere to its own autonomous policies toward China,” he told European officials at the summit.ImageThe European Council’s president, Charles Michel, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, after an online summit meeting with Xi Jinping of China in Brussels.Credit...Olivier Hoslet/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Xi’s stick-to-the-script responses on Ukraine may reflect worries that Europe expects too much from Beijing. Beijing needed to do better at explaining that its influence over Mr. Putin is limited and brittle, said Wang Yiwei, the director of the Center for European Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, who sits on a government advisory panel.“If China offended Russia, then nobody would be able to influence it,” Mr. Wang said in an interview. Others, he said, should not regard China “as if it was someone who can just put a phone call through to Putin, and then he’ll stop.”China may yet be able to hold back the European Union from taking a much harder line against Beijing.China and the European Union are each other’s biggest trading partners, and Beijing could lean on countries that depend heavily on Chinese consumers, particularly Europe’s largest economy, Germany. It could lobby countries like Hungary and Greece, which have previously stymied proposed E.U. statements critical of Beijing.The Latest on China: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach could have far-reaching effects and has revived concerns that the country is going back to a planned economy.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.A new security deal. The Solomon Islands signed a sweeping security agreement with China that could threaten the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The deal gives Beijing a foothold in an island chain that played a decisive role in World War II and could be used to block vital shipping lanes.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.Mr. Wang, the academic, said that the sanctions on Russia would also hurt European countries. That is likely to discourage measures that could antagonize China with its enormous market, because that would risk further economic damage and political turbulence across Europe.“The most important thing is not how China balances things out with them. What’s most important is that when their own sanctions hurt themselves, they will fracture internally,” he said. “Europe will slowly come to understand China’s stance.”So far, though, Chinese diplomacy is not winning friends in Europe.Since the invasion, Chinese diplomats have told European counterparts that Europe is acting as a puppet of the Biden administration by lining up so firmly against Russia, said four European officials with knowledge of the discussions. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private talks.Official Chinese media have echoed the criticism.“The United States has forced Europe into dangerous straits,” said a commentary last month about Europe’s response to the war in Ukraine from China’s main official news agency, Xinhua.“Europe needs to watch out against being stabbed in the back again by America,” said another commentary issued by China’s main television broadcaster, CCTV.The depiction of Europe as a passive underling of Washington reflects the Chinese Communist Party’s strategy of insisting that the United States caused the war in Ukraine by endangering Russian security. But the message has irked European officials.Image President Volodymyr Zelensky, right, with Ms. von der Leyen and the E.U.’s. foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. Mr. Borrell called the dialogue with China “anything but a dialogue.”Credit...Ukrainian Presidential Press Service, via Agence France-Presse - Getty Images“We condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine and support that country’s sovereignty and democracy, not because we ‘follow the U.S. blindly’, as China sometimes suggests, but because it is genuinely our own position,” Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, wrote this month. “This was an important message for the Chinese leadership to hear.”In 2014, Mr. Xi signaled his hopes for strong ties with the European Union by becoming the first Chinese president to visit Brussels for their annual summit. “China stands ready to work with the E.U. to let the sunlight of peace drive away the shadow of war,” Mr. Xi said that year in a speech to the College of Europe.But in his latest summit with the European Union, Mr. Xi avoided using the word “war.” He spoke of Russia’s invasion as a “crisis” or “situation,” said two of the European officials briefed on the talks. Mr. Xi argued that sanctions on Russia — by implication, not the invasion itself — were largely to blame for rising energy and food prices across the world, they said.“The Ukraine crisis must be properly handled, but we must not turn to reckless remedies in desperation,” Mr. Xi said, according to China’s official summary of the talks. “The world cannot become tied down by this issue.”European leaders appeared unimpressed. There were not joint statements or uplifting investment announcements for this summit.“The dialogue was everything but a dialogue,” Mr. Borrell, the E.U.’s foreign policy chief, said in a speech after the summit. “We could not talk about Ukraine a lot, but we did not agree on anything else.”Claire Fu and Liu Yi contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/world/asia/china-europe-russia-ukraine.html
33,"KYIV, Ukraine — He has spoken with two movie stars by video call from the bombarded and encircled city of Kyiv.His aides lobbied the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for an Oscar night show of support. He rereleased his own television show on Netflix in the middle of the war.President Volodymyr Zelensky, the actor turned wartime leader of Ukraine, has dedicated most of his public appearances to appeals to Western nations for lethal weaponry to fight the Russians: tanks, jets and missiles.But Mr. Zelensky, who before he became president had starred in romantic comedies and performed stand-up routines, has also pressed for celebrities and artists to speak up for his country, in what aides say is a worthwhile effort to solidify Ukraine’s global soft power advantage over Russia.“We live in the modern world, and we know that opinion makers and celebrities are important,” said Ekaterine Zguladze, a former deputy minister of interior now involved in the Ukrainian government’s effort to win support from artists, musicians and celebrities. “Not only politicians shape the world.”Ms. Zguladze added: “Right now, there exists genuine solidarity around the world for Ukraine. And this solidarity is not because of the heartbreaking images of destroyed cities and human tragedy, but because of the values we all share.”But Ukraine’s appeal to the academy, the organization that awards the Oscars, encountered drama of its own.Before the show, organizers said the war would be noted and the human toll honored, but did not commit to a video appearance by Mr. Zelensky, said Brian Keith Etheridge, a sitcom writer based in Los Angeles. He helped coordinate the Ukrainian government’s outreach to the academy, with help from Mila Kunis, an actress of Ukrainian origin, and her husband, Ashton Kutcher.“The concern that we were told is, they don’t want to overly politicize the show,” Mr. Etheridge said. “If Zelensky just says ‘thank you’ it will remind people, and it could raise millions of dollars. It’s such a giant platform just to have his face show up.”ImageSean Penn in Rzeszow, Poland, last week after leaving Ukraine, where he had been making a documentary about the Russian invasion.Credit...Angelos Tzortzinis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSean Penn, who had been filming a documentary in Ukraine when the war broke out, called for a boycott of the Oscars if Mr. Zelensky is not permitted to appear by video and vowed to smelt his own awards if the academy snubs the Ukrainian leader. The award statues are made of gold-plated bronze.If the Oscar producers did not allow an appearance for “the leadership in Ukraine, who are taking bullets and bombs for us, along with the Ukrainian children that they are trying to protect, then I think every single one of those people, and every bit of that decision, will have been the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history,” Mr. Penn told CNN in an interview.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the producers said they intended to commemorate the war’s toll but did not commit to a video appearance by Mr. Zelensky.“We’re going to be very thoughtful about how we acknowledge where we are in the world,” Will Packer, a producer of the Oscar ceremony, said Thursday at a news conference.ImagePreparations at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood on Saturday, before the Sunday’s Oscars ceremony.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesThe comedic actress Wanda Sykes, one of the ceremony’s co-hosts, noted of Mr. Zelensky, “Isn’t he busy right now?”Mr. Zelensky did not appear on the show. Ms. Kunis did speak about the war when she appeared on the telecast to introduce a Reba McEntire performance of her song from Ms. Kunis’s movie “Four Good Days.” Before turning the show over to Ms. McEntire, Ms. Kunis said, “recent global events have left many of us feeling gutted.”“Yet when you witness the strength and dignity of those facing such devastation, it’s impossible to not be moved by their resilience,” Ms. Kunis continued. “One cannot help but be in awe of those who find strength to keep fighting through unimaginable darkness.”The show also displayed three screens of gold text on black backgrounds after Ms. McEntire’s performance, calling on viewers to donate to the humanitarian effort.“While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water and emergency services,” the message read. “Resources are scarce, and we — collectively and as a global community — can do more.”While Mr. Zelensky’s aides had pressed for support during the show in whatever form it takes, seeking any avenue to win public backing in the West, the value of celebrity support in a shooting war is not universally acknowledged in Ukraine.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“Ultimately, it’s important what is happening on the ground,” Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said. “Everybody is doing what they can. I don’t know if one more speech of Zelensky will make a difference. But it’s good those who initiate it want to do it. Everybody wants to help in any way possible.”But Mr. Danylyuk said that “in the end, you need results,” like supplies of fighter jets, tanks or missiles for the Ukrainian Army.Mr. Zelensky has pressed on all fronts to convey to a broad audience, and particularly to countries that are providing weaponry, the moral imperative of supporting Ukraine in the war.ImageMr. Zelensky addressing Congress by video this month. He has worked to persuade a broad audience of the moral imperative of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia.Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times“In general, Zelensky is really following the news from Hollywood and looking for opportunities for support,” Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to the president’s chief of staff, said in an interview.The push for backing for Ukraine during the Oscars began a week ago, after Mr. Zelensky spoke on a video call from Kyiv with Mr. Kutcher and Ms. Kunis, to thank the couple for raising $35 million for Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid in a GoFundMe campaign, Mr. Leshchenko said.Ms. Kunis most recently starred in “Breaking News in Yuba County” and has a planned movie release by Netflix, “Luckiest Girl Alive.”“Ukrainians are proud and brave people who deserve our help in their time of need,” she wrote in the fund-raising appeal. “This unjust attack on Ukraine and humanity at large is devastating and the Ukrainian people need our support.”After the video call, Mr. Zelensky’s aides sought a last-minute slot at the Oscar ceremony.Mr. Zelensky has always had a keen sense of image and storytelling in politics. Earlier this month, he said he was aware that his repeated televised appeals for resistance, and continued presence in the beleaguered capital, had turned him into a symbol of bravery in many countries.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at a news conference early this month in Kyiv, the capital.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesThe Oscars are also a natural fit for an appeal by his government for humanitarian assistance, as many of his top aides are also movie industry veterans.The chief of the presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, was a media lawyer and movie producer. The head of the domestic intelligence agency, Ivan Bakanov, had been the director of the Kvartal 95 studio. A chief presidential adviser, Serhiy Shefir, was a screenwriter and producer whose major credits included a hit romantic comedy film, “Eight First Dates,” and a television series, “The In-laws.”Before becoming president of Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky played a president in his own television series, “Servant of the People,” which was rereleased on Netflix this month.

Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III met with President Volodymyr Zelensky.The delegation also said the United States would move to reopen its embassy in Kyiv, according to the officials.Ms. Brink’s nomination will end a delay that career diplomats have said would be baffling even in more tranquil times. The Ukraine ambassadorship has lacked a full-time occupant since 2019, when President Donald J. Trump unceremoniously removed Marie L. Yovanovitch. Shortly after, William B. Taylor Jr., a retired veteran diplomat, stepped in on a temporary basis until early 2020. The post has remained empty during the Biden administration even as dire warnings were issued last year that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.Ms. Brink has been a Foreign Service officer for 25 years, largely focusing on Europe and Eurasia. She was appointed to be the U.S. ambassador to Slovakia by Mr. Trump in 2019 and has served in two other former Soviet republics: Uzbekistan and Georgia.“It’s a long time coming,” said Mr. Taylor, who testified to Congress during the first impeachment hearing of Mr. Trump. “I’m glad it’s finally happening.”The U.S. mission in Ukraine has been managed by the chargé d’affaires, Kristina A. Kvien, a respected diplomat.“It will be great to have a Senate-confirmed ambassador out there who clearly has the authority to speak to the president,” Mr. Taylor said. He added that Ms. Brink would likely have bipartisan support in Congress because a large number of Republican senators have been backing Mr. Biden’s efforts on Ukraine.If confirmed, Ms. Brink will assume her role at a pivotal time in U.S.-Ukraine relations. She visited the Ukrainian-Slovak border the day after Russia’s invasion and said she had been “closely monitoring” the provision of aid from Slovakia to Ukraine.The imminent return of American diplomats to the embassy in Kyiv is expected to be embraced by lawmakers from both parties and by Ukrainian leaders as well. “I know U.S. diplomats are eager to get back,” Mr. Taylor said. “It’s important to be in the capital. It’s important to talk to the Ukrainians and listen to the Ukrainians.”At the same time, he said, “everybody understands the security concerns.”John Ismay, Cora Engelbrecht and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/world/europe/bridget-brink-ukraine-ambassador.html

With the pews full, an older woman dressed in a silk skirt knelt slowly on the hard stone floor beneath the vaulted ceiling to pray. Outside, near religious statues wrapped for protection against airstrikes, she placed a plastic cup of white spring flowers under a plaque dedicated to Pope John Paul II.Just a few steps away from the Roman Catholic cathedral, worshipers streamed into the Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church, a Greek Catholic Church that like most churches in Ukraine follows the Julian calendar, in which Easter falls next Sunday.For those churches this was Palm Sunday. Outside the garrison church on the cobblestone street, worshipers lined up to buy bouquets of pussy willow and boxwood branches, tied with ribbons in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, yellow and blue, being sold to support the armed forces. Instead of palm fronds, which are used in other places to commemorate Jesus entering Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, Ukrainians use pussy willow, a harbinger of spring. On Saturday, Lviv’s flower market was crowded with women from surrounding villages selling pussy willow branches wrapped up in twine with spring flowers, berries and greenery. Ukrainians take them to church to be blessed and then take them home to display long after Easter.Lviv has more than 100 churches, some of them in the historic center of the city, which is listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site. The city in western Ukraine was spared much of the destruction of churches, although not their closure, by atheist Soviet authorities who ruled the country until the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991.Christianity in Ukraine officially dates back more than a thousand years, and today about 85 percent of Ukrainians are Christian, the majority of them Eastern Orthodox. The war has split the Orthodox churches in Russia and Ukraine, with Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, expressing support for it.At Saint Michael’s Golden Domed Cathedral in Kyiv on Sunday, Metropolitan Epiphanius, the Orthodox head of Kyiv and All Ukraine, said in a sermon that the country’s “enemies from the north” had turned the Russian Orthodox Church into an instrument of “lies, enslavement, murder and all other evil.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/europe/lviv-easter-sunday-ukraine-russia-war.html

39,"LUBLIN, Poland — On a recent morning, I sat in the sun-filled dining room of a tidy house in eastern Poland, across from one of the most generous men I’ve ever met.He was a Polish apple farmer who took in eight Ukrainian refugees, all complete strangers, and gave them a place to stay, cooked them meals, brought them armloads of fresh bread every morning and has been trying to find them jobs.But when it came to talking about World War II, this is what he said: “The real disaster started when the Russians invaded. The Russians were worse than the Germans.”“The Germans,” he said, “did not hurt ordinary people.”My first reaction fell somewhere between disappointment and silent outrage: How could this farmer be so kind and so blind? How could he say the Germans didn’t hurt “ordinary people” when they murdered millions of Jews right here in Poland? The biggest death camps were in Poland, and the more I thought about it, the more I was shocked by what the farmer said.But then I realized he and I were actually engaging in a similar type of thinking.He couldn’t stop obsessing about Russia, which occupied Poland during World War II and controlled it for many decades afterward, and is now dropping bombs just a few miles from the border. And I couldn’t stop thinking about the Holocaust. Neither of us had lived through all that history ourselves — the trauma was handed down to us from our families — but both of us were trapped in the past.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/world/europe/a-reporter-covering-the-war-reflects-on-the-legacy-of-the-holocaust.html
40,"BANGKOK — As the bonds of traditional alliances fray across the globe, the Royal Thai Army, the United States’ oldest treaty partner in Asia, has cast a wide net.This year, with the world reeling from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Thai soldiers hosted American troops for Cobra Gold, annual military exercises that are one of the largest shows of force in the Asia Pacific. A few months before, they participated in Shared Destiny, peacekeeping drills run by the People’s Liberation Army of China. And in 2020, the Thais hedged their bets further, signing an agreement for their cadets to receive training at a defense academy in Moscow.The geopolitical landscape following the Ukraine invasion has often been likened to that of a new Cold War. While the main antagonists may be the same — the United States, Russia and, increasingly, China — the roles played by much of the rest of the world have changed, reshaping a global order that held for more than three-quarters of a century.Governments representing more than half of humanity have refused to take a side, avoiding the binary accounting of us-versus-them that characterized most of the post-World War II era. In a United Nations General Assembly vote this month to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, dozens of countries abstained, including Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico and Singapore. (The resolution succeeded anyway.)ImageU.S. Marines gather after the joint Cobra Gold exercise in the coastal Thai province of Rayong in 2020.Credit...Lillian Suwanrumpha/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOnce proxy battlegrounds for superpowers, swaths of Africa, Asia and Latin America are staking their independence. The return of a bloc of nonaligned nations harks back to a period in which leaders of the post-colonial movement resisted having their destinies shaped by imperialism. It also points to the confidence of smaller countries, no longer dependent on a single ideological or economic patron, to go their own way.“Without a doubt, the countries of Southeast Asia don’t want to be pulled into a new Cold War or be forced to take sides in any great power competition,” said Zachary Abuza, a security specialist at the National War College in Washington. “As they say in Southeast Asia, when the elephants fight, the grass gets trampled.”Having to align themselves with one power or another, Mr. Abuza added, left many nations around the world “desperately poor and underdeveloped at the end of the Cold War.”As a result, even the United States, the Cold War’s victor, cannot count on the support of some of its traditional partners in vocally condemning Russia for its attack on a sovereign, democratic nation. The NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011 and the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 have only heightened mistrust of the West. Both military actions left countries in those regions struggling with the political fallout for years after.“The crux of the matter is that African countries feel infantilized and neglected by Western countries, which are also accused of not living up to their soaring moral rhetoric on sovereignty and territorial sanctity,” said Ebenezer Obadare, senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.Indonesia, a sprawling democracy once ruled by a dictator favored by the United States for his anti-communist stance, has said that it will welcome President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when the country hosts the Group of 20 meetings this year.

Trump’s presidency, the United States pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an expansive trade pact that was meant to counter China’s way of doing business. Countries like Vietnam that had staked their reputations on joining felt betrayed, once again, by Washington.Mexico, a longtime U.S. ally, has emphasized its neutrality, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has rejected sanctions on Russia.“Mexico’s neutrality is not neutral,” said Tony Payan of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. “Mexico is poking Washington in the eye.”About one-third of American ambassadorships in Latin America and the Caribbean remain unfilled.

Apart from a sense of autocratic camaraderie, ideology is no longer part of Moscow’s allure. Russia has neither the patronage cash nor the geopolitical clout of the Soviet Union.Venezuela, Russia’s staunchest supporter in Latin America, received a high-level American delegation on the heels of the Ukraine invasion. Nicaragua, which became one of the first countries to back Russia’s recognition of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, has since tempered its enthusiasm.During a March U.N. vote condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cuba abstained, rather than backing Moscow, although it and Nicaragua later rejected the effort to kick Russia off the Human Rights Council.“They’re trying to walk a fine line between certainly not celebrating the invasion, but also not clearly condemning it, arguing in favor of peace,” said Renata Keller, a Cuba expert at the University of Nevada, Reno.The most noticeable hedging has come from Africa, which accounted for nearly half the countries that abstained in the March U.N. vote.The Latest on China: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach could have far-reaching effects and has revived concerns that the country is going back to a planned economy.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.A new security deal. The Solomon Islands signed a sweeping security agreement with China that could threaten the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The deal gives Beijing a foothold in an island chain that played a decisive role in World War II and could be used to block vital shipping lanes.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.“We don’t know why they are fighting,” President Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania said in an interview, referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.She added that she was “not sure” there was a clear aggressor in the conflict.For Thailand, the decision to train with the American, Russian and Chinese militaries, as well as to buy weaponry from each country, is part of its long history of balancing between great powers. Deft diplomacy allowed Thailand to emerge as the only nation in the region not to be colonized.ImagePresident Trump signing a presidential memoranda withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the Oval Office, in January 2017.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe current drift away from the United States, which used Thailand as a staging ground for the Vietnam War, also stems from the political pedigree of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in a military coup eight years ago.“Though Thailand may currently appear as a democracy, it is at heart an autocracy,” said Paul Chambers, a lecturer in international affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand. “A regime such as this will have autocratic bedfellows, including in Moscow.”The same holds in Uganda, which receives almost a billion dollars in American aid and is a key Western ally in the fight against regional militancy. Yet the government of President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has been criticized by the United States and the European Union for a pattern of human rights violations.Mr. Museveni has responded by assailing the West’s interference in Libya and Iraq. The president’s son, who also commands the country’s land forces, tweeted that a “majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia’s stand in Ukraine.”Uganda, like dozens of other countries, can afford to speak up because of a new top trading partner: China. This economic reality, even if Beijing promises more than it delivers, has shielded nations once dependent on other superpowers from stark geopolitical choices.Strategically located countries like Djibouti, host to Camp Lemonnier, the largest permanent U.S. base on the African continent, have diversified. A few years ago, after President Ismail Omar Guelleh’s invitation, Beijing established its first overseas military outpost in Djibouti. Mr. Guelleh also secured loans from the Chinese to help develop ports, free trade zones and a railway.ImageChinese People’s Liberation Army troops at the opening ceremony for China’s new military base in Djibouti in August 2017.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesGrowing Chinese engagement has provided African countries with “alternative investment, alternative markets and alternative ideas of development,” said Cobus van Staden, at the South African Institute of International Affairs.But if the world feels more comfortably multipolar these days, the ripple effects of the fighting in Ukraine are a reminder that globalization quickly links far-flung nations.Escalating global prices for fuel, food and fertilizer, all a result of war in Ukraine, have heightened hardship in Africa and Asia. Already contending with a devastating drought, East Africa now has at least 13 million people facing severe hunger.And populations outside of Europe know too well that their refugees — such as Syrians, Venezuelans, Afghans, South Sudanese and the Rohingya of Myanmar — cannot expect the welcome given to displaced Ukrainians. In a race for finite reserves of care, aid groups have warned of the perils of donor fatigue for the world’s most vulnerable.“The whole world,” President Hassan of Tanzania said, referring to Russia and Ukraine, “is affected when these countries are fighting.”Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok, Abdi Latif Dahir from Nairobi, Kenya, and Oscar Lopez from Mexico City.

41,"A planned benefit concert in support of Ukraine was canceled in Vienna on Monday amid concerns about the Russian-based ensemble it was to feature, MusicAeterna, which is led by the conductor Teodor Currentzis and is supported by a state-owned bank in Russia.The concert, organized by the Konzerthaus in Vienna, one of Austria’s premier halls, was to take place on Tuesday and feature MusicAeterna, which is based in St. Petersburg and is financed in part by VTB Bank, one of Russia’s largest financial institutions. The United States and other western countries have recently imposed sanctions on the bank because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The Vienna Konzerthaus said it canceled the concert after the Ukrainian ambassador to Austria, Vasyl Khymynets, expressed concern about featuring Russian artists at an event meant to benefit Ukraine. The ensemble’s founder, Mr. Currentzis, who was born in Athens, is a charismatic conductor who has built a large following in Russia and abroad.“The Vienna Konzerthaus cannot ignore the political dimension of the performance of a St. Petersburg-based orchestra at a time of immense suffering caused by the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine,” Matthias Naske, the hall’s chief executive and artistic director, said in a statement. “We understand and share the despair over the war crimes in Ukraine and condemn this aggression without reservation.”The Konzerthaus said that it would suspend ticket sales for future appearances by MusicAeterna until the group secured an independent source of financing. But it also said it would allow MusicAeterna to perform a separate concert planned for Monday night. (The ensemble already performed at the hall on Sunday.)Mr. Khymynets and the Ukrainian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The cancellation of the benefit concert comes as tensions between Russia and the west continue to reverberate in the performing arts. Several high-profile Russian artists have lost global engagements in recent weeks because of their ties to the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.MusicAeterna, renowned for its intense, electric performances, has come under scrutiny for its connections to VTB Bank, which has helped finance some of its tours and recording projects. Mr. Currentzis called for peace in Ukraine in a statement issued last month by the SWR Symphony Orchestra in Germany, where he is chief conductor, though he has not directly criticized the Russian government or Mr. Putin.“Teodor Currentzis and the members of the SWR Symphony Orchestra unequivocally support the common appeal for peace and reconciliation,” the statement said. The orchestra has said it was aware of MusicAeterna’s association with VTB Bank, but it has continued to defend Mr. Currentzis. “From today’s perspective, this is certainly problematic, but it has existed for a longer period of time,” the statement said, referring to the bank’s support for MusicAeterna.The benefit concert in Vienna was to feature works by Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and others.MusicAeterna is set to perform in Germany, Austria and France in the coming weeks. Mr. Currentzis is scheduled to lead the ensemble in a production of Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle” at the Salzburg Festival this summer, paired with “De temporum fine comoedia” by the German composer Carl Orff. The Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany, another major concert hall, said on Monday it had no plans to cancel a series of engagements this week by MusicAeterna.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/arts/music/ukraine-benefit-musicaeterna-currentzis.html
42,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia congratulated Emmanuel Macron on Monday for his re-election as France’s president after defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate many in Russia favored as a potential game-changing option for the Kremlin amid the threat of new sanctions and in the midst of the war in Ukraine.“I sincerely wish you success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being,” Mr. Putin said in a congratulatory note to Mr. Macron, published by the Kremlin.Mr. Macron has been one of the few Western politicians willing to engage with Mr. Putin, relentlessly trying to push the Russian leader toward diplomacy. Since the start of the war on Feb. 24, the two presidents have had nine telephone conversations, according to the Kremlin.However, Mr. Macron has been bound by the French commitment to the trans-Atlantic unity, something that Ms. Le Pen, his rival, was willing to weaken. Ms. Le Pen, whose National Rally party borrowed millions from a Russian bank over the past decade, said rapprochement with Russia would be her foreign-policy priority once the fighting in Ukraine stopped.A victory by Ms. Le Pen would have been seen as a great triumph for Mr. Putin, who has risked his country’s long-term economic well-being for the sake of territorial gain in Ukraine.For some commentators in Russia, however, it wasn’t Ms. Le Pen’s far-right or pro-Moscow stance that prevented her from getting elected, but that she did not go far enough in endorsing the Kremlin.Zakhar Prilepin, a conservative Russian writer and politician, said on social media that instead of “trying to get glued together with Macron into one undistinguishable ball,” Ms. Le Pen “had to say that she supports the special operation, would quit NATO, and send the Foreign Legion, Algerian special forces and her own security detail to Belgorod for drills.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/world/europe/putin-macron-french-election.html

Martin, a farmer who had defused explosives in the German Army, was angered by a week of television footage documenting Russia’s invasion.They were among several foreign military volunteers waiting on Friday at a hostel in Lviv, in western Ukraine, where the Ukrainian government had put them up before training. After the Russian invasion in February, Ukraine announced it was creating a foreign legion, inviting non-Ukrainians with military experience to come and join the fight.None of the small group of volunteers interviewed by The New York Times had received a response when they contacted the Ukrainian embassies in their home countries, but they decided to make the trip anyway. Many of the foreigners said they had been inspired by what they saw on social media and TV.The foreign volunteers asked to be identified by only their first names because of concerns they could be prosecuted upon returning home for fighting for a foreign army. A U.S. law dating to the 18th century bans citizens from fighting countries not at war with the United States, but it is rarely enforced.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said more than 20,000 people from 52 countries have volunteered to fight, a number that could not be verified. A Russian missile attack two weeks ago on a training base being used for foreign volunteers near Liviv killed at least 35 military personnel and civilians, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia said it killed 180 foreign military volunteers. Neither figure could be independently confirmed.The volunteers waiting in the hostel Friday were undeterred.Luis, 29, said he served with the Mexican Army fighting drug cartels a decade ago, but until last week, he was an events photographer in Chihuahua City, Mexico, photographing mostly weddings. Then, scrolling through Reddit, he found an Associated Press photo showing an unidentified pregnant woman on a stretcher, being carried out by rescue workers after a Russian strike against a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Russian officials said Ukrainian forces had been using the hospital as a base and said the images were fake.“I saw the face of my sister in that woman,” Luis said. “I do not have children yet, but I imagined how the baby’s father felt, how the woman and her family felt.”He had never met a Ukrainian before flying to Europe. But when he read the woman and her baby had died, he decided to close his studio, sell his cameras and book the four flights to get to Poland, from where he drove across the border to Ukraine.He told his parents, his 25-year-old sister and his girlfriend of four years that he was going on vacation. “They would never understand,” he said. “I don’t know how to start that conversation.”Will was working as a truck driver and postal worker when he saw the image of the tank shooting a civilian vehicle. In the video, which was disseminated by Ukrainian news media and appeared to have been taken by security cameras on the street, a civilian car with a sticker in the back indicating an occupant with a disability stops short of an intersection before a tank shoots it. The driver and a passenger were killed. “These were civilians,” said Will, 33. “They were just going about their day, you know? It’s senseless. It’s brutality on a whole other level.” He couldn’t remain on the sidelines, he added, because as a former Marine, “I have training, I have capabilities.”Another volunteer, Martin, 35, a farmer from Germany, said that television footage of a war on European soil convinced him to come to Ukraine.“I have the army experience, and I want to defend Europe,” he said, before heading out in the rain to follow a Ukrainian official taking them to a training base.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/world/europe/ukraine-military-volunteers.html
44,"In a small parish in northern Italy affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, the mostly Ukrainian worshipers — IT specialists, migrant factory laborers, nurses and cleaners — decided to repudiate the full-throated support for the war in Ukraine from Patriarch Kirill of Moscow.The Moscow Patriarch had repeatedly bestowed blessings on the Russian military, giving a historical golden icon of the Virgin Mary to a senior commander, for example, and casting the war as a holy struggle to protect Russia from what he called Western scourges like gay pride parades. He has been a vocal supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin, with the church receiving vast financial resources in return.“We saw that the Moscow Patriarchate was not engaged in theology, it was simply interested in supporting the ideology of the state,” said Archpriest Volodymyr Melnichuk of the Church of the Elevation of the Cross in Udine, Italy, “In essence the patriarch betrayed his Ukrainian flock.”So on March 31, the Ukrainian cleric wrote a letter severing all ties to the Moscow Patriarchate.With the Eastern Orthodox Easter approaching this Sunday, similar tensions are rippling through the church’s more than 200 million faithful, concentrated in eastern and southern Europe. Around the world, the war is dividing national churches, parishes and even families as they reassess relations with Patriarch Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church.In the United States, some believers are switching churches. In France, Orthodox seminary students petitioned their bishop to break with the Moscow Patriarchate. In the Netherlands, the police had to intervene at a Rotterdam church after parishioners came to blows over the war.ImageArchpriest Volodymyr Melnichuk praying for peace with Ukrainian members of the congregation at the Church of the Elevation of the Cross.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThe Ukraine war has pitted combatants under the Moscow Patriarch against each other, and has placed Ukrainian worshipers in an especially untenable position. By tradition, Orthodox worshipers pray for their patriarch at all services.“How can you accept prayers for the patriarch who is blessing the soldiers trying to kill your son?” said Andreas Loudaros, editor of Orthodoxia.info, an Athens-based website that covers church affairs.Doctrinal disputes and intrigues within the Eastern Orthodox Church often spool out over decades, if not centuries. But with remarkable speed, the war has widened schisms long kept below the surface.Unlike the Roman Catholic Church, with its single, uncontested leader, each of the 15 Orthodox branches enjoys significant sovereignty. Heated debates have erupted within the Eastern Orthodox Church in numerous countries whether to openly ostracize Patriarch Kirill and Russia.The Moscow Patriarchate has sought to anoint itself the true seat of Orthodoxy ever since Constantinople, now Istanbul, fell to Islamic invaders in 1453. So Moscow has been at loggerheads for centuries with the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, always the spiritual leader of the church. But, the testy relations between Kirill and the current ecumenical patriarch, Bartholomew, burst into the open over the war.ImagePatriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, at a service on April 7 in Moscow. He has stirred anger among some of the faithful around the world for endorsing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and not condemning the killing of civilians, including his own parishioners.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“He should not have identified so much with President Putin and even called Russia’s war against Ukraine ‘sacred,’” the patriarch recently told a group of students.“It is damaging to the prestige of the whole of Orthodoxy because Orthodoxy doesn’t support war, violence, terrorism,” Bartholomew said in an interview in Istanbul.Ukraine has been a particular source of antagonism between the two hierarchs. In 2019, Patriarch Bartholomew granted independence, called “autocephaly,” to a previously unsanctioned church in Ukraine, which had been subordinate to Moscow since 1686.Afterward, the Russian church severed contacts with Bartholomew. More than half Ukraine’s parishes rejected the decision and stayed under Moscow’s jurisdiction.Of the 45 dioceses in Ukraine, encompassing nearly 20,000 parishes, about 22 have stopped mentioning Patriarch Kirill during prayers, said Sergei Chapnin, a Russian religious scholar and frequent church critic.ImagePall bearers carrying the casket of a Ukrainian soldier on Monday on the outskirts of Lviv. About half the 45 dioceses in Ukraine have stopped mentioning Patriarch Kirill during prayers.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesThat is the first step toward breaking with Moscow, though still far from a formal rupture. But the dispute makes it difficult for many Ukrainian bishops to switch allegiances now.Some faithful in Ukraine question the silence of the bishops, wondering aloud whether they are fans of Mr. Putin, have been bribed or blackmailed to stay quiet or are hedging their bets lest Moscow prevails in the war.Archpriest Andriy Pinchuk, 44, the former mayor of a small agricultural village just south of the central city of Dnipro, said the hesitancy dismays many parish priests. Russian troops have destroyed countless churches.“We are ashamed to look into the eyes of regular Ukrainians, we are ashamed of the horrible aggressive words that Patriarch Kirill is saying constantly, we are ashamed of the Ukrainian bishops who put their heads in the sand and fear a rupture with the Moscow Patriarch,” said Father Pinchuk. Ukrainians constitute a significant part of the Moscow Patriarch’s flock, so losing them would be a blow.Father Pinchuk is the author of a petition signed by some 400 Ukrainian clerics asking church hierarchs to declare as heresy Kirill’s support for the Kremlin’s Russkii Mir or “Russian World,” project, which among other things has tried to extend church influence outside Russia as a foreign policy tool.ImageThe church’s ecumenical patriarch, Bartholomew, in Istanbul earlier this month, is at odds with Patriarch Kirill over Ukraine.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times“The future of any church in Ukraine will not be linked to Moscow unless it wins this war,” said Christophe D’Aloisio, a visiting professor of Eastern Christian and Ecumenical Studies at the University of Louvain in Belgium and an Orthodox parish priest, who signed a declaration in March against the “Russian World” project by more than 1,300 Orthodox scholars and theologians. “But it is the wrong moment to position yourself for or against.”Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has provoked widespread anger with a series of sermons and speeches, including saying that the country is battling the Antichrist, and urged Russians to rally around the government. Kirill has avoided condemning widely documented attacks on civilians, many of whom are his parishioners. Most national churches have not condemned Kirill.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J.

It lists church projects financed around the world in Bulgaria, Georgia, Poland, Serbia and the United States, among others.Numerous recipients have not denounced the war. “When you get money from Moscow it is not easy to be critical,” said Mr. D’Aloisio.ImageA service at St. George’s Church, seat of the of the church’s ecumenical patriarchate, in Istanbul. Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesAbout 300 priests, mostly inside Russia, signed a petition against the war. Three Lithuanian priests who were outspoken critics were just fired.In the United States, some adherents expressed anger that although the two main American branches of Russian origin, the Orthodox Church in America and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, had condemned the fighting and worked to help refugees, they avoided criticizing Patriarch Kirill directly.An influx of converts in recent years, drawn by President Putin portraying himself as a bulwark against the West’s moral collapse, has intensified the wrangling.“It has torn the church apart in some ways,” said the Very Rev. Dr. John Jillions, a retired associate professor of religion and a former parish priest in Bridgeport, Conn. “I think that they are too hesitant, they need to come out much more forcefully that they are against Putin’s aggression and Patriarch Kirill’s apparent support.”Many people are questioning why St. Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary in Yonkers accepted a $250,000 donation from the Russian state religious foundation to name a chair in biblical studies after Kirill, suggesting that the money be returned or spent on Ukrainian refugees.ImageSunday service earlier this month at St. George's Church in Istanbul.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThe Very Rev. Dr. Chad Hatfield, the president of the seminary, said that the donation was received before the invasion and was under review, and that the Orthodox Church of America had condemned the war.Archpriest Victor Potapov in Washington, D.C., speaking for the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, called it wrong to single out Russia for blame, and said the church was offering fervent prayers for the war to end.Some parishioners are switching churches over the issue. “This is not my church, I cannot go to a church headed by a patriarch who is supporting war,” said Lena S. Zezulin. She left her church, St. Seraphim’s Russian Orthodox Church in Sea Cliff, Long Island, where she was baptized. She cannot convince her mother, aged 90, to quit.By all accounts, a serious cleavage in the church appears inevitable, but the course of the war will determine its depth and the scar tissue left behind.On Palm Sunday, sitting in the courtyard of an Orthodox church frequented by Ukrainians in Istanbul, Nadiia Kliuieva reeled off the terrible legacy from a conflict sanctified by Kirill, including children killed, women raped and the pain of Ukrainians everywhere.“I don’t know what kind of Ukrainian you would have to be to keep an association with the Moscow Patriarchate,” she said. “I think many people have opened their eyes.”Neil MacFarquhar reported from Istanbul and Sophia Kishkovsky from Long Island.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/world/europe/ukraine-war-russian-orthodox-church.html
45,"WASHINGTON — The United States will send an additional $800 million worth of military and other security aid to Ukraine and step up intelligence sharing, American officials announced on Wednesday, as Russian forces appeared to be preparing for a new offensive in the country’s east.President Biden promised that the assistance would include more of the weapons that the United States has previously given Ukraine, as well as new capabilities. The expanded intelligence sharing will make available more information about Russian troops in Crimea and the eastern Donbas region, parts of the country that Russia and Russian-backed separatists have occupied since 2014 or 2015.Mr. Biden delivered the news about the arms package to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine during a nearly hourlong telephone call on Wednesday, according to White House officials. It came as the United States is considering whether to send a high-level official to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, as another sign of support, according to a person familiar with the internal discussions.In a statement, Mr. Biden vowed to continue efforts to assist Ukraine, which has been pummeled by Russian artillery over the past month.“As I assured President Zelensky, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,” Mr. Biden said.The issue of what military assistance to send Ukraine, and how fast to send it, has taken on greater urgency as the war has become a series of grinding battles between the Ukrainian and Russian armies. Mr. Zelensky has pleaded for more sophisticated weapons from the United States and its allies.The Biden administration has responded with antitank weapons, including Javelin missiles, and other weapons that Ukrainian soldiers have used to repel Russian forces, especially in the north of the country. The United States has so far resisted helping Ukraine acquire fighter jets and other weaponry that could be used against targets inside Russia.Mr. Biden said on Wednesday that the additional aid for Ukraine would include more sophisticated weaponry, such as artillery systems and armored personnel carriers.Top Pentagon officials met with the leaders of the largest U.S. military contractors on Wednesday to discuss the flow of arms to Ukraine and what additional capabilities would help the country defend itself.But the United States is also looking at advanced weapons in European stockpiles that Ukrainian troops already know how to use.Mr. Biden said the United States would transfer additional helicopters as well, though he did not indicate whether they would come directly from the United States or from another country. The United States previously provided Ukraine with five Russian-designed Mi-17 helicopters that the Afghan military had once used.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.The United States is also providing 18 155-millimeter howitzers, the first time it has sent that weapon to Ukraine, and 40,000 artillery rounds.Last week, Slovakia agreed to send Ukraine a Soviet-era S-300 air defense system after the United States committed to positioning a more modern Patriot system in Slovakia. The United States has also helped European countries transfer Russian-designed T-72 tanks to Ukraine.Russian forces failed to take Kyiv after trying for several weeks and now appear to be regrouping in eastern Ukraine, including in the Donbas region.

Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said the latest weapons shipment approved by Mr. Biden would be sent to Ukraine as soon as possible.“We’re aware of the clock,” he said at a news conference on Wednesday. “And we know time is not our friend.”As the conflict in Ukraine has evolved, intelligence agencies have adjusted their approach to ensure officials have flexibility “to share detailed, timely intelligence with the Ukrainians,” a U.S. intelligence official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the handling of classified material.Biden administration officials have said they have been giving Ukraine the most relevant information at any given moment. Still, the administration has been reluctant to help the Ukrainians target Russian forces in Russia, and Republican lawmakers said that concern by the administration had extended to Russian forces in Crimea and the Donbas.The stepped-up intelligence sharing was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.U.S. officials have defended their intelligence sharing with Ukraine. On Tuesday, Kathleen H. Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, said that “the intelligence support that we have provided has been vital” and that the information given to Ukraine had been “high-end.” A U.S. official said the previous restrictions did not have a practical effect on the conflict.Other officials said that as the Russian military shifted its strategy away from the attack on Kyiv to reinforcing the operations in the Donbas, U.S. intelligence agencies began to look at whether their guidance on what information could be shared needed to be expanded.Republicans have been critical of the Pentagon and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, saying they have failed to provide enough information to Ukraine about the Russian forces and separatist groups that have been stationed in parts of Ukraine since 2014 or 2015.In a letter released on Monday, Senate Republicans said they were concerned that not enough was being done to share critical intelligence with Ukrainians. The letter, from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and others, specifically referred to providing intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them “retake every inch of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, which includes Crimea and the Donbas.”Helene Cooper contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/us/politics/biden-weapons-ukraine.html
46,"When announcing Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine back in February, President Vladimir Putin mentioned NATO 40 times. It was clear he wanted to present NATO as the devil — but it wasn’t always like that.I first met Mr. Putin while serving as the prime minister of Denmark in 2002. Back then, he was still willing to engage and work with the West. For some time, Russia even assisted the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.This all changed with the “color revolutions” of the mid-2000s: Seeing democratic movements spring up in Georgia and Ukraine terrified Mr. Putin. He worried Russia would be next. When I took over as NATO’s secretary general in 2009, Mr. Putin coldly informed me the organization I oversaw was a relic that should be resigned to history.The irony is that Mr. Putin’s cruel war in Ukraine will achieve the opposite of his ambitions: NATO will emerge from this crisis larger, stronger and more united. The sight of Russian tanks pouring across the border into Ukraine shattered many long-held beliefs about security in Europe. Nowhere is this more true than in Finland and Sweden. As Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland dryly put it, “Russia is not the neighbor we imagined.”The change in public opinion is even more remarkable. Last year, an annual poll showed that only 26 percent of Finns wanted to join NATO. A more recent survey demonstrates this number has now increased to 68 percent. The same is true in Sweden. Both populations recognize the new reality in Europe. A dictator in charge of a nuclear-armed state has launched a full-scale invasion of a neighboring country. Joining a powerful military alliance with a specific commitment to collective defense is the logical response.Finland and Sweden should seize this opportunity to become part of NATO. The governments of both countries should apply before the NATO summit in June. Finland and Sweden could join NATO relatively quickly and painlessly. Both countries are already closely aligned with the organization, take part in joint exercises and clearly meet the political requirements for membership, including a democratic system of governance and a market economy. At NATO headquarters, membership could be approved overnight. While the decision would need to be ratified by all members of the alliance, the urgency of the situation could expedite the process to a matter of months.Finland and Sweden joining NATO is a win-win. Both countries would receive the security guarantee of NATO’s Article 5 on collective defense, and NATO would gain new capabilities in a strategically important region. This convenient buffer zone between Russia and current NATO members would make it easier to react to any incursion by Russian forces into the Baltic States.While the debate on membership continues, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine will go into overdrive. It will warn against further NATO expansion, claiming it will destabilize the region and make war more likely.Of course, this is not the case. The only person destabilizing Europe is Mr. Putin. Russia targeted Ukraine, and Georgia before that, precisely because they are not members of NATO. Russia’s international strategy is to threaten escalation in order to bully less powerful countries into submission and push more powerful ones toward inaction. In this war, Mr. Putin threatened to target NATO convoys bringing weapons to Ukraine and to cut off gas supplies to Europe if bills were not paid in rubles. On both of those issues, the West called Russia’s bluff. The threats did not materialize.If Sweden and Finland do join NATO — especially in the face of such threats — it would show Mr. Putin that war is counterproductive, that war only strengthens Western unity, resolve and military preparedness.Finland and Sweden are not the only countries reassessing decades-old foreign policy doctrine in the face of Russia’s invasion. Across Europe, governments are raising military spending to meet NATO’s 2 percent target. About time. For too long, the United States has carried too great a share of the burden for European security.The most significant change is in Germany. Its refusal to spend more on defense has been a consistent source of tension within the NATO alliance, which almost reached a breaking point during the Trump presidency. The war in Ukraine finally pushed the German government to act. It has committed to spending $112.7 billion on military procurement and more than 2 percent of its G.D.P. on defense going forward. Germany has also reversed its longstanding policy of not exporting arms to conflict zones, a policy that was based on the collective guilt and trauma of World War II. The country’s new positions on military spending and weapons exports have the potential to transform Germany into one of the most advanced militaries in the world.Despite these commendable changes, Germany must do more. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other political leaders are still dragging their feet over imposing sanctions and sending higher-caliber arms to Ukraine. But if Germany ended all import of Russian oil and gas, Mr. Putin would be forced to quickly stop the war in Ukraine.It is unconscionable that while Ukrainians are being slaughtered, NATO members still send hundreds of millions of euros every day to Mr. Putin’s coffers to buy oil and gas. Political leaders who oppose a total halt to transfers to Russia are complicit in Mr. Putin’s war crimes. They are indirectly paying the wages of those who committed atrocities in Bucha. Ending all imports of Russian oil and gas would come at a significant price, but it would be small compared to the continued destruction in Ukraine. Here too, Finland is moving in the right direction, promising to end the country’s reliance on Russian energy imports in a matter of “weeks or months.”NATO’s previous posture of deterrence with Russia did not work: It failed to avoid a full-scale war in Europe. If Mr. Putin succeeds in Ukraine, he is not likely to stop there. He will continue to test NATO wherever he sees weak links. Countries that are closely aligned with the Western alliance but not protected by its Article 5 — such as Sweden and Finland — will be at risk.For the past 70 years, NATO has been the bedrock of security in Europe, creating an environment in which freedom and democracy can thrive. Mr. Putin may want to see NATO resigned to history but his actions in Ukraine show why the alliance is needed now more than ever.Anders Fogh Rasmussen (@AndersFoghR) served as the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 2009-2014 and as the prime minister of Denmark from 2001-2009.

48,"When Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February, trampling on the sovereignty of a neighbor, international sanctions were the best path forward for the United States and its allies to take. The ruthlessness and grave atrocities toward civilians that have ensued since only reinforce that call.As of this week, those sanctions have made dents in both Russia’s economy and its ability to wage war in Ukraine. As foreign companies have withdrawn operations from Russia, Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, estimated that some 200,000 people there are at risk of losing their jobs, and there’s some evidence that the decision by Europe and the United States to restrict the export of microchips has already affected Russia’s ability to produce and repair tanks. The sanctions have also sent a vital message of support to the Ukrainian people.It is undeniable that the United States and its allies were — and still are — right to use sanctions to try to end this war.Yet as the Biden administration weighs the next phase of this conflict, Americans should be cleareyed about the limits of what sanctions are likely to achieve.It’s too early to know how history will judge this unprecedented, sweeping effort to make Mr. Putin pay a price for his war. Nor can we predict the unintended consequences these sanctions may produce in the coming months or years. But there are lots of indications that the war — and the sanctions it triggered — could last a long time. As it is wise to have definite goals and an exit strategy when a country enters a military conflict, the same is true for waging economic warfare.The West has turned to sanctions as a tool with growing frequency since World War II — in places as varied as South Africa, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Iran. It is relatively easy to apply sanctions, and they nearly always satisfy the domestic political need to “do something” short of military engagement.Here’s the issue: Sanctions historically have not been particularly effective in changing regimes, and their record at changing dictators’ behavior is mixed at best.Cuba, Venezuela and North Korea never bowed to American demands. Where there are success stories, they are modest: Crippling sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program, but that regime never stopped asserting its right to enrich uranium. The bite of sanctions eventually contributed to the end of white-minority rule in South Africa, but it was just one of many factors.Or, to understand the limits of sanctions, Americans might consider our own national experience. When Arab nations imposed an oil embargo on the United States in the 1970s, it caused a lot of pain, but it did not cause the United States to stop supporting Israel.The Biden administration deserves credit for laying the groundwork for multilateral sanctions, which are the only kind that have the hope of success. The greatest effects seen so far from the sanctions have been by unplugging Russia, if only partially, from the international financial system through moves like freezing billions of dollars in assets overseas and taking some Russian banks off SWIFT, the global messaging system for financial transactions. These far-reaching punishments, unthinkable even a few months ago, displayed a new sense of cooperation among the United States and the other Group of 7 countries.Even Mr. Putin acknowledged that they have “achieved certain results.” But focusing on helping Ukraine financially and with military equipment might prove more productive than thinking up new sanctions on Russia. The Biden administration appears to recognize this, at least in part, with its latest $800 million in military aid and $500 million in emergency funding announced on Thursday.Sanctions alone — at least any sanctions that European countries would be willing to now consider — will not bring Russia to its knees any time soon. As long as Europeans still depend on Russian oil and gas, Russia will be able to depend on significant income from that relationship. The spat over whether gas deliveries will be paid in rubles, as Russia has demanded, only highlights the bind that European countries find themselves in.The oligarchs who are losing their yachts and the people who are tightening their belts have little sway over the Kremlin. In Russia, with average citizens, Mr. Putin has grist for a loud “I told you so” about the West’s purported longing to bring down Russia.Will the sanctions imposed by the Group of 7 nations truly isolate Russia? No. A number of countries, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and, most significantly, China, remain on friendly terms with Russia. The fact that this list also includes archrivals Pakistan and India, as well as Iran and Israel, illustrates Mr. Putin’s influence as an arms dealer and a power broker in South Asia and the Middle East.The United States could tighten the economic screws on Russia by imposing secondary sanctions. U.S. officials already appear to be threatening as much in meetings and calls with officials in India and China. Secondary sanctions are a powerful tool to compel other countries to get in line with American policy. But the potential benefits need to be weighed against the risks and costs. The extraterritorial application of American laws can also incite deep resentment, even from European allies at times. Secondary sanctions should be used sparingly, and only after consultation with partners.Sanctions can have other unintended consequences as well. They can actually end up strengthening a dictator’s grip on power by tightening state control over the economy. Private businesses can have a hard time weathering the storm of sanctions, but authoritarian regimes and their state-owned enterprises often find ways to circumvent them. Sanctions also provide dictators with a credible external enemy to blame for the misery of their people. Instead of pushing people to rise up against their rulers, sanctions often inspire a rally-around-the-flag effect. After Western sanctions were placed on Russia in 2014, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, 71 percent of Russians saw them as an attempt to “weaken and humiliate Russia,” according to an independent poll.It is also worth remembering that, although Russia’s invasion proves that economic integration is no cure for war, economic isolation is also not a recipe for peace. Sanctions are often sold as an alternative to war. But they can also be a precursor to war, as seen with the institution of the American oil embargo against Japan and the freezing of Japanese assets about five months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.So, while sanctions can hobble economies, they rarely compel the kinds of wholesale political changes that American officials would like to see. Research has shown that they produced some meaningful changes in behavior about 40 percent of the time. Change is unlikely to occur when sanctions are imposed without communicating the steps that must be taken for them to be rolled back.All the more reason that the United States should have a clear plan for how and under what circumstances it would be appropriate to roll back these latest sanctions. Right now, this has been left deliberately vague to allow the Ukrainians to directly negotiate with Russia. It is laudable to give deference to Ukrainians whose lives are on the line in this terrible war. But creating clear goals and communicating benchmarks for sanctions relief are important factors in successful sanctions. Too often, sanctions are left in place for decades, without evaluation of whether or not they are achieving what they were put in place to do.The United States and its allies have been wise in tightening the economic screws on Russia, so long as they bear no illusions about what this can and cannot achieve.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/opinion/sanctions-russia-ukraine-war.html
49,"Two former republics of the Soviet Union — Russia and Ukraine — are once again in conflict.

He had been friendly to Russia’s interests. During the revolution, more than 100 people are killed in protests that centered on the main square in the capital, Kyiv, often called the Maidan.The interim government that follows this pro-Western revolution eventually signs a trade agreement with the European Union that is seen as a first step toward membership in the bloc. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008110602"");

Its independence and sovereignty receive international recognition at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Soviet forces later overthrow independent Ukraine. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is founded in 1921, and Ukraine is subsumed into the Soviet Union the following year.1932 and 1933 — A famine caused by Stalin’s policy of collectivization kills millions of people, mainly ethnic Ukrainians in a republic that is known as the bread basket of the Soviet Union. The disaster is known as the Holodomor, from the Ukrainian word for famine.1939-1944 — The Soviet Union annexes what is now western Ukraine from Poland and Romania. Later, Nazi Germany and the Axis powers invade the Soviet Union and occupy Ukraine, which suffers enormous devastation.1991 — Ukraine declares independence, a move endorsed in a referendum by 92 percent of voters. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus sign an accord recognizing that the Soviet Union has dissolved. Ukraine begins a transition to a market economy, and comes into possession of a significant stockpile of nuclear weapons that had belonged to the Soviet Union.1994 — Under the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine gives up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for a commitment from Moscow “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-timeline.html
50,"KYIV, Ukraine — On Feb. 25, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kolya Rybytva gathered his grandmother and younger sister and left Kyiv “quickly and without unnecessary sentiments,” he said, heading west. His parents and brother stayed behind to help in the war effort.“The decision was made in minutes,” he said, “and it was one of the most difficult in life, but we all understood that war does not provide comfortable solutions.”At the time, Mr. Rybytva, 24, understood that he might never return. But two weeks ago, he did, re-entering Kyiv, the capital, just as Ukrainian forces were starting to push Russian troops out of the suburbs and, eventually, into a full retreat. After a month of artillery attacks that ravaged buildings and had Kyiv residents seeking shelter in the subway stations, a sense of relative calm is being restored.And people like Mr. Rybytva — who also works for the Free Belarus Center, a group dedicated to helping people flee the brutal Lukashenko government in Belarus — are returning to their homes.“The feelings are strange,” he wrote in a series of text messages. “It’s hard to explain. It’s not just a house. It is a symbol. And of course, I really wanted to hug my family and friends.”In Kyiv this week, instead of seeking shelter in the subway, people are now riding it; it is running on all lines, though not all of the stops are open. About 150 buses and 30 trams are working again. The City Council reported that more than 500 businesses had reopened within the last week. The Kyiv school district has started online instruction for students, including those in western Ukraine and locations elsewhere in Europe.ImageKyiv was under curfew last month. Now, lines of cars are forming on highways into the city, a reversal from the first days of the war.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesThere are still checkpoints and barricades on some streets, and sandbags are part of the city’s architecture. But there are also large lines of cars now forming on highways into the city, a reversal from the first days of the war when tens of thousands fled and traffic jams clogged the roads out.The deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Smyrnov, told Ukrainian news media organizations that city officials were considering restarting hearings in the courts because a sufficient number of judges had returned to the capital.Though many residents evacuated Kyiv, others were defiant in staying behind, despite lingering dangers. City officials estimate that close to half of Kyiv’s prewar population of around three million remained in the city.Like Mr. Rybytva’s parents and brother, a large number of those who stayed behind joined an army of volunteer activists, a component so important to Ukraine’s defense that Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, called it the country’s “fourth branch of the military.”Volunteers, including many who in ordinary life were far removed from military matters, provided body armor, bought rifle scopes online and gave them to soldiers. They organized a system of battlefield medical evacuation and set up field kitchens to feed forces at checkpoints.ImageVolunteers weaved camouflage nets for the army last week. Without volunteers, “we would have half of the capacity to fight,” a former secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council said.Credit...Mikhail Palinchak/ReutersThis flurry of volunteer activity highlighted a key difference between the Russian and Ukrainian armies: Russia’s military is top down, while Ukrainian society and even its armed forces are largely organized horizontally, Mr. Danylyuk said.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.“Let me get to the heart of it,” he said. “Volunteers are another force in this war. Without them we would have half of the capacity to fight. Volunteers are doing a phenomenal job, sometimes with risk to their lives. I’m proud of this.”Now, as businesses open up, they are blending support for the army with a return to for-profit activities. Yana Zhadan, a restaurateur and a founder of the Foodies gastronomic group, reopened a pizzeria called Bus Station last weekend. She said her company had been providing free pizza to soldiers and civilians.“I see three main goals in our work,” Ms. Zhadan said in an interview. “To support the company’s employees, to support the city’s economy and livelihood with taxes and utility payments, and volunteering.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes.

In the corridor, which his family used as a shelter, there were blankets scattered on the floor as they had left them, and a board game, “which we tried to distract ourselves with.” There was uneaten soup in the kitchen.Despite the disruption to his life, returning to Kyiv provided a kind of “triumphant feeling,” he said. “But you understand that it is deceptive — victory is far away, security is fragile, and in many parts of the country, everything is getting worse. You are not happy, and you cannot be happy, remembering what happened in the suburbs,” he said, referring to atrocities like those in Bucha.“There is no joy, only anger and indifference, infinite gratitude to all those involved, that you have a place to return to. Pride that Kyiv resisted.”ImageVolunteers using sandbags to fortify a monument in Kyiv last week.

51,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Tuesday that peace talks with Ukraine had reached a “dead end” and he falsely called the evidence of Russian atrocities in a Kyiv suburb “fake,” using his first extended remarks about the war in nearly a month to insist that Russia would persist in its invasion.Speaking at a news conference at a newly built spaceport in Russia’s Far East, Mr. Putin said that Ukraine’s negotiating position at the talks, last held in Istanbul two weeks ago, was unacceptable. He pledged that Russia’s “military operation will continue until its full completion.”But the operation’s goals, he said, centered on the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists have been fighting since 2014. It was the first time that Mr. Putin himself had effectively defined a more limited aim for the war, focusing on control of the Donbas — and not all of Ukraine, which Mr. Putin and his subordinates have said should not even be an independent country.“We will act rhythmically and calmly, according to the plan that was initially proposed by the general staff,” Mr. Putin said. “Our goal is to help the people who live in the Donbas, who feel their unbreakable bond with Russia.”ImageWomen leaving by train at the Sloviansk central station in the Donbas region of Ukraine on Tuesday.

For months leading up to the Feb. 24 invasion, as Russian forces massed on Ukraine’s border, Russian officials insisted there were no plans to invade and that the buildup was merely a military exercise.Ukrainian and Western officials have said they expect that Russia, having failed to seize the capital Kyiv and most other key cities in an invasion hampered by poor logistics, would soon mount an intense offensive in the Donbas, where the Russian military has been pouring in troops.But almost seven weeks into the war, the Russians have yet to conquer Mariupol, the strategically important southern Donbas port that has come to symbolize the death and destruction wrought by the invaders so far. Western officials said they were evaluating unverified accounts that Russian forces may have dropped chemical weapons on a Mariupol steel mill that has become a bastion of Ukrainian army resistance. The use of chemical weapons is a war crime.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, referring to the unverified accounts from Mariupol, said he took them “as seriously as possible.”“Even during the Second World War, the Donbas did not see such cruelty in such a short period of time,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video released early Wednesday. “And from who? From Russian troops.”Russian forces also have repeatedly fired missiles and artillery indiscriminately at civilian targets they have little or no hope of taking, including those in and around the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest. On Tuesday, New York Times journalists witnessed the aftermath of a Russian cluster munitions attack on a Kharkiv suburb that left a trail of casualties, craters and punctured roofs.And the outside pressure on Mr. Putin continued to rise. On Tuesday evening, Ukraine’s security service said it had detained Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian oligarch and politician who is Mr. Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, releasing a photo of him handcuffed and disheveled. President Biden took a new swipe at Mr. Putin, calling him a “dictator” who has committed “genocide,” and a U.S. official said the White House would soon announce new military assistance for Ukraine worth $750 million.ImageAn armored vehicle belonging to pro-Russian separatist forces moving along a street during fighting near the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol on Tuesday.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersMr. Putin’s appearance on Tuesday — coming after several weeks in which the public glimpsed the Russian leader mainly in Kremlin footage showing him holding meetings by videoconference — appeared intended to shore up domestic support for a war with no clear end in sight.Marking Cosmonauts’ Day — the anniversary of the Soviet Cold War triumph in which Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space — Mr. Putin used the new spaceport, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, as his stage.He was accompanied to the spaceport by President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, Mr. Putin’s closest ally, an apparent reminder to Russians that they were not completely isolated in the war.Mr. Putin parried a question from a Russian journalist about the atrocities in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha by retreating into his familiar arguments about Western “double standards.” He claimed that the world had been silent when the United States bombed Syria in the campaign against the Islamic State, and that Mr. Lukashenko had provided evidence that the scenes in Bucha were an orchestrated, British “provocation.”“We discussed in detail this psychological special operation that the English carried out,” Mr. Lukashenko said in a news conference alongside Mr. Putin, referring to Bucha. ImageThis photo released by Russian state media shows Mr. Putin, right, meeting with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus on Tuesday.Credit...Mikhail Klimentyev/SputnikIn fact, independent investigators, including journalists for The New York Times, have documented evidence of numerous execution-style killings, rapes and acts of torture against civilians in Bucha that had been carried out by Russian occupation troops before they retreated last month.But inside Russia, Mr. Putin’s pronouncements are going increasingly unchallenged, with access to Facebook and Instagram and many independent news websites blocked, and a draconian wartime censorship law punishing any deviation from the Kremlin line with as much as 15 years in prison. While prices are rising and layoffs loom as Western companies pull out of Russia, there has been no sign yet of widespread public discontent, and pollsters see significant public support for the war.It was the alliance of Western countries, Mr. Putin insisted, that would soon feel the political backlash from the economic pain wrought by the sanctions, as evidenced by rising prices for food and fuel. European countries, in particular, had shown yet again that they were collectively acting as a “poodle” of the United States, he said.“They always miscalculate, not understanding that in difficult conditions, the Russian people always unite,” Mr. Putin said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Ever since he appeared before tens of thousands at a Moscow stadium on March 18, Mr. Putin’s public appearances have been limited to brief clips showing him meeting with government officials, mostly by video link, in which he does not comment on the peace talks or the war. Instead, he lets his Defense Ministry and other officials do the talking.Mr. Putin emerged from his cocoon on Monday for an off-camera meeting at his residence outside Moscow with Chancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria, the first Western leader to visit with him since the Feb. 24 invasion. Mr. Nehammer said the session left him convinced that Mr. Putin was planning a large and violent military assault on the Donbas.On Tuesday, Mr. Putin arrived in the Amur Region of Russia’s Far East and was shown in video released by the Kremlin chatting informally with workers at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a sprawling facility that has been plagued by construction delays and remains unfinished.While a key initial thrust of Russia’s invasion ended in a retreat, Mr. Putin insisted on Tuesday — as he did in the first weeks of the war — that the plan for what he calls the “special military operation” had not been altered. And he argued that what he called the West’s economic “blitzkrieg” to humble Russia had failed, pointing back to Soviet achievements in the space race as evidence that Russians could thrive despite sanctions.Mr. Putin said Russia would move ahead with its lunar program, which includes a moon lander scheduled to be launched this year. And in a nod to Belarus’s status as Russia’s key ally in the war, Mr. Putin promised to send a Belarusian cosmonaut into space as early as next year.“We are not going to isolate ourselves, and it is generally impossible to isolate anyone in the modern world, and most certainly not as huge a country as Russia,” Mr. Putin said.Western countries have promised to continue to strengthen sanctions against Russia, with Europe increasingly discussing limits on Russian energy imports and more international businesses quitting Russia entirely. On Tuesday, Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications giant, joined its Swedish rival Ericsson in leaving Russia, portending new problems for the country’s internal communications.Mr. Putin offered no hint on Tuesday that he was prepared to make peace before assaulting Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, which Western officials fear could be the most violent phase of the war so far. He insisted, as he has before, that Russia had no choice but to invade, alleging that the West was turning the country into an “anti-Russian bridgehead.”“What is happening in Ukraine is a tragedy,” Mr. Putin said. “They just didn’t leave us a choice. There was no choice.”Reporting was contributed by Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia Yermak from Babai, Ukraine; Ivan Nechepurenko from Istanbul; Marc Santora from Warsaw; and Shashank Bengali and Megan Specia from London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/europe/putin-donbas-war-russia.html
52,"A brief, shaky video uploaded to Telegram on March 17 showed bodies on the ground in Mariupol, one of Ukraine’s largest cities, which has been battered by Russian military attacks in the continuing war. The person behind the camera shouted that it was March 13. But could the date — and the content itself — be corroborated?Christoph Koettl, a senior video journalist on The Times’s Visual Investigations team, was able to cross-reference the video with other footage and satellite imagery, matching architecture, damage and other markers to estimate when and where the video was filmed. After a thorough analysis, he was sure that the video was “absolutely legitimate.”Across the internet, fake videos of the war in Ukraine are popping up, spreading misinformation and, sometimes, propaganda. Often, the videos are from past conflicts: For example, footage from when Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014 has spread online, under the false claim that it’s from the current conflict. Even video game footage has been passed off as real events on platforms such as TikTok.Before The Times can use footage from independent sources for its Ukraine reportage, its reporters and editors make sure they can verify its authenticity. The Visual Investigations team, which produces in-depth video journalism, such as how a U.S. military drone struck the wrong target and an analysis of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, finds and analyzes many of the files.Below, learn how Visual Investigations verifies content from Ukraine.Finding footageThe Visual Investigations team relies on a combination of open-source reporting — the use of publicly available information — and more traditional, on-the-ground journalism from Times reporters in Ukraine and other trusted sources for videos from Ukraine.Times reporters and editors regularly scour social media sites like Telegram, Facebook and Twitter, searching for keywords and locations to find videos or images from the war.“I would say more than 75 percent of the information that I’m looking at is on Telegram,” said Evan Hill, a reporter for Visual Investigations. The messaging app is popular in Russia and Eastern Europe, much like WhatsApp is in other parts of the world.The team pores over dozens of videos each day. When one appears to have merit, reporters and editors take a closer look.Confirming that a file is currentTo confirm that the footage is current, the team runs stills through Google Images or Yandex, a Russian search engine. This process is called reverse image searching. If the material has appeared online before, it will very likely show up in the search.Having some familiarity with important buildings, uniform insignia or even the artillery being fired can also help when trying to figure out whether a video is authentic.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 12:06 p.m. ETIn India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.For years, the U.S. sent mixed signals about its interests in Ukraine. Then Putin made his move.Fires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.“I have worked with a lot of footage from ’14 and ’15,” said Dmitriy Khavin, a senior video editor, referring to the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict. Flags, he said, help indicate if the footage he’s reviewing is old or new. “What flags were they flying then? I know they’re not flying these flags now.”The team takes note of specific markers. For example, in the current conflict, Russian forces have marked their vehicles with a Z or V — a unique “giveaway,” said Mr. Koettl, that footage is from the current war and not the conflict in 2014.If the team determines that a video is fake, it alerts other Times staff members and posts comments on social channels to warn users that the content is unreliable.Pinpointing the location and dateNext, the team must verify the date and location of a video. Comparing landmarks or matching structural damage with visual references such as satellite images or other photos and videos, as Mr. Koettl did for the Mariupol footage, often provides enough context to pinpoint a precise area.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.That process can also involve using both satellite imagery and social media posts. High resolution satellite imagery may be pulled from tools like Google Earth, or are acquired from private space imaging companies. Websites that provide satellite images collected by intergovernmental organizations are another source. Some of these resources have older images, but they can still be helpful “in establishing where something was filmed so that we can confirm or poke holes in what’s being alleged,” said Haley Willis, a reporter for Visual Investigations.The Visual Investigations team used satellite imagery to determine that Russia was staging troops at Ukraine’s border to prepare for an invasion: A satellite image of a field hospital gave an early indication that Russia was preparing for something other than a military exercise.Determining “when something was filmed is much more difficult,” Ms. Willis said, “especially when stuff is happening every single day.”To verify a precise time, the Visual Investigations team uses websites like SunCalc, which estimates a time of day a photo was taken by measuring the length of shadows in the image. Matching the image to CCTV and security camera footage can also help, since that footage includes a date and time stamp, although those time stamps are not always 100 percent accurate, Ms. Willis said.Using the video to inform reportingAfter these steps, which can be relatively quick or take several hours, depending on the video, Visual Investigations updates The Times’s live blog on the war and uses the material for its own reporting.“We’ve got so much stuff that we want to get out there, and the blog, as of right now, is the best way to do that,” Mr. Hill said. “Now we’re trying to figure out what are the bigger stories that we can bite off and cover.”VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/2:32-0:00transcriptTracking Russia’s Latest Military Movements Around UkraineVideos, satellite images and social media posts reveal the scale and intensity of Russia’s military deployments near Ukraine’s border.U.S. officials are warning that Russia could invade Ukraine in a matter of days. Russia says its buildup of troops and weapons is part of planned military exercises. Satellite images, social media videos and photos show the scale and intensity of some of Russia’s latest deployments. The situation is volatile, and Russia’s military movements continue to cause fear and confusion. Satellite imagery from Sunday shows the arrival of new equipment, and vehicles being repositioned at a site just 17 miles from Ukraine. U.S. officials and independent military experts say at least half of Russia’s battalion tactical groups, which are designed for ground combat, have been deployed near Ukraine. Vehicles transporting short-range ballistic missile systems called Iskanders appear to be moving closer to the border, as seen here in Western Russia in February. Satellite images show that these types of weapons were also moved to a site in Belarus in January, putting them within range of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. And in mid-February, there was a new addition to the site: a field hospital. Another field hospital was also set up in Crimea, the part of Ukraine that was seized by Russia in 2014. In the same area, satellite images show a new camp for troops, which could indicate a higher level of military readiness.

53,"WASHINGTON — President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculated move on Wednesday to test-launch a new intercontinental ballistic missile, declaring it a warning to those in the West who “try to threaten our country,” fed into a growing concern inside the Biden administration: that Russia is now so isolated from the rest of the world that Mr. Putin sees little downside to provocative actions.Even before the missile launch, American officials and foreign leaders were weighing whether their success in cutting Russia off from much of the global economy, making it a diplomatic pariah, could further fuel Mr. Putin’s willingness to assert his country’s strength. The first launch of the nuclear-capable Sarmat missile was just the latest example of how he has tried to remind the world of his capabilities — in space, in cyberspace and along the coast of Europe — despite early setbacks on the ground in Ukraine.“He is now in his own war logic,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria said last week after meeting with Mr. Putin in Russia. He described the Russian president as more determined than ever to counter what he sees as a growing threat from the West and to recapture Russia’s sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, said last week that “every day, Putin demonstrates that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising ones,” adding that his “risk appetite has grown as his grip on Russia has tightened.”In private, American officials have been more direct about the potential for an isolated Russian leader to lash out in further destabilizing ways. “We have been so successful in disconnecting Putin from the global system that he has even more incentive to disrupt it beyond Ukraine,” one senior intelligence official said in a recent conversation, insisting on anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. “And if he grows increasingly desperate, he may try things that don’t seem rational.”Mr. Putin, assessments delivered to the White House have concluded, believes he is winning, according to a senior American official who asked for anonymity to discuss intelligence findings.He is certainly acting that way.It is hardly surprising that Mr. Putin has not backed down in the face of economic sanctions and measures to cut off his country from technology needed for new weapons and now some consumer goods. He has often shrugged off Western sanctions, arguing he can easily manage around them.“We can already confidently say that this policy toward Russia has failed,” Mr. Putin said on Monday. “The strategy of an economic blitzkrieg has failed.”He was immediately contradicted by his own central bank chief, Elvira Nabiullina. “At the moment, perhaps this problem is not yet so strongly felt, because there are still reserves in the economy,” she said. “But we see that sanctions are being tightened almost every day,” she continued, adding that “the period during which the economy can live on reserves is finite.”ImageA rocket barrage slammed into the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv this week, lighting apartment buildings and a market on fire. Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBut that reality apparently has not sunk in. If anything, Mr. Putin has grown more belligerent, focusing new fire on Mariupol as Russian forces seek to secure all of the Donbas region in the coming weeks. He has insisted to visitors like Mr. Nehammer that he remains determined to achieve his goals.While Russian casualties have been high and Mr. Putin’s ambitions have narrowed in Ukraine, American intelligence assessments have concluded that the Russian president believes that the West’s efforts to punish him and contain Russia’s power will crack over time. With the help of China, India and other nations in Asia, he appears to believe he can avoid true isolation, just as he did after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.Now, American officials are girding for what increasingly feels like a long, grinding confrontation, and they have encountered repeated reminders by Mr. Putin that the world is messing with a nuclear weapons power and should tread carefully.On Wednesday, after providing warnings to the Pentagon that a missile test was coming — a requirement of the New START treaty, which has four years remaining — Mr. Putin declared that the launch should “provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country.”In fact, the missile, if deployed, would add only marginally to Russia’s capabilities. But the launch was about timing and symbolism: It came amid the recent public warnings, including by Mr. Burns, that there was a small but growing chance that Mr. Putin might turn to chemical weapons attacks, or even a demonstration nuclear detonation.If Mr. Putin turns his sights on the United States or its allies, the assumption has always been that Russia would make use of its cyberarsenal to retaliate for the effects of sanctions on the Russian economy. But eight weeks into the conflict, there have been no significant cyberattacks beyond the usual background noise of daily Russian cyberactivity in American networks, including ransomware attacks.U.S. officials have been warning financial firms, utilities and others for six months to prepare themselves, and there is a growing body of evidence that U.S. Cyber Command and its equivalents in Britain and elsewhere have taken modest pre-emptive actions against the Russian intelligence agencies that are most active in cyberspace.“If the Russians attack the West, NATO or the United States, that’s a fraught decision that has dire consequences on both sides,” Chris Inglis, the United States’ first national cyber director, said on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.Mr. Inglis said that American government agencies and businesses had been provided ample “strategic warning” and were in a far better position to repel or recover from such attacks than they would have been a year ago.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.But for all those threats, the American position has been to keep amping up the pressure on Mr. Putin — from sanctions to diplomatic isolation to the provision of more powerful weapons to the Ukrainian military. “Ukraine already won the battle for Kyiv,” one administration official said. He added that the administration would “continue to provide Ukraine with an enormous amount of arms, training and intel” so that it “could keep winning.”It is far from clear that the Ukrainians will keep winning now that the fight has moved away from the urban streets of Kyiv to more familiar, flatter ground in the Donbas.Nor is it clear exactly what would lead the administration to back away from the ever-tightening pressure on Russia.The administration’s public position is that none of the sanctions are permanent and that they were carefully crafted so they could be used at any moment as a source of leverage in a diplomatic resolution of the war. Presumably that would require Russia to pull all its forces out of Ukraine and cease hostilities in what Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken calls an “irreversible” way.Right now, there is no prospect of that on the horizon. The attacks, one administration official noted recently, are more barbaric than ever and seem poised to escalate. But the effects of the sanctions seem likely to become harsher as well.ImageA photo released by Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, shows the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile being launched from Plesetsk, Russia, on Wednesday.Speaking at the Georgia Institute of Technology last week, Mr. Burns, a former American ambassador to Moscow, said Mr. Putin was “an apostle of payback” who believes the West “took advantage of Russia’s moment of historical weakness in the 1990s.” He added that Mr. Putin’s small circle of advisers would hesitate to “question his judgment or his stubborn, almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russia’s sphere of influence.”That means getting the West to back away from Russia’s borders. And it means stopping NATO’s expansion, which may soon spread to Finland and Sweden, where a senior American defense official was visiting this week to discuss possible accession to the Western alliance.At the beginning of the Ukraine war, Mr. Putin publicly ordered his nuclear forces on higher alert status as a signal of Russia’s power, though Mr. Burns has said there is no evidence that the forces actually went on heightened alert.The test on Wednesday of the Sarmat missile, in development for years, was another mixed signal. While Mr. Putin described it as “capable of overcoming all modern means of antimissile defense,” arms experts say that is hyperbole. But the hyperbole fits into a pattern.Historians of the Cold War point out that little of this is new. George F. Kennan, the architect of “containment strategy” — the effort to limit Soviet power — always warned that containment had its limits. “His concern,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian who has written extensively about that era, was that “if they become a pariah nation, you don’t have very much influence on them.”Over the next few months, that may become President Biden’s concern as well.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/us/politics/russia-putin-missile-test.html

Putin addressed the German Parliament on Sept. 25, 2001. “Russia is a friendly European nation,” he declared. “Stable peace on the continent is a paramount goal for our nation.”The Russian leader, elected the previous year at the age of 47 after a meteoric rise from obscurity, went on to describe “democratic rights and freedoms” as the “key goal of Russia’s domestic policy.” Members of the Bundestag gave a standing ovation, moved by the reconciliation Mr. Putin seemed to embody in a city, Berlin, that long symbolized division between the West and the totalitarian Soviet world.Norbert Röttgen, a center-right representative who headed the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee for several years, was among those who rose to their feet. “Putin captured us,” he said. “The voice was quite soft, in German, a voice that tempts you to believe what is said to you. We had some reason to think there was a viable perspective of togetherness.”Today, all togetherness shredded, Ukraine burns, bludgeoned by the invading army Mr. Putin sent to prove his conviction that Ukrainian nationhood is a myth. More than 3.7 million Ukrainians are refugees; the dead mount up in a month-old war; and that purring voice of Mr. Putin has morphed into the angry rant of a hunched man dismissing as “scum and traitors” any Russian who resists the violence of his tightening dictatorship.ImageThe Retroville Mall in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was in ruins after being shelled by Russian forces this week.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesImageA refugee family from Ukraine arriving at a train station in Budapest this month.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesHis opponents, a “fifth column” manipulated by the West, will meet an ugly fate, Mr. Putin vowed this month, grimacing as his planned blitzkrieg in Ukraine stalled. True Russians, he said, would “spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths” and so achieve “a necessary self-purification of society.”This was less the language of Kant than of fascist nationalist exaltation laced with Mr. Putin’s hardscrabble, brawling St. Petersburg youth.Between these voices of reason and incitation, between these two seemingly different men, lie 22 years of power and five American presidents. As China rose, as America fought and lost its forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as technology networked the world, a Russian enigma took form in the Kremlin.Did the United States and its allies, through excess of optimism or naïveté, simply get Mr. Putin wrong from the outset? Or was he transformed over time into the revanchist warmonger of today, whether because of perceived Western provocation, gathering grievance, or the giddying intoxication of prolonged and — since Covid-19 — increasingly isolated rule?Mr. Putin is an enigma, but he is also the most public of figures. Seen from the perspective of his reckless gamble in Ukraine, a picture emerges of a man who seized on almost every move by the West as a slight against Russia — and perhaps also himself. As the grievances mounted, piece by piece, year by year, the distinction blurred. In effect, he became the state, he merged with Russia, their fates fused in an increasingly Messianic vision of restored imperial glory.From the Ashes of Empire“The temptation of the West for Putin was, I think, chiefly that he saw it as instrumental to building a great Russia,” said Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state who met several times with Mr. Putin during the first phase of his rule. “He was always obsessed with the 25 million Russians trapped outside Mother Russia by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Again and again he raised this. That is why, for him, the end of the Soviet empire was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century.”But if irredentist resentment lurked, alongside a Soviet spy’s suspicion of the United States, Mr. Putin had other initial priorities. He was a patriotic servant of the state. The post-communist Russia of the 1990s, led by Boris N. Yeltsin, the country’s first freely elected leader, had sundered.In 1993, Mr. Yeltsin ordered the Parliament shelled to put down an insurgency; 147 people were killed. The West had to provide Russia with humanitarian aid, so dire was its economic collapse, so pervasive its extreme poverty, as large swaths of industry were sold off for a song to an emergent class of oligarchs. All this, to Mr. Putin, represented mayhem. It was humiliation.ImageProtesters climbed onto tanks in Moscow in August 1991 after Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, was briefly removed from power by hardliners.Credit...Boris Yurchenko/Associated PressImageIn 1993, Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Putin’s predecessor, ordered Russia’s Parliament shelled to put down an insurgency.Credit...Sergei Karpukhin/Associated Press“He hated what happened to Russia, hated the idea the West had to help it,” said Christoph Heusgen, the chief diplomatic adviser to former Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany between 2005 and 2017. Mr. Putin’s first political manifesto for the 2000 presidential campaign was all about reversing Western efforts to transfer power from the state to the marketplace. “For Russians,” he wrote, “a strong state is not an anomaly to fight against.” Quite the contrary, “it is the source and guarantor of order, the initiator and the main driving force of any change.”But Mr. Putin was no Marxist, even if he reinstated the Stalin-era national anthem. He had seen the disaster of a centralized planned economy, both in Russia and East Germany, where he served as a K.G.B. agent between 1985 and 1990.The new president would work with the oligarchs created by chaotic, free-market, crony capitalism — so long as they showed absolute fealty. Failing that, they would be expunged. If this was democracy, it was “sovereign democracy,” a phrase embraced by Mr. Putin’s top political strategists, stress on the first word.Marked, to some degree, by his home city of St. Petersburg, built by Peter the Great in the early 18th century as a “window to Europe,” and by his initial political experience there from 1991 working in the mayor’s office to attract foreign investment, Mr. Putin does appear to have been guardedly open to the West early in his rule.He mentioned the possibility of Russian membership of NATO to President Bill Clinton in 2000, an idea that never went anywhere. He maintained a Russian partnership agreement signed with the European Union in 1994. A NATO-Russia Council was established in 2002. Petersburg man vied with Homo Sovieticus.This was a delicate balancing act, for which the disciplined Mr. Putin was prepared. “You should never lose control,” he told the American movie director Oliver Stone in “The Putin Interviews,” a 2017 documentary. He once described himself as “an expert in human relations.” German lawmakers were not alone in being seduced by this man of impassive features and implacable intent, honed as an intelligence operative.“You must understand, he is from the K.G.B., lying is his profession, it is not a sin,” said Sylvie Bermann, the French ambassador in Moscow from 2017 to 2020. “He is like a mirror, adapting to what he sees, in the way he was trained.”A few months before the Bundestag speech, Mr. Putin famously won over President George W. Bush, who, after their first meeting in June 2001, said he had looked into the Russian president’s eyes, gotten “a sense of his soul” and found him “very straightforward and trustworthy.” Mr. Yeltsin, similarly swayed, anointed Mr. Putin as his successor just three years after he arrived in Moscow in 1996.ImageMr. Putin, then the prime minister, with Mr. Yeltsin as he left the Kremlin in 1999.Credit...TASS, via Getty ImagesImage“Stable peace on the continent is a paramount goal for our nation,” Mr. Putin told German lawmakers in 2001. Credit...Fritz Reiss/Associated Press“Putin orients himself very precisely to a person,” Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man before he served a decade in a Siberian penal colony and had his company forcibly broken up, told me in an interview in 2016 in Washington. “If he wants you to like him, you will like him.”The previous time I had seen Mr. Khodorkovsky, in Moscow in October 2003, was just days before his arrest by armed agents on embezzlement charges. He had been talking to me then about his bold political ambitions — a lèse-majesté unacceptable to Mr. Putin.An Authoritarian’s RiseThe wooded presidential estate outside Moscow was comfortable but not ornate. In 2003, Mr. Putin’s personal tastes did not yet run to palatial grandiosity. Security guards lounged around, gawking at TVs showing fashion models on the runways of Milan and Paris.Mr. Putin, as he likes to do, kept us waiting for many hours. It seemed a small demonstration of one-upmanship, a minor incivility he would inflict even on Ms. Rice, similar to bringing his dog into a meeting with Ms. Merkel in 2007 when he knew she was scared of dogs.“I understand why he has to do this,” Ms. Merkel said. “To prove he’s a man.”When the interview with three New York Times journalists at last began, Mr. Putin was cordial and focused, comfortable in his strong command of detail. “We firmly stand on the path of development of democracy and of a market economy,” he said, adding, “By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans.”He spoke of “good, close relations” with the Bush administration, despite the Iraq war, and said “the main principles of humanism — human rights, freedom of speech — remain fundamental for all countries.” The greatest lesson of his education, he said, was “respect for the law.”At this time, Mr. Putin had already clamped down on independent media; prosecuted a brutal war in Chechnya involving the leveling of Grozny, its capital; and placed security officials — known as siloviki — front and center in his governance. Often, they were old St. Petersburg buddies, like Nikolai Patrushev, now the secretary of Mr. Putin’s security council. The first rule of an intelligence officer is suspicion.ImageGrozny, Chechnya’s capital, in 2000.

Michel Eltchaninoff, the French author of “Inside the Mind of Vladimir Putin,” said there was “a varnish of liberalism to his discourse in the early 2000s,” but the pull of restoring Russian imperial might, and so avenging Russia’s perceived relegation to what President Barack Obama would call “a regional power,” was always Mr. Putin’s deepest urge.Born in 1952 in a city then called Leningrad, Mr. Putin grew up in the shadow of the Soviets’ war with Nazi Germany, known to Russians as the Great Patriotic War. His father was badly wounded, an older brother died during the brutal 872-day German siege of the city, and a grandfather had worked for Stalin as a cook. The immense sacrifices of the Red Army in defeating Nazism were not abstract but palpable within his modest family, as for many Russians of his generation. Mr. Putin learned young that, as he put it, “the weak get beat.”“The West did not take sufficient account of the strength of Soviet myth, military sacrifice and revanchism in him,” Mr. Eltchaninoff, whose grandparents were all Russian, said. “He believes deeply that Russian man is prepared to sacrifice himself for an idea, whereas Western man likes success and comfort.”ImageThe Motherland Calls, a statue in Volgograd, Russia, commemorates soldiers killed in the Battle of Stalingrad.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesImageStalingrad in the fall of 1942. “The Great Patriotic War,” as World War II is known in Russia, plays an outsize role in the country’s political mythmaking. Credit... Sovfoto/Universal Images Group, via Getty ImagesMr. Putin brought a measure of that comfort to Russia in the first eight years of his presidency. The economy galloped ahead, foreign investment poured in. “It was perhaps the happiest time in the country’s life, with a measure of prosperity and level of freedom never matched in Russian history,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center.Mr. Gabuev, who, like thousands of liberal Russians, has fled to Istanbul since the war in Ukraine began, added that “there was a lot of corruption and concentration of wealth, but also lots of boats rising. And remember, in the 1990s, everyone had been poor as a church mouse.” Now the middle class could vacation in Turkey or Vietnam.The problem for Mr. Putin was that to diversify an economy, the rule of law helps. He had studied law at St. Petersburg University and claimed to respect it. In fact, power proved to be his lodestone. He held legal niceties in contempt. “Why would he share power when he could live off oil, gas, other natural resources, and enough redistribution to keep people happy?” Mr. Gabuev said.Timothy Snyder, the prominent historian of fascism, put it this way: “Having toyed with an authoritarian rule-of-law state, he simply become the oligarch-in-chief and turned the state into the enforcer mechanism of his oligarchical clan.”Still, the biggest country on earth, stretching across 11 time zones, needed more than economic recovery to stand tall once more. Mr. Putin had been formed in a Soviet world that held that Russia was not a great power unless it dominated its neighbors. Rumblings at the country’s doorstep challenged that doctrine.In November 2003, the Rose Revolution in Georgia set that country firmly on a Western course. In 2004 — the year of NATO’s second post-Cold War expansion, which brought in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — massive street protests, known as the Orange Revolution, erupted in Ukraine. They, too, stemmed from a rejection of Moscow and the embrace of a Western future.ImageA demonstration in Tbilisi, Georgia, in November 2003. Georgia’s tilt toward the West angered Mr. Putin.

It would be slow but the general direction was set. Once, asked by Ms. Merkel what his greatest mistake had been, the Russian president replied: “To trust you.”A Clash With the WestFrom 2004 onward, a distinct hardening of Mr. Putin’s Russia — what Ms. Rice, the former secretary of state, called “a crackdown where they were starting to spin these tales of vulnerability and democratic contagion” — became evident.The president scrapped elections for regional governors in late 2004, turning them into Kremlin appointees. Russian TV increasingly looked like Soviet TV in its undiluted propaganda.In 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist critical of rights abuses in Chechnya, was murdered in Moscow on Mr. Putin’s birthday. Another Kremlin critic, Alexander Litvinenko, a former intelligence agent, who had dubbed Russia “a mafia state,” was killed in London, poisoned with a radioactive substance by Russian spies.ImageA memorial service in 2007 commemorating the first anniversary of the slaying of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.Credit...Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated PressImageThe funeral for Alexander Litvinenko, a former intelligence agent poisoned by Russian spies, in London in 2006.Credit...Cathal McNaughton/ReutersFor Mr. Putin, NATO expansion into countries that had been part of the Soviet Union or its postwar East European imperium represented an American betrayal. But the threat of a successful Western democracy on his doorstep appears to have evolved into a more immediate perceived threat to his increasingly repressive system.“Putin’s nightmare is not NATO, but democracy,” said Joschka Fischer, a former German foreign minister who met with Mr. Putin several times. “It’s the color revolutions, thousands of people on the streets of Kyiv. Once he embraced an imperial, military ideology as the foundation of Russia as a world power, he was unable to tolerate this.”Although Mr. Putin has portrayed a West-leaning Ukraine as a threat to Russian security, it was more immediately a threat to Putin’s authoritarian system itself. Radek Sikorski, the former Polish foreign minister, said: “Putin is of course right that a democratic Ukraine integrated with Europe and successful is a mortal threat to Putinism. That, more than NATO membership, is the issue.”The Russian president does not take well to mortal threats, real or imagined. If anyone had doubted Mr. Putin’s ruthlessness, they stood corrected by 2006. His loathing of weakness dictated a proclivity for violence. Yet Western democracies were slow to absorb this basic lesson.They needed Russia, and not only for its oil and gas. The Russian president, who was the first to call President Bush after 9/11, was an important potential ally in what came to be called the Global War on Terror. It meshed with his own war in Chechnya and with a tendency to see himself as part of a civilizational battle on behalf of Christianity.ImageMr. Putin with President George W. Bush in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in June 2001. At left is Condoleezza Rice, then Mr. Bush’s national security adviser.

In every stirring for liberty, Mr. Putin now saw the hidden hand of the United States. And why would Mr. Bush not include Russia in his ambitious program?Arriving in Moscow as the U.S. ambassador in 2005, William Burns, now the C.I.A. director, sent a sober cable, all post-Cold War optimism dispelled. “Russia is too big, too proud, and too self-conscious of its own history to fit neatly into a ‘Europe whole and free,’” he wrote. As he relates in his memoir, “The Back Channel,” Mr. Burns added that Russian “interest in playing a distinctive Great Power role” would “sometimes cause significant problems.”When François Hollande, the former French president, met Mr. Putin several years later, he was surprised to find him referring to Americans as “Yankees” — and in scathing terms. These Yankees had “humiliated us, put us in second position,” Mr. Putin told him. NATO was an organization “aggressive by its nature,” used by the United States to put Russia under pressure, even to stir democracy movements.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.“He expressed himself in a cold and calculating way,” Mr. Hollande said. “He is a man who always wants to demonstrate a kind of implacable determination, but also in the form of seduction, almost gentleness. An agreeable tone alternates with brutal outbursts, which are thereby made more effective.”The more assured he grew in his power, the more Mr. Putin appears to have reverted to the hostility toward the United States in which he was formed. The NATO bombing of Belgrade in 1999 during the Kosovo War, and the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, had already given him a healthy distrust of American invocations of the United Nations Charter and international law. Convinced of the exceptionalism of Russia, its inevitable fate to be a great power, he could not abide American exceptionalism, the perception of America throwing its power around in the name of some unique destiny, an inherent mission to spread freedom in a world where the United States was the sole hegemon.These grudges came to a head in Mr. Putin’s ferocious speech in 2007 to the Munich Security Conference. “One state and, of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way,” he declared to a shocked audience. A “unipolar world” had been imposed after the Cold War with “one center of authority, one center of force, one center of decision-making.”ImageMr. Putin in February 2007.

Ms. Merkel, raised in East Germany, a Russian speaker, had formed a relationship with him. Mr. Putin put his two children in Moscow’s German school after his return from Dresden. He liked to quote from German poems. “There was an affinity,” said Mr. Heusgen, her top diplomatic adviser. “An understanding.”Working with Mr. Putin could not mean dictating to him, however. “We deeply believed it would not be good to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO,” Mr. Heusgen said. “They would bring instability.” Article 10 of the NATO Treaty, as Mr. Heusgen noted, says any new member must be in a position to “contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.” Just how the two contested countries would do that was unclear to Ms. Merkel.The United States, however, with the Bush presidency in its last year, was in no mood to compromise. Mr. Bush wanted a “Membership Action Plan,” or MAP, for Ukraine and Georgia, a specific commitment to bringing the two countries into the alliance, to be announced at the April 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest. NATO expansion had ensured the security and freedom of 100 million Europeans liberated from the totalitarian Soviet imperium; it should not stop.Mr. Burns, as ambassador, was opposed. In a then-classified message to Ms. Rice, he wrote: “Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin’s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.”Already, in February 2008, the United States and many of its allies had recognized the independence of Kosovo from Serbia, a unilateral declaration rejected as illegal by Russia and seen as an affront to a fellow Slav nation. Ms. Bermann, the former French ambassador to Moscow, recalled Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, warning her at the time: “Be careful, it’s a precedent, it will be used against you.”France joined Germany in Bucharest in opposing the MAP for Georgia and Ukraine. “Germany wanted nothing,” Ms. Rice recalled. “It said you could not take in a country with a frozen conflict like Georgia” — an allusion to the tense standoff between Georgia and the breakaway, Russian-backed, self-declared republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.To which Mr. Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, retorted: “You were a frozen conflict for 45 years!”The compromise was messy. The NATO leaders’ declaration said that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO.” But it stopped short of endorsing an action plan that would make such membership possible. Ukraine and Georgia were left with an empty promise, consigned to drift indefinitely in a strategic no man’s land, while Russia was at once angered and offered a glimpse of a division it could later exploit.“Today we look at the statement and think it was the worst of all worlds,” said Thomas Bagger, the departing senior diplomatic adviser to the German president.ImageA Russian armored personnel carrier rolled through Senaki, Georgia, in August 2008.Credit...Joseph Sywenkyj for The New York TimesImageAn apartment in Gori, Georgia, after it was hit by a Russian shell.Credit...Joao Silva for The New York TimesMr. Putin came to Bucharest and delivered what Ms. Rice described as an “emotional speech,” suggesting Ukraine was a made-up country, noting the presence of 17 million Russians there, and calling Kyiv the mother of all Russian cities — a claim that would develop into an obsession.To Mr. Sikorski, Mr. Putin’s speech was not surprising. He had received a letter that year from Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a fierce Russian nationalist who was then the deputy speaker of the Duma, suggesting that Poland and Russia simply partition Ukraine. “I did not respond,” Mr. Sikorski said. “We are not in the business of changing borders.”Still, for all the differences, Mr. Putin had not yet hardened into outright hostility. President Bush and Ms. Rice proceeded to Mr. Putin’s favored resort of Sochi on the Black Sea Coast.Mr. Putin showed off the sites planned for the 2014 Winter Olympics. He introduced them to Dmitri A. Medvedev, his longtime associate who would become president in May, as part of a choreographed maneuver to respect Russian’s constitutional term limits but allow Mr. Putin to return to the Kremlin in 2012 after a spell as prime minister.There were Cossack dancers. Some Americans danced and the mood there was very good.Three months later, a five-day war erupted in Georgia. Russia called it a “peace enforcement” operation. Having provoked an impetuous Georgian attack on its proxy forces in South Ossetia, Russia invaded Georgia. Its strategic goal was to neutralize any ambitions for Georgian NATO membership; this was largely achieved. Moscow recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, integrating them into Russia.Mr. Putin, in his deliberate manner, had drawn a first line in the sand, with no meaningful Western response.Us Versus ThemOn May 7, 2012, as a 30-gun salute echoed over Moscow and riot police officers in camouflage rounded up protesters, Mr. Putin returned to the Russian presidency. Bristling and increasingly convinced of Western perfidy and decadence, he was in many respects a changed man.ImageRiot police dispersed demonstrators in downtown Moscow protesting Mr. Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev/Associated PressImageSupporters of Mr. Putin in Moscow in February 2012.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesThe outbreak of large street protests five months earlier, with marchers bearing signs that said “Putin is a thief,” had cemented his conviction that the United States was determined to bring a color revolution to Russia. The demonstrations erupted after parliamentary elections in December 2011 that were widely viewed as fraudulent by domestic and international observers. The unrest was eventually crushed.Mr. Putin accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of being the primary instigator. “She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,” he said. Ms. Clinton retorted that, in line with America’s values, “we expressed concerns that we thought were well founded about the conduct of the elections.”So much for the Obama administration’s attempts at a “reset” in relations with Russia over the four years that the milder Mr. Medvedev, who was always beholden to Mr. Putin, spent in office.Still, the idea that Mr. Putin posed any serious threat to American interests was largely dismissed in a Washington focused on defeating Al Qaeda. After Gov. Mitt Romney said that the biggest geopolitical threat facing the United States was Russia, he was mocked by President Obama.“The Cold War’s been over for 20 years,” Mr. Obama said by way of contemptuous instruction during a 2012 presidential debate.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Russia, under American pressure, had abstained in a 2011 United Nations Security Council vote for military intervention in Libya, which authorized “all necessary measures” to protect civilians. When this mission, in Mr. Putin’s perception, morphed into the pursuit of the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who was killed by Libyan forces, the Russian president was furious. This was yet further confirmation of America’s international lawlessness.Something else was at work. “He was haunted by the brutal takeout of Qaddafi,” said Mark Medish, who was senior director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council during the Clinton presidency. “I was told that he replayed the videos again and again.” The elimination of a dictator felt personal.Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador to Syria and now a special adviser to the Institut Montaigne think tank in Paris, places Mr. Putin’s definitive “choice of repolarization” in 2012. China had risen, offering new strategic options. “He had become convinced that the West was in decline after the 2008 financial crisis,” Mr. Duclos said. “The way forward now was confrontation.”In this clash, Mr. Putin had armed himself with cultural and religious reinforcements. He cast himself as the macho embodiment of conservative Orthodox Christian values against the West’s irreligious embrace of same-sex marriage, radical feminism, homosexuality, mass immigration and other manifestations of “decadence.”ImageMr. Putin has refashioned himself as a champion of Orthodox Christianity.Credit...Pool photo by Alexei NikolskyImageMembers of the activist group Pussy Riot in a Moscow courtroom in 2012.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev/Associated PressThe United States and its allies, in Mr. Putin’s telling, were intent on globalizing these subversive values under cover of democracy promotion and human rights. Saint Russia would stand against this baleful homogenization. Putinism, as it was now fleshed out, stood against a godless and insinuating West. Moscow had an ideology once more. It was one of conservative resistance, and it appealed to rightist leaders across Europe and beyond.It was also, it seems, a reflection of something more. When, in the Oliver Stone documentary, Mr. Putin is asked if he ever has “bad days,” his response is: “I am not a woman, so I don’t have bad days.” Pressed a little by the generally deferential Mr. Stone, the Russian president opines, “That’s just the nature of things.”Later, Mr. Stone asks about gays and the military. “If you are taking a shower in a submarine with a man and you know he is gay, do you have a problem with that?” Mr. Putin replies: “Well, I prefer not to go to the shower with him. Why provoke him? But you know, I’m a judo master.”This, apparently, was meant as a joke.But Mr. Putin was not joking about his conservative challenge to Western culture. It allowed him to develop his own support in Europe among hard-right parties like the French National Rally, formerly the National Front, that received a loan from a Russian bank. Autocratic nationalism revived its appeal, challenging the democratic liberalism that the Russian leader would pronounce “obsolete” in 2019.A number of fascist or nationalist writers and historians with mystical ideas of Russian destiny and fate, prominent among them Ivan Ilyin, increasingly influenced Mr. Putin’s thinking. Ilyin saw the Russian soldier as “the will, the force and the honor of the Russian state” and wrote, “My prayer is like a sword. And my sword is like a prayer.” Mr. Putin took to citing him frequently.“By the time Putin returns to the Kremlin he has an ideology, a spiritual cover for his kleptocracy,” said Mr. Snyder, the historian. “Russia now extends however far its leader decides. It’s all about eternal Russia, a mash-up of the last 1,000 years. Ukraine is ours, always ours, because God says so, and never mind the facts.”When Mr. Putin traveled to Kyiv in July 2013, on a visit to mark the 1,025th anniversary of the conversion to Christianity of Prince Vladimir of the Kyivan Rus, he vowed to protect “our common Fatherland, Great Rus.” Later he would have a statue of Vladimir erected in front of the Kremlin.For Ukraine, however, such Russian “protection” had become little more than a thinly veiled threat, whatever the extensive cultural, linguistic and family ties between the two countries.“Poland has been invaded many times by Russia,” Mr. Sikorski, the former Polish foreign minister, said. “But remember, Russia never invades. It just comes to the assistance of endangered Russian-speaking minorities.”A Leader EmboldenedThe 22-year arc of Mr. Putin’s exercise of power is in many ways a study of growing audacity. Intent at first at restoring order in Russia and gaining international respect — especially in the West — he became convinced that a Russia rich in oil revenue and new high-tech weaponry could strut the world, deploy military force and meet scant resistance.“Power, for the Russians, is arms. It is not the economy,” said Ms. Bermann, the former French ambassador, who closely followed Mr. Putin’s steady militarization of Russian society during her time in Moscow. She was particularly struck by the grandiose video display of advanced nuclear and hypersonic weaponry presided over by the president in a March 2018 address to the nation.ImageArmored vehicles in the streets of Moscow last May in preparation for Victory Day, which commemorates the defeat of Nazi Germany.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesImageRussian military cadets training in 2018.Credit...Konstantin Chalabov for The New York Times“Nobody listened to us,” Mr. Putin proclaimed. “Listen to us now.” He also said, “Efforts to contain Russia have failed.”If Mr. Putin was, as he now seemed to believe, the personification of Russia’s mystical great-power destiny, all constraints were off. “When I first met him you had to lean in a little to understand what he was saying,” said Ms. Rice, the former secretary of state. “I’ve seen Putin go from a little shy, to pretty shy, to arrogant, and now megalomaniacal.”An important moment in this development appears to have come with Mr. Obama’s last-minute decision in 2013 not to bomb Syria after Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, crossed an American “red line” against using chemical weapons. Mr. Obama took the case for war to a reluctant Congress instead, and under the lingering American threat and pressure from Moscow, Mr. al-Assad agreed to the destruction of the weapons.The hesitation appears to have left an impression on Mr. Putin. “It was decisive, I think,” said Mr. Hollande, the former French president, who had readied warplanes to take part in the planned military strike. “Decisive for American credibility, and that had consequences. After that, I believe, Mr. Putin considered Mr. Obama weak.”Certainly, Mr. Putin rapidly ramped up his efforts to expand Russian power.Ukraine, by ousting its Moscow-backed leader in a bloody popular uprising in February 2014, and so de facto rejecting Mr. Putin’s multibillion-dollar blandishments to join his Eurasian Union rather than pursue an association agreement with the European Union, committed the unpardonable. This, for Mr. Putin, was the devouring specter of color revolution made real. It was, he insisted, an American-backed “coup.”ImageA protester’s funeral in Kyiv in 2014.

Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesMr. Putin’s annexation of Crimea and orchestration of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine that created two Russian-backed breakaway regions followed.Two decades earlier, in 1994, Russia had signed an agreement known as the Budapest Memorandum, under which Ukraine gave up its vast nuclear arsenal in exchange for a promise of respect for its sovereignty and existing borders. But Mr. Putin had no interest in that commitment.Mr. Heusgen said a breaking point for Ms. Merkel came when she asked Mr. Putin about the “little green men” — masked Russian soldiers — who appeared in Crimea before the Russian annexation in March 2014. “I have nothing to do with them,” Mr. Putin responded, unconvincingly.“He lied to her — lies, lies, lies,” Mr. Heusgen said. “From then on, she was much more skeptical about Mr. Putin.” She would tell Mr. Obama that the Russian leader was “living in another world.”Later, when Mr. Putin ordered Russian forces into Syria and, in 2016, embarked on the ferocious bombardment of Aleppo, Ms. Merkel told him the bombing had to stop. But the Russian leader would have none of it.ImageMasked Russian soldiers appeared in Crimea before Russia seized it from Ukraine in March 2014.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesImageA building destroyed by air strikes in Aleppo, Syria, in October 2016.Credit...Karam Al-Masri/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“He said there were some Chechen fighters and terrorists there, and he did not want them back, and he would bomb the whole of Aleppo to get rid of them,” Mr. Heusgen said. “It was of an absolute brutality. I mean, how brutal can you get?”Lies and brutality: The core methods of late Putin were clear enough. For anyone who was listening, Mr. Lavrov, the foreign minister, had made that evident at the 2015 Munich Security Conference.In a speech as violent as Mr. Putin’s in 2007, Mr. Lavrov accused Ukrainians of engaging in an orgy of “nationalistic violence” characterized by ethnic purges directed against Jews and Russians. The annexation of Crimea occurred because a popular uprising demanded “the right of self-determination” under the United Nations Charter, he claimed.The United States, in Mr. Lavrov’s account, was driven by an insatiable desire for global dominance. Europe, once the Cold War ended, should have built “the common European house” — a “free economic zone” from Lisbon to Vladivostok — rather than expand NATO eastward.But not many people were listening. The United States and most of Europe — less so the states closest to Russia — glided on in the seldom-questioned belief that the Russian threat, while growing, was contained; that Mr. Putin was a rational man whose use of force involved serious cost-benefit analysis; and that European peace was assured. The oligarchs continued to make “Londongrad” their home; Britain’s Conservative Party was glad to take money from them. Prominent figures in Germany, France and Austria were happy to accept well-paid Russian sinecures. They included Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, and François Fillon, the former French prime minister. Russian oil and gas poured into Europe.Prominent intellectuals, including Hélène Carrère d’Encausse, the perpetual secretary of the Académie Française and a specialist in Russian history, defended Mr. Putin strongly, even in the run-up to the war in Ukraine. “The United States applied itself to humiliating Russia,” she told a French TV interviewer, suggesting the simultaneous dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact would have better served the world.As for former President Donald J. Trump, he never had a critical word for Mr. Putin, preferring to believe him rather than his own intelligence services on the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.ImageThen-President Donald J. Trump with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in 2018.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesImageA security guard stopped journalists from entering Kensington Palace Gardens, a private road in London where many Russians own property.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York Times“With hindsight, we should have started long ago what we now need to do in a rush,” Mr. Bagger, the senior German diplomat, said. “Strengthen our military and diversify energy supplies. Instead we went along and expanded resource flows from Russia. And we dragged along a hollowed-out army.”He added: “We did not realize that Putin had spun himself into a historical mythology and was thinking in categories of a 1,000-year empire. You cannot deter someone like that with sanctions.”The War in UkraineThe unthinkable can happen. Russia’s war of choice in Ukraine is proof of that. Watching it unfold, Ms. Bermann told me she had been reminded of lines from “The Human Stain” by Philip Roth: “The danger with hatred is, once you start in on it, you get a hundred times more than you bargained for. Once you start, you can’t stop.”In the isolation of Covid-19, apparently redoubled by the germaphobia that has led the Russian leader to impose what Mr. Bagger called “extraordinary arrangements” for anyone meeting him, all Mr. Putin’s obsessions about the 25 million Russians lost to their motherland at the breakup of the Soviet Union seem to have coagulated.“Something happened,” said Ms. Bermann, who was greeted by a smiling Mr. Putin when she presented her credentials as ambassador in 2017. “He speaks with a new rage and fury, a kind of folly.”Ms. Rice was similarly struck. “Something is definitely different,” she said. “He’s not in control of his emotions. Something is wrong.”After President Emmanuel Macron of France met with Putin at opposite ends of a 20-foot table last month, he told journalists on his plane that he found him more stiff, isolated and ideologically unyielding than at their previous meeting in 2019. Mr. Macron’s aides described Mr. Putin as physically changed, his face puffy. “Paranoid” was the word chosen by the French president’s top diplomatic adviser to describe a speech by Mr. Putin just before the war.That Ukraine got to Mr. Putin in some deeply disturbing way is evident in the 5,000-word tract on “The Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians” that he penned in his isolation last summer and had distributed to members of the armed forces. Marshaling arguments ranging back to the ninth century, he said that “Russia was robbed, indeed.” Ukraine was now home to “radicals and neo-Nazis” intent on effacing any trace of Russia.“We will never allow our historical territories and people close to us living there to be used against Russia,” he wrote. “And to those who will undertake such an attempt, I would like to say that this way they will destroy their own country.”ImageSelf-propelled Russian howitzers being loaded onto a train car outside Taganrog, Russia, two days before the invasion of Ukraine.Credit...The New York TimesImageIn a Taganrog hotel room last month, a family who had fled separatist-held territory in Ukraine watched Mr. Putin on television. Russia had spread false claims that Ukraine’s government was about to attack the separatist regions.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesHis intent, in hindsight, was clear enough, many months before the invasion. It appeared so to Mr. Eltchaninoff, the French author. “The religion of war had installed itself,” he said. “Putin had replaced the real with a myth.”But why now? The West, Mr. Putin had long since concluded, was weak, divided, decadent, given over to private consumption and promiscuity. Germany had a new leader, and France an imminent election. A partnership with China had been cemented. Poor intelligence persuaded him Russian troops would be greeted as liberators in wide swaths of eastern Ukraine, at least. Covid-19, Mr. Bagger said, “had given him a sense of urgency, that time was running out.”Mr. Hollande, the former president, had a simpler explanation: “Putin was drunk on his success. In recent years, he has won enormously.” In Crimea, in Syria, in Belarus, in Africa, in Kazakhstan. “Putin tells himself, ‘I am advancing everywhere. Where am I in retreat? Nowhere!’”That is no longer the case. In a single stroke, Mr. Putin has galvanized NATO, ended Swiss neutrality and German postwar pacifism, united an often fragmented European Union, hobbled the Russian economy for years to come, provoked a massive exodus of educated Russians and reinforced the very thing he denied had ever existed, in a way that will prove indelible: Ukrainian nationhood. He has been outmaneuvered by the agile and courageous Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a man he mocked.“He has undone on a coin-flip the achievements of his presidency,” said Mr. Gabuev, the Carnegie Moscow senior fellow now in Istanbul. For Mr. Hollande, “Mr. Putin has committed the irremediable.”President Biden has called Mr. Putin a “brute,” a “war criminal” and a “killer.” “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” he said in Poland on Saturday. Yet the Russian leader retains deep reserves of support in Russia, and tight control over his security services.That power corrupts is well known. An immense distance seems to separate the man who won over the Bundestag in 2001 with a conciliatory speech and the ranting leader berating the “national traitors” seduced by the West who “can’t do without foie gras, oysters or the so-called gender freedoms,” as he put it in his scum-and-traitors speech this month. If nuclear war remains a remote possibility, it is far less remote than a month ago — a subject of regular dinner-table conversations across Europe as Mr. Putin pursues the “de-Nazification” of a country whose leader is Jewish.It is as if, after a flirtation with a new idea — a Russia integrated with the West — Mr. Putin, who will be 70 this year, reverted to something deeper in his psyche: the world of his childhood after The Great Patriotic War had been won, with Russia in his head again liberating Ukrainians from Nazism, and Stalin restored to heroic stature.With his assault on independent media completed, his insistence that the invasion is not a “war,” and his liquidation of Memorial International, the leading human rights organization chronicling Stalin-era persecution, Mr. Putin has circled back to his roots in a totalitarian country.Mr. Röttgen, who stood to applaud Mr. Putin 21 years ago, told me: “I think at this point he either wins or he’s done. Done politically, or done physically.”Audio produced by Parin Behrooz.ImageUkrainian soldiers used a photo of Mr. Putin for target practice in January.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russia.html
55,"Good evening. This is your Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, a weeknight guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict.At least 50 people were killed and nearly 100 wounded in a missile attack on a train station in eastern Ukraine.Russia called the reports that it was responsible for the attack a “provocation” and blamed Ukraine.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, visited the town of Bucha,where hundreds of civilians were killed, and Kyiv. The Cayman Islands have frozen $7.3 billion in accounts believed to be tied to Russian oligarchs.These maps show the Russian redeployment in eastern Ukraine.Follow our live updates.ImageBodies were covered with tarps after the rocket attack on a train station platform in Kramatorsk.Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDozens killed in train station attackThe hundreds of people — mostly women, children and older people — who were packed on the train station platform in Kramatorsk this morning were heeding the warnings of Ukrainian officials to leave the eastern region before a new wave of Russian attacks.Then a missile strike tore through the station, killing at least 50 people and wounding nearly 100. Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the atrocity. Moscow denied any responsibility.Photos provided by Ukrainian officials showed victims splayed on the ground, surrounded by scattered luggage and debris. In a video, a woman screams, “There are so many corpses, there are children, there are just children!”Kramatorsk has been a main departure point for thousands trying to escape to safety this week as Russia shifts the focus of its war to the eastern Donbas region. Moscow aims to create a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that the Russians knew that the train station in Kramatorsk was full of civilians waiting to be evacuated. “This was a deliberate slaughter. We will bring each war criminal to justice,” he said.After the strike, the Ukrainian police inspected the remains of a large rocket with the words “for our children” in Russian next to the train station. It was unclear who had written the message and where the rocket came from.Ukrainian officials said they were scrambling to find cars and buses to evacuate civilians to western areas. Ukrainian Railways said that trains would continue to leave from nearby Sloviansk, a city to the north, where shelters and hospitals have been stocked with food and medicine in anticipation of an imminent Russian offensive, according to the mayor.As the war enters its seventh week, the strike laid bare its mounting civilian toll. Russian forces have targeted civilians and infrastructure, devastating cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol in what appears to be a bid to break the spirit of Ukrainians.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.ImageLeaving a subway station in Kyiv last week.

After the retreat of Russian forces from the surrounding suburbs, some sense of calm has returned to the Ukrainian capital.Our correspondents Maria Varenikova and Andrew Kramer report that residents are returning to the city, which was emptied of nearly half of its population of around three million over the past weeks, according to city officials.One of those residents is Kolya Rybytva, 24, who left Kyiv the day after Russia invaded and headed west with his grandmother and younger sister. Two weeks ago, he returned just as Ukrainian forces were starting to push Russian troops out of the suburbs.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“The feelings are strange,” he said. “You seem to be returning to your usual life, realizing that it will never be normal again.” Just to be able to return, he said, was “real happiness.”“When you see the first familiar streets, you can’t even believe you’re here,” he said. “It is strange, joyful and painful.” His apartment was undamaged, he said.Despite the disruption to his life, returning to Kyiv provided a kind of “triumphant feeling,” he said. “But you understand that it is deceptive — victory is far away, security is fragile, and in many parts of the country, everything is getting worse. You are not happy, and you cannot be happy, remembering what happened in the suburbs,” he said, referring to atrocities like those in Bucha.What else we’re followingIn UkraineCivilians near Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, are discovering a new threat: timed land mines that explode at intervals.Ukraine is asking the West for more modern, NATO-made weapons rather than Soviet-made equipment, the country’s defense minister said.The Russian assault has been a nightmare for expectant mothers. Many have been forced to give birth in basements or subway stations, without midwives to assist them, or even electricity or running water.The World Health Organization said it had verified 103 attacks on Ukrainian health care sites and ambulances since Russian forces invaded.Stanislav Aseyev spent two and a half years in a notorious prison run by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

56,"In a rare convergence, America’s voters are not merely unhappy with their political leadership, but awash in fears about economic security, border security, international security and even physical security. Without a U-turn by the Biden administration, this fear will generate a wave election like those in 1994 and 2010, setting off a chain reaction that could flip the House and the Senate to Republican control in November, and ultimately the presidency in 2024.Take the economy, so often the harbinger of election results. From late 2017 until the pandemic, a majority of Americans believed that the economy was strong, and from 2014 until the pandemic at least a plurality believed their personal economic situation was improving. Covid-19 cut sharply into that feeling of well-being; this was initially seen as temporary, though, and trillions of dollars flowed into keeping people afloat. But then near-double-digit inflation hit consumers for the first time in 40 years; 60 percent of voters now see the economy as weak and 48 percent say their financial situation is worsening, according to a Harris poll conducted April 20-21. Many Americans under 60 have relatively little experience with anything but comparatively low fuel costs, negligible interest rates and stable prices. Virtually overnight these assumptions have been shaken. Only 35 percent approve of President Biden’s handling of inflation.These economic blows are just one element in a cascading set of problems all hitting at the same time. It combines the nuclear anxieties of the 1950s and ’60s with the inflation threat of the ’70s, the crime wave of the ’80s and ’90s and the tensions over illegal immigration in the 2000s and beyond. This electorate is not experiencing a malaise, as President Jimmy Carter was once apocryphally said to have proclaimed, but has instead formed into a deep national fissure ready to blow like a geyser in the next election if leadership does not move to relieve the pressure.The return of fear about crime is especially worrisome for Democrats, who spent years trying to take over Republican ground on the issue. In 1991, the homicide rate was 9.71 per hundred thousand. Mr. Biden, when he was a senator, penned the key federal bipartisan anti-crime bill widely credited then with reducing violence in America, but under criticism today by those who argue it led to inequitable rates of incarceration, particularly in communities of color. The homicide rate would decline to a low of 4.44 per 100,000 in 2014. Worries about walking the streets and riding the subway were less acute among new generations, and yet today those same streets and mass transit are once again hobbled by fear; even the head of the New York-area Metropolitan Transportation Authority argued that fear of crime and homelessness were behind a 36 percent drop in ridership between December 2021 and January 2022.Immigration was used effectively by President Donald Trump as a wedge issue to win working class voters. According to the April Harris poll, under Mr. Biden, 59 percent of voters believe that we have “effectively” open borders and, looking back, many even support some of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. Mr. Biden receives only 38 percent approval for his immigration policy, a troublingly low rating for a Democrat (President Barack Obama was at 29 percent approval on immigration policy before the 2010 midterm wipeout).ImageMigrants seeking asylum in the U.S., standing near the border fence while waiting to be processed after crossing the border from Mexico at Yuma, Arizona.Credit...Go Nakamura/ReutersNational security had become less salient for most Americans compared to the years of the Cold War and after 9/11. Foreign policy was barely discussed in the limited presidential debates of 2020. Today, fear of a great power conflict and nuclear weapons has emerged in ways not seen since the Cold War. With the invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin, fresh ballistic missile tests, and Mr. Putin’s explicit reference to the use of nuclear weapons and “unpredictable” consequences of opposing him, fear of nuclear weapons has been thrust front and center, as a recent focus group of Americans by Times Opinion found as well. Fear of nuclear weapons now ranks second in issues that worry voters, behind the effects of inflation.To combat the drag that fear has on the electorate — what I call a “fear index” — Mr. Biden will have to move in some big and bold ways. Faced with runaway spending in the 1990s, President Bill Clinton proposed a balanced budget, a policy still favored by 80 percent of the electorate, according to April’s Harris poll, but he did it in a way that still managed to finance entitlements like Social Security. Pushing a big, seven-year policy plan like that would mean finding budget cuts elsewhere to pay for a permanent child tax credit, rather than raising taxes, and deficit spending, which would most likely cause costs to fall on the average American through inflation. Balancing the budget would change the conversation about the economy and show Americans that Mr. Biden was serious about getting our fiscal house in order.Continuing to let gas prices surge will hurt Democrats on the ballot in the fall; the party needs a new, tempered energy policy that includes a more gradual transition to alternative fuels and an appreciation of energy independence. In the presidential debates, Mr. Biden promised a “transition” to “renewable energy over time,” though noting he would not attempt to ban fracking. But in his first flurry of executive orders, Biden gave the public the impression he was far more aggressive in favoring climate change policies, though he has since angered activists by reversing a promise to prevent new drilling on public lands. He will need to shift to an “all of the above” energy approach and green-light the Keystone pipeline, which 65 percent of the electorate says should move forward, according to the Harris poll.The Biden administration is also losing in swing areas on immigration, as evidenced by the nine Senate Democrats and the House’s bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that have expressed reservations about its plan to lift Title 42, the Trump administration’s Covid-era policy of intercepting and returning migrants without due process. The answer is to keep in place the Covid-related border restrictions and revive trying to find a real compromise with at least 10 Republican senators on immigration that would adopt tougher barrier and enforcement measures to close the border, but also open up legal immigration and a path to citizenship for at least DACA recipients.With rising crime as an issue, the favorable rating of the Department of Justice has sunk to just 51 percent under Merrick Garland, according to the Harris poll. Mr. Biden needs to shake up his top law-enforcement officials and back legislation that combines police reform with funding for hundreds of thousands of new community police officers, greater federal involvement in stopping violent crime syndicates and gangs, and wider discretion for judges to take violent criminals off the streets. The administration needs to consider interceding on behalf of victims in circumstances in which district attorneys are not prosecuting violent criminals to the full extent of the law, especially when they waive “enhancements” for gang-related crimes. One of our first campaign ads in 1996 established President Clinton as both against assault-weapons and for more cops and crime-fighting measures; he kept that message up during his re-election bid, and Republicans never effectively stoked fears about crime.Finally, Mr. Biden cannot let Mr. Putin win in Ukraine, and needs to continue to send whatever weapons are necessary, including jets, to prevent such a victory. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan precipitated a decline in his administration’s approval rates. Ukraine’s loss would compound the view among some voters that he is too weak.According to reports, Mr. Biden now says he is running for re-election in 2024. But he is facing limited enthusiasm in his own party for a second run and loses even to Mr. Trump in hypothetical matchups, according to the Harris poll. Sticking to the high-priced Build Back Better legislation or variants of it on the basis of narrow party-line votes has not been successful.People are afraid of being walloped financially, being injured or menaced by criminals, being in a country without strong borders or Covid protections for immigrants, and being under threat of nuclear weapons. If Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders cannot effectively address these fears, the wave election will hit them in November, and the president will then face a sobering choice of either passing the baton to another candidate in 2024 or finding the bold leadership necessary to reconcile his drive for more progressive policies with the realities of economics, politics and a more dangerous world.Mark Penn was a pollster and adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton from 1995 to 2008.

57,"BRUSSELS — As envoys made progress in peace talks on Tuesday, Russia offered concessions that signaled a more realistic course for the war in Ukraine, while indicating it is also in no hurry to end the conflict, according to diplomats and analysts.Russia’s deputy defense minister, Aleksandr Fomin, presented the decision to “sharply reduce” military activity around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv as a gesture “to increase mutual trust for future negotiations.”But the Russian advance in the north had already stalled, with troops around Kyiv taking up defensive positions in the face of Ukrainian counterattacks, both there and near Sumy, where Russia has been having trouble encircling the main Ukrainian army east of the Dnieper River.“De-escalation is a euphemism for retreat,” said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of War Studies at King’s College London. “Russia is adjusting its goals to reality, because war is quite empirical,” he said. “It’s not a ruse to say that they are concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”But retreat is hardly surrender, and others cautioned that the progress made Tuesday doesn’t mean that Russia is ready for serious discussions on ending the war. That would require a better outcome for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to sell at home as a victory.On Tuesday, the Ukrainians outlined a 15-year process of negotiations about the status of Crimea, and said that control of the Donbas Region could be discussed in meetings between Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Russia has said it would only set a meeting between the two presidents once a draft peace agreement was ready.Some analysts say such an agreement would, at minimum, have to give Russia control of Mariupol, the besieged port city in Ukraine that is still somehow holding out, to create a secure land route between two areas that Russia occupies: Crimea to the west, and the Donbas to the east.

If he takes the area east of the Dnieper, “that may be enough for now, but he will rebuild his army and continue.”For both sides, said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London research institution, “the negotiations are not serious, in the sense that negotiations now for both sides are a continuation of the war, not a solution.” Russia can concentrate on the east, and Ukraine will find it hard to move from its agile defense to serious counterattacks, he said. “And Putin hasn’t forgotten about Kyiv.”Even if Mr. Putin can control and “settle” for another partition of Ukraine in the east, “Ukraine has to sign up for it, and if not, I don’t think we lift the sanctions,” Mr. Niblett said.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.His colleague, Mathieu Boulègue, a French scholar who studies the Russian military, agrees that Russia is not negotiating in good faith, but “testing the waters and applying for time, to regroup and re-equip militarily and make more gains on the ground.”The Russian military appears to have taken control of what might be called Phase 2 of a botched operation, he said, which should have been Phase 1. Taking Mariupol, the land bridge and the Donbas “would have been the grown-up military plan.” Modern warfare is half information warfare, Mr. Boulègue said, “and success is what you make of it,” especially in a repressive media environment as in Russia now.The Russian forces’ inability to capture cities and keep territory is apparent after a month, he said, “so strategic goals have had to change.”ImageDemonstrators protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday.Credit...Francisco Seco/Associated PressBut to completely withdraw from Kyiv would allow the Ukrainians to reinforce the Donbas region and give them a significant victory, suggested Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at CNA, a defense research institution in Virginia, in a tweet.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Traveling in Morocco, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken also cast doubt on Russia’s pledge to reduce hostilities. “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” he said on Tuesday. “We’re focused on the latter. And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that continues as we speak.”Russia did not stop fighting after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but actively supported the separatists in the Donbas, said Ian Bond, a former British diplomat in Russia and the head of foreign policy for the Center for European Reform. “I’m a skeptic about the Russians giving up on the war,” he said. “We’ve seen this movie before in 2014 and 2015. I view this as only a pause.”Ian Garner, a historian of Russian propaganda, pointed out on Twitter that “Putin’s Russia — indeed, post-Soviet Russia — has been engaged in mucky, endless conflicts for years,” citing Transnistria in Moldova, Abkhazia in Georgia and the Donbas, all areas in other countries where Russian forces back separatist movements. “Not ended, maybe,” he said, but “in the intermission.”The senior Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, suggested after the talks on Tuesday that the two sides were talking seriously about neutrality for Ukraine, a treaty guaranteeing its security by NATO member states like the United States, Britain, Turkey, France and Germany, a cease-fire and humanitarian corridors.Ukrainian and Western officials also suggested that Russia would be willing for a demilitarized Ukraine to join the European Union, so long as it forswore joining NATO or hosting any foreign forces.But security analysts questioned the sincerity of such an agreement.Mr. Bond said that the problem with Ukraine’s notion of neutrality is that so far none of the countries it wants to guarantee it would agree to do so. It would be like NATO membership with collective defense by another name, so highly unlikely, he said.As for European Union membership, Mr. Niblett said, that would represent the largest danger to Mr. Putin, who helped stimulate the 2014 revolt in Ukraine when he forced the then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, to renege on a trade agreement with the bloc. If Ukraine joined now, Mr. Niblett said, the country would develop economically even faster, in contrast to Russia, “and you would end up with a South Korea next to a North Korea, and I can’t see Putin accepting that.”ImageA Ukrainian soldier in Kyiv, Ukraine, reviewing drone footage of Irpin, taken more than a week ago, on Monday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesEven more, he said, the European Union treaties contain a collective defense promise as well.Still, Mr. Boulègue said, the European Union needs to give Ukraine a clear response about its prospects for membership. “Whether that leads to E.U. membership or not is not for Russia to decide,” he said. “But the E.U. needs to be absolutely clear about the future of Ukraine going forward, it’s the moral thing to do.”Lara Jakes contributed reporting from Rabat, Morocco.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html
58,"Recently I reached out to Serhiy Leshchenko, one of Ukraine’s most prominent investigative journalists, whom I’d met in Kyiv shortly before Donald Trump’s first impeachment. At the time, Leshchenko was being regularly smeared by people in Trump’s orbit who placed the journalist at the center of an elaborate conspiracy theory designed to make it look as if Trump was fighting corruption in Ukraine, not encouraging it.Now Leshchenko is advising the chief of staff for Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, on Russian disinformation. He’s been especially worried about Russian lies about Ukrainian chemical and biological weapons, fearing that their purpose is to sow confusion ahead of a possible Russian chemical weapons attack. “Every day they have dozens of different stakeholders” promoting falsehoods about unconventional weapons made in Ukraine, he said. “It has to have an explanation. Why do they repeatedly say the same stuff?”Leshchenko’s fear is shared by some American officials. “Based on a number of factors, some of which I can’t discuss, I sadly would be surprised if they don’t use chemical weapons,” Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told me last week.Given the stakes, it’s alarming to Leshchenko to hear influential Americans repeating Russian talking points. “You maybe know this Georgia congresswoman, Marjorie Greene?” he asked, and then mentioned a recent floor speech in which Greene speculated that bioweapons labs in Ukraine could end up killing people.Last week, further juicing the conspiracy theory, the Russian government linked the alleged biolabs to Hunter Biden and George Soros. On Thursday, Tucker Carlson picked up the Hunter Biden story line. (America has funded programs in Ukraine to secure labs studying pathogens and toxins, sometimes for vaccine development, and to watch for disease outbreaks.)There is, said Leshchenko, a pattern to Russian disinformation campaigns. This one started, he said, with anonymous social media accounts. Then it was propagated by Russian propaganda outfits like Russia Today, followed by Russian officials like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and Vladimir Putin himself. Finally it went global. In information warfare, Leshchenko said, it helps to have “international recognition” of fictitious claims. Elements of the American right were happy to supply it.Russia’s war on Ukraine has for the moment led many Republicans to rediscover their inner Cold Warriors. But pro-Putin sentiment — or, at least, anti-anti-Putin sentiment — remains strong on parts of the right. As NBC’s Ben Collins and Kevin Collier reported, “The biolab conspiracy theory has taken over as the prevailing narrative on pro-Trump and QAnon websites like The Great Awakening and Patriots.”With Trump out of power, it can be tempting to dismiss the import of such fantasies, but the Republican Party doesn’t have a great record of standing up to its fringe — witness the recent QAnon-inflected attempt to link the Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson to pedophilia. Having watched Trump try to extort Zelensky, Ukrainians know it can be geopolitically consequential when crackpot Russian conspiracy theories gain a foothold in American politics.Putin, presumably, knows this as well, which helps explain why he’s appealing to Anglophone culture warriors. On Friday, Putin gave a speech in which he complained about cancel culture and compared Russia’s international isolation to denunciations of the “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling for her views on gender. It was preposterous, but it was also a signal to the Western right that his struggle is theirs. It’s what Putin has been doing for years, particularly in the wake of the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when, as Casey Michel wrote in Politico, “Moscow began forging a new role for itself at the helm of the global Christian right.”Defending itself from Russia, Ukraine has been waging a globalized culture war of its own, trying to rally the world to an idealized liberal internationalism. Zelensky has framed Ukraine’s fight for survival as a fight not just for national self-determination, but for progressive modernity. As he said in his address to Congress, “Today, the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future.” He speaks to the highest aspirations of Western audiences who’ve been starved for inspiration.Some of the most resonant videos coming out of Ukraine are about their determination to keep music in their lives even in wartime — like the man playing cello on a ruined street in Kharkiv, and the people in Odessa building fortifications while a band performs Bon Jovi’s “It’s My Life.” These videos go viral because they link the staggering courage of the Ukrainians to a common Western culture: Ukrainians seem like us as we wish we were.The ability of Ukraine to elicit international solidarity has been among its most potent weapons in this war. Against it, Putin needs some solidarity of his own, and the natural place for him to look for it is among liberalism’s enemies. He is working to cultivate cynicism about Ukrainian heroism, and convince those alienated by Western culture to identify with Russia. If he’s going to visit further atrocities on the Ukrainians, it helps to have Americans claiming it’s their own fault.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

59,"Western officials expressed outrage on Sunday at videos and images emerging from Bucha, a town near Kyiv, that appeared to show civilian bodies scattered on the streets after Russia withdrew its troops from the area in recent days.Footage posted by Ukraine’s Defense Ministry and photographs from news agencies showed the bodies of men in civilian clothes lying on the streets of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv. Some images showed bodies with their hands bound behind their backs.Russia’s Ministry of Defense called the images “staged,” saying in a statement Sunday that “not a single” civilian had been injured in Bucha.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in an interview on CNN that the images were in line with the Biden administration’s warnings that Russian forces would commit abuses.“You can’t help but see these images as a punch to the gut, and look, we’ve said before Russia’s aggression that we thought it was likely that they would commit atrocities,” Mr. Blinken said, adding: “We can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalize this. This is the reality of what’s going on every single day.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the accounts of civilian deaths in Bucha showed “that Russian hatred towards Ukrainians is beyond anything Europe has seen since WWII.” He reiterated a call for increased sanctions against Russia and for more military assistance for his country.“The only way to stop this: help Ukraine kick Russians out as soon as possible,” he tweeted.He also called for an investigation by the International Criminal Court to gather evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. U.S. and British officials said that their governments would help collect evidence to assist investigators.President Emmanuel Macron of France called the images “unbearable.”“In the streets, hundreds of civilians were murdered in a cowardly way,” Mr. Macron said in a message posted on Twitter on Sunday, adding, “The Russian authorities will have to answer for these crimes.”The outrage could move the needle in terms of European sanctions against Russia. The European Union has so far rebuffed calls from both Ukraine and President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on Russian oil and gas, citing the bloc’s dependency on Russian fuels. But on Sunday, Germany’s defense minister voiced a significant shift in her country’s position. The defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, said on a German TV program that the bloc should consider banning Russian gas imports in light of the Bucha atrocities.Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, expressed his shock over the images and said in a tweet that more European Union sanctions against Russia “are on their way.”Several other European officials expressed their alarm at the images from Bucha.Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, said on Twitter that the images were “cold reality of Putin’s war crimes,” adding that the world “must be aware of what is happening.”Analysts say that while war crimes cases can be brought before the International Criminal Court at the Hague, it would be extremely difficult to hold Russian leaders to account there because the court lacks enforcement powers. Prosecution at the International Court of Justice is also possible, but any ruling would need to be enforced by the United Nations Security Council, where Russia holds veto power.American lawmakers said the reports from Bucha justified further assistance to Ukraine, with some calling for the provision of more surface-to-air missiles to help Ukrainian forces. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said that “we need to do more to help Ukraine, and we need to do more quickly.”Constant Méheut and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels, Emily Cochrane from Washington, Ivan Nechepurenko from Istanbul and Cassandra Vinograd from London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/world/dead-civilians-bucha-ukraine.html
60,"WASHINGTON — Using a mix of high-tech and Cold War tactics, Ukrainian activists and Western institutions have begun to pierce the propaganda bubble in Russia, circulating information about the Ukraine war among Russian citizens to sow doubt about the Kremlin’s accounts.The efforts come at a particularly urgent moment: Moscow appears to be preparing for a new assault in eastern Ukraine that could prove devastatingly bloody to both sides, while mounting reports of atrocities make plain the brutality of the Kremlin’s tactics.As Russia presents a sanitized version of the war, Ukrainian activists have been sending messages highlighting government corruption and incompetence in an effort to undermine faith in the Kremlin.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S.-funded but independent news organization founded decades ago, is trying to push its broadcasts deeper into Russia. Its Russian-language articles are published on copies of its websites called “mirrors,” which Russian censors seek out in a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole. Audience numbers have surged during the war despite the censorship.American organizations are also promoting the use of software that allows Russian citizens to leap over the nascent firewall erected by the Kremlin to control internet access.The efforts face high barriers as the Kremlin tightens controls on journalists and the internet, passing laws that have forced the closure of independent media outlets, like the Echo of Moscow. President Vladimir V. Putin is doing all he can to keep Russians in the dark about Europe’s largest land war since 1945, with casualties going largely unreported in Russian news media.The Russian government has focused in particular on restricting reports of war casualties. In its most recent official announcement, in late March, Russia reported 1,351 military deaths, while the latest American intelligence estimate, which was shared with Congress in recent days, put the number at 4,000 to 5,000.ImageThe Echo of Moscow studio in March, just before the media outlet was shut down.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesBut cracks in Moscow’s facade are starting to show. On Thursday, the Kremlin’s spokesman acknowledged that Russia had suffered “significant losses.”After the war started in February, Mr. Putin began erecting an internet firewall similar to China’s to block some Russian and Western news sites and social media networks. Russians can still visit Google and YouTube, but many Western sources of news are labeled “foreign agents.”An authoritarian government does not have to maintain a perfect firewall to keep its public in a propaganda bubble. Many Russians get their news from state-controlled television and radio. And some Russian analysts argue that most citizens support the government for reasons beyond their news diet and want to believe the Kremlin’s lines.American intelligence officials say that is why pushing information into Russia, and reaching the broadest population, is so difficult.Nevertheless, American and European officials say that the attempt by outsiders to get facts about the war to Russians is important.For now, Mr. Putin and the invasion remain popular in Russia, according to polls, though analysts caution that such measures of Russian attitudes are unreliable, mainly because many people fear making antiwar statements. The police have arrested thousands of protesters, and many people self-censor their remarks on Ukraine.There are early signs that the efforts to break down the wall of propaganda may be working, said a senior Western intelligence official, who like other security officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified or sensitive government assessments.And an American data analytics company, FilterLabs.AI, which has been tracking Russian sentiment on internet message boards and other online forums, says it has measured growing anxiety among Russians about the draft and war casualties. Mr. Putin recently signed a decree ordering up about 134,500 conscripts, though the Defense Ministry said they would not go to Ukraine.“We could be at a turning point in Russian sentiment toward the initial invasion of Ukraine, when Russia attempted to take over the whole country,” said Jonathan D. Teubner, the chief executive of FilterLabs.Planting the Seeds of DoubtImagePeople using mobile phones in Moscow’s Federation Tower. Ukrainian activists are tailoring messages to appeal to different portions of the Russian population.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThe email to the 18-year-old Russian was, in some ways, subtle. It did not directly mention the invasion of Ukraine or allegations of war crimes against Russian soldiers.Instead, it talked about the mistreatment of Russian soldiers by their own military and suggested the Russian government was lying to conscripts and, crucially, providing inadequate food and equipment to the country’s soldiers.Over the last two weeks, a group of Ukrainian activists, government officials and think tanks, called the Information Strategies Council of Ukraine, has sent emails and social media messages to 15 million Russian men of draft age, between 18 and 27. It aimed other posts at older Russians, using historical references to prod them to discuss government-sanctioned news reports.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 9:01 a.m. ETFires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.Shelling echoes around Kharkiv after an Easter lull.Tens of thousands are without power as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine.“The fundamental problem is that when you want to tackle the propaganda, you cannot just say what you are getting on TV is not true; it doesn’t work like that,” said Sophia Hnizdovska, an executive at the council. “We are trying to slowly, through our narratives, make people question the official sources.”The most successful posts by the Ukrainian activists have built on this theme, focusing on the incompetence and corruption of Russian military leaders, members of the group say.One image circulated by the group portrayed senior Russian military leaders, including Sergei K. Shoigu, the defense minister, with his head filled with question marks and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the senior military leader, with his head filled with an image of a superyacht.Russians tend to dismiss messages highlighting Russian war crimes as American propaganda, according to activists, and pictures of Russian casualties run the risk of inciting anger at Ukraine, rather than the Kremlin.Mr. Teubner’s company is trying to measure the Ukrainians’ success — and in recent days has tracked what appears to be growing negative sentiment across Russia toward a draft. If the Ukrainians can sow enough doubt about the truthfulness of the Russian government, Ms. Hnizdovska said, more Russians will seek out information from Western-supported Russian-language news media.Radio Waves and Real NewsImageJournalists working in Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Moscow studio last year. The broadcaster has since moved to new sites in Lithuania and Latvia.Credit...Evgenia Novozhenina/ReutersDuring the Cold War, the U.S. government, and the C.I.A. specifically, helped found and fund independent media organizations with the mission to penetrate the Iron Curtain with fact-based news.With the invasion of Ukraine, the organizations are once again operating with a sense of urgency as they push to get accurate information inside an authoritarian state.The news organizations are using both old-school and 21st-century tactics, creating radio programs and complex digital information campaigns.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the main private, independent news organization in the region with U.S. government financing, is producing journalism on the war from reporters on the front lines in Ukraine and working quietly in Russia.Commonly known as RFE/RL, the group has a Russian-language news site and a 24-hour Russian-language television network, Current Time, as well as websites aimed at regional audiences in a wide range of languages, including Tatar, Chechen and Belarusian.Like some other news organizations and U.S.-based social media companies, its websites were blocked in Russia starting in late February. And it suspended its main operations in Russia last month.RFE/RL opened offices in Lithuania and Latvia as new bases for its reporting on Russia. The group also has a medium-wave radio transmitter in Lithuania to send broadcasts into Russia that can be picked up on an AM frequency. Officials said they hoped to expand the signal’s strength.The group uses Telegram, a chat app, to disseminate some of its reporting and to send out the web addresses of its new “mirror” sites.A Washington-based sister organization that also gets funding from the U.S. government, the Open Technology Fund, sets up the mirror sites and constantly creates new ones to stay a step ahead of Russian government censors.“In the context of new censorship, the mirror program has grown rapidly and Russian censors are proving to be a very active adversary,” said Nat Kretchun, the organization’s senior vice president for programs. “Our partners are setting up a more automated system where once the Russian censors block them, new sites are set up.”ImageDestroyed buildings and cars in Borodianka, Ukraine. The Russian government has focused on clamping down on reports of casualties in the Ukraine war.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesThe technology group arranges for some of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s sites to be hosted by Tor, a digital communications network that helps shield ordinary internet users from surveillance. And it gives financing to companies and groups developing virtual private network apps, software known as VPNs, that help citizens get around internet firewalls. Owners of smart TVs in Russia can also download an app for Current Time.And Current Time is among the RFE/RL networks and programs with channels on YouTube, which, unlike Facebook and Instagram, has not been blocked by Russian censors. RFE/RL said the number of video views on its YouTube channels more than tripled in the first three weeks of the war, to 237.6 million, from the three weeks prior.“We’re seeing higher audience numbers for Russians inside the country and also for Russians outside,” said Jamie Fly, the president and chief executive of RFE/RL. “The challenge is: Can we maintain that over time? Will interest fade?”In mid-March, Russian news outlets began running stories saying that Russian casualties in Ukraine were low, in contrast to much higher Western estimates. Those reports, according to an analysis by FilterLabs, came just as concern about the country’s war dead was starting to rise on local internet message boards — and as soldiers’ coffins began returning home.Stories about Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine and Russian prisoners of war are among the most popular across RFE/RL platforms, said Patrick Boehler, the head of digital strategy for the news organization. The news agency’s reporters in Ukraine who learn the identities of Russians killed or taken prisoner pass that information to colleagues in Russia, who then try to find and interview the families.The software developed by FilterLabs began tracking changes in public sentiment and shifts in how Russian news outlets talk about wartime casualties. Some skeptics question this kind of artificial-intelligence-driven sentiment analysis, and FilterLabs acknowledges that the technology has limits.But the group says the broad trends it identifies are reliable and show that concern about the draft is increasing, as discussions on message boards appear to indicate that Russians are growing more worried that their children will be conscripted into the military to fight in Ukraine, Mr. Teubner said.“The overall sentiment when talking about the draft is trending very negatively in the popular forums,” he said. “This shows us what is likely one of the greatest vulnerabilities for those trying to maintain support for the war over the long term.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/us/politics/russia-propaganda-ukraine-war.html
61,"ZABKI, Poland — If there is one thing you should understand about the Ukrainian refugee crisis in Poland, it is this: Approximately 90 percent of the displaced are women and children.Because of military conscription, Ukraine does not allow most men between the ages of 18 and 60 to leave the country. So the more than two million people who have crossed the border to escape the Russian invasion are women, children and a few elderly men. That has meant devastating separations for the families involved. But it also means that this regional crisis of forced migration is first and foremost a crisis for women — and, particularly, for mothers. And as hundreds of thousands of displaced families search for ways to support themselves, Poland is confronting longstanding limitations in its support for working mothers, which are now becoming a matter of geopolitical urgency.A world of womenTo understand how the crisis is playing out, I went to Zabki, a small suburb outside Warsaw, which exemplifies both the promise and challenges of the response to the refugees’ arrival.Low property prices and convenient access to Warsaw have made Zabki a popular destination for young families, giving the town one of the highest birthrates in Poland. In recent weeks, however, the town’s growth has accelerated beyond what anyone was anticipating. The first refugees arrived within days of the Russian invasion, said Malgorzata Zysk, the local mayor. Officially, more than 1,500 Ukrainian refugees are now living in the town, with about 100 more registering each day. But Zysk estimated that the real numbers were about twice as high.ImageLyubomira Pancuk, middle, with her daughter Andriana, 15, and her month-old son, Danilo, in Zabki, Poland. The family fled to Poland from Eastern Ukraine.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesIn a small apartment lent to her by Zabki’s city government, one of those refugees, Lyubomira Pancuk, showed me photographs of her family gathered for Orthodox Christmas in January, in their home in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. Bloomingly pregnant, she was next to her husband and three daughters, all smiling for the camera. “We were all together, happy, waiting for the baby,” she said.Less than two months later, the war forced her to flee to Poland with her children, now including a 3-week-old infant, born prematurely and suffering from jaundice. Her husband is still in Ukraine.Her eyes flooded with tears when she described the generosity of Zabki’s government and residents upon their arrival. But the family lives precariously, reliant on a small allowance from the Polish government and the generosity of their Polish neighbors. It is impossible for her to work right now because she must care for her baby.It is a story that I heard over and over from Ukrainian women in Poland. They told me that their priorities were simple: a safe place to live with their children, far from bombs and battles.But security and stability often cost more than the small allowance the Polish government offers to Ukrainian families. Thousands of Polish citizens across the country have lent rooms or apartments to refugees, but many are already asking when their guests will leave. Soon they will need to pay rent. And to afford it, as rents around the country skyrocket in response to the sudden demand, they will need to work.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.That means Ukrainian mothers must solve a higher-stakes version of the problem working mothers face all over the world: how to find affordable and reliable child care, and employers willing to accommodate their needs as parents.A challenging environmentFamily-friendly policies, such as flexible working hours, are relatively rare in Polish workplaces — the legacy of years of high unemployment, said Ida Magda, a labor economist at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics who studies Polish women’s participation in the labor market.Care for children under 3 is often so expensive that many women find it cheaper to stay home until their children are old enough for preschool. And although the government has recently expanded state-funded preschools for 3- to 6-year-olds, known in Poland as kindergartens, spaces were in short supply in many parts of the country even before the war began.Now, the Polish government is scrambling to figure out how that system can accommodate the needs of Ukrainian mothers who have lost everything in the war, and cannot rely on male partners for support.Older children can attend Polish schools. And a recent directive from the ministry of education instructed preschools to add three extra spots per class to accommodate Ukrainian children.But mothers with toddlers or babies have fewer options. In Zabki, for instance, there are no state-run day-care centers for children under 3. Some private centers are offering temporary discounts or free places to Ukrainian children, but such assistance is scarce, and will not necessarily be a reliable long-term solution even for those who obtain it.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

Perhaps when the baby was a little older, she said, it might be possible for her oldest daughters to watch him for a few hours a day so that she could work part time.“I don’t know what my plans will be,” she said. “I am just living day to day.”A system under strainImageGrazyna Swiezak, the director of the Zielony Dinek preschool in Zabki, Poland, 5 miles northeast of Warsaw.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesGrazyna Swiezak, the director of the Zielony Dinek preschool, in the middle of Zabki, said that she and her staff were happy for the opportunity to help Ukrainian children.The school anticipates that some refugee children will need emotional support, and Swiezak said she hoped to hire Ukrainian- or Russian-speaking psychotherapists to help them. But on my recent visit there, the scene seemed idyllic. In a row of sunlit classrooms, Ukrainian children played with new friends.Goodwill cannot necessarily overcome institutional limitations, however. The previous caps on preschool class sizes, for instance, were intended to ensure that children had adequate supervision. Expanding them further could jeopardize children’s education, and perhaps even their safety.And the spots created for Ukrainian children are already filling up. More than half of the new spaces at Zielony Dinek are already taken, Swiezak said. New families arrive in town every day.And if the government expands support for Ukrainian mothers without making similar efforts to meet Polish women’s needs, there is a risk of political backlash.Taped to the school’s front doors, for instance, were pages and pages of waiting lists: Polish families who had applied unsuccessfully for places at the school. Many will get spots for their children in other schools, less desirable or convenient than Zielony Dinek, but still something. But others may be left scrambling for solutions.Parents across the country are in similar positions. “Many of those people who did not have their child accepted to the kindergarten will probably now be raising the question: How come the other children are getting the new places?” Magda said.Over time, she worries, that could lead to resentment.“Some people will have understanding for the fact that these people have suffered so much, and want to help them get safe footing in the Polish territory,” she said. “But others will not care as much.”“The last thing we need is a conflict here.

After topping the charts in 2021, funds that invest in energy stocks once again turned in the strongest performance of any sector in the first quarter.But some investors wonder how much longer that streak can continue in the face of mounting uncertainty, with European leaders debating cutting off Russian imports, and as sanctions, inflation and the pandemic threaten global growth.“I don’t think I would be adding exposure to energy now,” said John Maloney, the chairman of M&R Capital Management, a New York wealth management firm. “The stocks may have more lift to them, but you don’t need to catch the last dollar of profit.”Energy funds rose 32 percent in the first three months of the year, by far the biggest return of any sector. In 2021, as demand rebounded from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, energy stock funds gained 40.9 percent, compared with the S&P 500’s climb of 26.9 percent.As is often the case, shares of energy companies took cues from oil prices. Brent crude, the closely watched global benchmark, spiked on March 7 to an intraday high of nearly $140 a barrel — its highest point since 2008 — as the United States prepared to ban Russian energy products from entering the country. It has since settled to closer to $100 a barrel, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts it trading at an average of $105 a barrel this year, well above the average of $71 in 2021.European Union leaders continue to debate how quickly and how severely to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. But even without a complete ban in Europe on Russian energy, many companies have been avoiding it. “There is a scarlet letter attached to buying from Russia,” said Tom Kloza, the global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. That could lead to higher oil prices globally.E.U. leaders have also announced ambitious plans to buy more liquefied natural gas from U.S. producers. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and the threat by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to turn off the spigot if countries won’t pay in rubles — low natural gas inventories and record prices in Europe were driving U.S. producers to send more gas there. European L.N.G. imports from the United States hit a record high in December that has since been surpassed in January and February. But there’s a catch. The United States, the world’s largest energy producer, doesn’t have much spare capacity in either oil or gas.ImageA liquefied natural gas facility in Port Arthur, Texas. The United States has little additional capacity for sending L.N.G. to Europe.Credit...Martha Irvine/Associated Press“The barrier to many Gulf Coast L.N.G. projects hasn’t been government permitting but the lack of financial backing,” said Jason Bordoff, a founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “But the Europeans sent a signal that they intend to sign more long-term contracts for L.N.G. supply, so this should help those projects reach final investment decisions.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 6:11 a.m. ETRussian missiles strike Ukraine’s railways, hours after U.S. officials’ visit to Kyiv.Putin congratulates Emmanuel Macron on his election victory in France.How Zelensky Ended Political Discord and Put Ukraine on a War FootingIt isn’t only the financial backers that have been reluctant to fund new exploration and production. Shareholders have been demanding a bigger piece of the profits after years of lousy investment returns on energy funds. A typical investor who bought an energy stock fund five years ago would only recently have broken even, according to Morningstar Direct. So the energy industry has been focusing on shareholder returns rather than pouring profits back into its businesses, a strategy the markets refer to as capital discipline.“Capital discipline isn’t just about which fields you’re going to drill,” said David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The new approach is going to the profitable fields and drilling five to seven wells, rather than 10. If you’re an energy company, you don’t want to overwhelm the world with oversupply.”In the portfolios Mr. Maloney manages for clients, he includes the Vanguard Energy exchange-traded fund. This $8.3 billion fund had returns of 39 percent in the first quarter after a management fee of 0.1 percent. Exxon and Chevron are the top two holdings, with a combined weighting of 38 percent. Exxon’s shares grew 36.5 percent in the first three months of the year; shares of Chevron rose 40.1 percent.Chevron has paused sales of certain chemicals and consumer products in Russia and says it does not have exploration or production operations there. It has a 15 percent stake in an oil pipeline that transports crude oil from Kazakhstan to a Russian terminal on the Black Sea, where shipments have continued uninterrupted. There, Kazakh oil can be blended with Russian crude, though Chevron has said its “efforts are carried out in compliance with U.S. law.”Exxon, which has done much more business in Russia, announced on March 1 that it was leaving the country and would not make further investments there, “given the current situation.” It had been operating a major exploration project in Russia’s Far East known as Sakhalin-1.Mr. Maloney said that after the run-up in share prices over the last year, he primarily viewed energy stocks as a hedge against other holdings that might move in the opposite direction, such as airlines, shippers and other companies that are sensitive to fuel prices.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/your-money/mutual-funds-and-etfs/energy-funds-russia-oil.html
63,"WASHINGTON — President Biden’s high-stakes speech in Warsaw on Saturday was crafted with the intent of throwing the full weight of the United States behind its European allies, while framing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as part of a global “battle between democracy and autocracy.”And although the forceful denunciation of President Vladimir V. Putin’s war resonated with some leaders, it was an unprompted ad-lib that captured the attention of foreign policy experts, members of Congress and NATO allies.“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Mr. Biden declared, a comment that two White House officials said was not included in the president’s prepared speech.Even as top administration officials spent Sunday walking back Mr. Biden’s remarks, the statement had already sent ripple effects throughout the world, highlighting just how powerful nine unprompted words from the president can be, particularly during a foreign policy crisis.“I wouldn’t use this kind of words,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a television interview on Sunday, when asked to comment on Mr. Biden’s speech. He said he hoped to obtain a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through diplomacy.“If we want to do this, we mustn’t escalate,” he said, “neither with words nor with actions.”Mr. Biden spent most of the speech summarizing the penalties his administration had imposed on Russia and its efforts to support refugees, while asserting that even though the United States would not send troops to Ukraine, it was prepared to defend NATO allies. Mr. Biden raised his voice when he warned Mr. Putin not to move “on one single inch” of NATO territory, a message of support for allies that the administration had intended to be one of the main takeaways from the address, according to officials.Until Mr. Biden’s unscripted moment, the speech had largely achieved its intended goals, lawmakers, allies and foreign policy experts said. But immediately afterward, Mr. Biden’s aides worried that his surprising remark might roil some of those allies the president was determined to keep unified. The White House has tried to ensure that each step taken against Russia is in line with European allies.Taken literally, the remark meant the United States would be reversing a policy of not pushing for regime change. Mr. Biden’s staff felt as if it had little choice but to play down the off-the-cuff comment.“We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Jerusalem after meeting with Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid. “In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russian people.”Michal Baranowski, a senior fellow and director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund who attended Mr. Biden’s speech, acknowledged that the president’s comment could be perceived as “a call for regime change.” But he said it was unlikely to lead to further escalation with Russia.But Republican members of Congress worried that the Kremlin, which has issued propaganda claiming the United States is determined to destroy Russia, would seize on the remark.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, described Mr. Biden’s speech as “very strong, despite the ad-lib at the end.”The comment “plays into the hands of Russian propagandists and plays into the hands of Vladimir Putin,” he said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Indeed, Moscow was quick to respond. On Saturday, Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that it was not for Mr. Biden to decide who the Russian president should be. Vyacheslav Volodin, a senior Russian lawmaker, wrote on Telegram that neither Boris N. Yeltsin nor Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who led during the Cold War, was the target of similar comments from American heads of state.“The reason for this behavior will be more professionally explained by psychiatrists,” Mr. Volodin said. “U.S. citizens should be ashamed of their president.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Mr. Biden made a “horrendous gaffe” in an otherwise good speech.“The administration has done everything they can to stop escalating — there’s not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for a regime change,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.”Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested the impromptu comment threatened to overshadow the discussions over how to continue to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russia.Most of the reaction on Sunday did not seem to significantly undermine the administration’s relationship with allies that have joined in issuing sanctions against Russia.Mr. Biden had used words “that must make Putin clearly understand that he has to stop,” Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, said on Saturday night. Mr. Biden made “a very clear speech, he used resolute words,” Mr. Di Maio said. “But let’s remember that on the other side, Putin uses bombs.”Nadhim Zahawi, Britain’s education secretary, echoed the White House’s clarification, saying he was sure that both the United States and Britain agreed that the Russian people should decide how they wished to be governed.“The Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies,” Mr. Zahawi said.And Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, suggested that Mr. Biden’s declaration was a reaction to the human cost of war he had witnessed during the three-day diplomatic trip to Europe. Noting that Mr. Biden had visited refugees before his speech in Warsaw, she said his remarks were “a principled human reaction.”But, she insisted on “State of the Union,” “the U.S. does not have a policy of regime change in Russia.

64,"KHARKIV, Ukraine — Russia plunged into a new chapter of the Ukraine war on Tuesday, intent on capturing the eastern part of the country and crushing Ukrainian defenses without the same blunders that badly damaged Russian forces in the conflict’s initial weeks.“Another phase of this operation is starting now,” Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said, as the Russian Defense Ministry announced that its missile and artillery forces had struck hundreds of Ukrainian military targets overnight.The strikes mainly hit the eastern region known as Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, where pro-Moscow separatists have battled Ukrainian forces since Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014.The Donbas has now become the stated territorial objective of Russia’s redeployed invasion force along a front that stretches roughly 300 miles, from an area near the northern city of Kharkiv to the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where die-hard Ukrainian defenders ensconced in a sprawling steel plant have repeatedly defied Russian demands to surrender.Ukraine’s military said that its forces had repulsed seven different Russian thrusts along the front on Tuesday, destroying 10 tanks and 18 armored units in the battles. The claims of both militaries could not be independently verified.Despite Russian warnings, Ukraine’s Western supporters, led by the United States, are now rushing to send longer-range weapons including howitzers, antiaircraft systems, anti-ship missiles, armed drones and even tanks — arms that American officials said were designed to thwart the Russian offensive.Western military experts said the offensive promised to be much more methodical than the blitz-like operation the Kremlin launched Feb. 24 to subjugate Ukraine, which was marked by rapid and ultimately unsuccessful advances of tanks and helicopter assaults deep inside the former Soviet republic.ImageCars passing through the war-ravaged Kyiv suburb of Horenka on Tuesday.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesThat miscalculation was compounded by flawed logistics, poor soldier morale, an unexpectedly tenacious Ukrainian resistance and Western-supplied weapons used to devastating effect on Russian armored vehicles, upending Russia’s hopes for a quick victory and forcing its military to retreat and regroup.Now, instead of lightning attacks from the Russian front lines, Moscow’s forces, focusing on taking the Donbas, have increased their long-range artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian defenders, many entrenched in earthworks established during the Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern region that began eight years ago.The Pentagon estimated that Russia now has about 75 battalion tactical groups in Ukraine, each with roughly 1,000 troops. It also has tens of thousands more troops in reserve north of Ukraine who are being resupplied and readied to join the fight, U.S. officials said.But the underlying weaknesses in Russia’s invasion force that have been exposed so far in the conflict have not necessarily gone away, military analysts said. And even with a more deliberate and cautious approach by Russia and its bigger, more powerful army, they said, the outcome in Ukraine remains unclear at best.Some American military specialists said the Russian reinforcements pouring in — including Russian mercenaries, conscripts and regular troops pulled from the country’s far east and Georgia — are deficient. They have not trained together and their combat readiness is low, officials said.Moreover, it will take time to regroup and redeploy the battered units that retreated from the north. Some will be replenished and sent back to the fight. But others are so spent that their remaining pieces will be patched together into one new unit with commanders hoping for the best in battle.As these Russian forces push west to seize more territory, they will extend their supply lines and could confront the same logistics shortfalls that bedeviled them before.“The vehicles are still poorly maintained, troop morale will remain low,” said Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe who has been involved with Ukrainian defense matters since 2016.“The outcome hinges on who can reconstitute effective forces faster than the other,” General Repass said. “Fresh faces from elsewhere in Russia aren’t going to be much use as replacements unless they are combat ready when they show up.”Russia’s battlefield mistakes have cost Moscow dearly so far. The number of Russian military losses in the war so far remains unknown, though Western intelligence agencies estimate 7,000 to 10,000 killed and 20,000 to 30,000 wounded. Thousands more have been captured or are missing.Outgunned and outnumbered, Ukraine has also had steep military losses, though the government has declined to offer specific figures even to American officials. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate 5,500 to 11,000 killed and more than 18,000 wounded, but the wide range indicates the uncertainty in the figures.Punctuated by Russia’s indiscriminate aerial bombardments, the invasion has left thousands of civilians dead or wounded, caused Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War II, deeply isolated Russia economically because of Western sanctions and turned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a pariah who has been described as a war criminal in the United States and Europe.While there have not yet been any large offensives in the Donbas region, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Tuesday that Russian forces were laying the groundwork for a future push: more surface-to-air missile systems have been shuttled to the front to protect important positions and more artillery positions have appeared.ImageLera Bronitskaya 23, right, embracing her younger sister, Sveta, 19, on Tuesday as they wait to evacuate from the Dnipro train station to Lviv, and on to Poland.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesAt this point in the war, it is clear that long-range weapons that can fire beyond sight of their targets, such as howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems, have proven important when holding and taking territory.So far, Russia’s new campaign in the Donbas appears to rely heavily on those weapons, as does Ukraine’s defense.Strikes across Ukraine over the last several days had signaled a new escalation: In Kharkiv, for instance, Russian artillery slammed into a frequently shelled residential area on Tuesday, killing at least three people. That strike followed days of blistering rocket and artillery attacks into what had been relatively unscathed parts of the city, Ukraine’s second largest.ImageRogachov Vladimir Petrovich at the scene of one of the areas bombed Tuesday in the Saltivka neighborhood of Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesOther urban centers like Zaporizhzhia in southern-central Ukraine, Lviv in the far west and Kyiv, the capital in the north, were hit with cruise missiles and artillery fire as Russian forces prepared ground troops for their thrust in the Donbas.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.The Donbas battle, on wide-open terrain, will look significantly different from the urban warfare around Kyiv, where the Russian military tried and failed to advance.This does not mean that Ukraine no longer needs the anti-tank and air-defense systems that have been so effective so far, military analysts said. In addition, the Ukrainians will need powerful arms to enable a counteroffensive of their own.The $800 million military aid package to Ukraine that President Biden announced last week for the first time included more sophisticated artillery weaponry as well as 200 armored personnel carriers. In a conference call with allies on Tuesday, Mr. Biden promised more artillery for Ukraine’s forces.“If deployed in significant numbers, these types of weapons can keep the Russian forces under withering attack, stalling their offensive momentum and potentially dislodging them from dug-in positions,” Lt. Col. Tyson Wetzel of the Air Force and Col. J.B. Barranco of the Marine Corps, wrote in an Atlantic Council analysis last week.“This phase of the conflict will be distinct from phase one, with a greater focus on offensives against dug-in combatants as opposed to Ukrainian defense against a large attacking force,” Colonels Wetzel and Barranco wrote. “The campaign is likely to become a bloody war of attrition with limited territorial gains on either side.”Capturing the besieged city of Mariupol is a key part of the Russian campaign. The fall of the city, which has come to symbolize the death and devastation wrought by the invasion, would allow Russia to complete a land bridge between Russian-held territory and the Crimean peninsula.ImageA heavily damaged apartment block on Tuesday in the Kyiv suburb of Horenka.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesA sprawling Soviet-era steel factory in Mariupol, which its designers have said was built to withstand a nuclear attack, has been sheltering thousands of soldiers and civilians and is the last Ukrainian redoubt there.Russian commanders said Tuesday they were beginning their final assault on the factory, the Azovstal steel plant, after the defenders had rejected ultimatums to surrender.

Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been on the phone, reaching out to countries with heavy artillery and weaponry: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey and Britain.Biden said the U.S. would not disclose all of the weaponry that it will be sending to Ukraine. Referencing Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line, the president said the U.S. would “speak softly and carry a large Javelin.”He also announced a ban on Russian-affiliated ships from U.S. ports, a plan to take in up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and $500 million in direct economic aid to the Ukrainian government.The effort by the U.S. and its allies to help Ukraine is sending “an unmistakable message” to President Vladimir Putin, Biden said. “He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine. He will not — that will not happen.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @nytimes channel.ImageStaff Sgt.

We will die here with weapons in our hands defending Ukraine.”Russia’s invasion has turned Mariupol, a vivacious seaside town of about half a million people, into a charred and pockmarked hellscape, the bodies of soldiers, civilians and their pets littering its once leafy avenues.Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced to Putin today that the ruined city was now fully under Russian control, save for the besieged steel plant.Kuznetsov estimated that he and his fellow soldiers could hold out for another day, perhaps two.“I ask the whole world to do everything possible to stop the military aggression against independent Ukraine,” he said. “Punish everyone who is responsible for the military action on our territory.”Buses carrying the latest evacuees from Mariupol arrived in Zaporizhzhia after a harrowing all-night drive through checkpoints manned by jumpy Russian soldiers. The evacuees described experiencing cold, hunger and weeks living in basements.

A triumphant American-born freestyle skier winning gold medals for China. The world’s top female skier trying to explain how she could not finish a race without falling.And then there was the skeleton athlete from Ukraine holding a simple sign with four words on it in front of television cameras after one of his runs down the sliding track in Yanqing.“NO WAR IN UKRAINE.”Vladyslav Heraskevych finished 18th, but he will likely be remembered for far longer than the gold medalist.“I wanted to show we are peaceful people and that we want to live normal lives,” Heraskevych, 23, said last week from his home in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, roughly 100 miles west of Kyiv, the country’s capital. “I didn’t really believe in these times a war could actually start. The Russian troops were all around Ukraine, but you also understand it is the 21st century and a war like this couldn’t happen in the middle of Europe.”What Heraskevych had thought about to the exclusion of nearly everything else during the past year — his athletic career — dropped out of his mind on Feb. 24, when the first missiles began to land and Russian tanks began to roll across the border, though he was an early voice in the campaign to have Russia banned from international sports.ImageVladyslav Heraskevych of Ukraine during the men’s skeleton final at the Beijing Winter Games, and with a sign opposing the conflict in Ukraine after his run.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York TimesImageCredit...NBC, via Associated PressA number of Ukrainian athletes — from boxers to ballet dancers — have taken up arms against Russia in recent weeks.

On one trip, the curfew forced them to pull over and sleep in the van on the side of the road.“You could hear and see the explosions so clearly,” he said. “Then you arrive and you see all these destroyed buildings.”Heraskevych has made a half-dozen trips into Kyiv. He is trying to set up a foundation so people can donate money and goods, but it has not been easy. The bureaucracy in Ukraine was never simple to navigate. The war has made it nearly impossible, with progress measured in little victories.Here was his response on WhatsApp on Friday to “How was your day today?”“The night was normal,” he wrote. “There were a couple of air danger sirens. I slept about 5-6 hours. Day was very busy, doing the work we need to do on the foundation. Today ordered an official stamp and already got it, applied for opening a bank account.

The International Olympic Committee prohibits political speech on the field of play and in other areas of competition venues but did not penalize Heraskevych.As best as he can, he is trying to keep an eye on Russia’s involvement in sports and making sure the bans that have been issued remain in place and in some cases are expanded.All of the country’s symbols have been erased from competitions, and its teams have been barred from major events, such as qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year, and team play in international tennis. However, World Athletics, the global governing body for track and field, has been one of the few organizations to prohibit individual Russian athletes, as well as those from Belarus, from competing. Athletes from those countries are barred from the World Athletics championships in Oregon this summer.Heraskevych said sports leaders needed to closely monitor anything a Russian athlete says or does that might be seen as supporting the war, and that athletes should be barred from competition for life if they supported Russia’s war in any way. He believes that since athletes have platforms, their words and deeds can quickly be used as propaganda that rallies support for the continuation of fighting and bombing that kills innocent civilians.“In doping matters, an athlete deceives others and harms his health,” he said. “In the case of war propaganda, he also deceives others, but at the same time he also destroys other people’s lives or takes their lives.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/sports/ukraine-vladyslav-heraskevych-war.html
68,"Smoke hung over the gray streets that day in Kyiv, where protesters had piled tires, furniture and barbed wire to barricade themselves from security forces. Torn blue and yellow Ukrainian flags whipped in the wind, and candles left on sidewalks marked where people had been gunned down. A drawing of a reviled president depicted as a pig was tacked to a lamp post.And yet there was a feeling of hope in Kyiv in March 2014, as Secretary of State John F. Kerry met with survivors of a violent crackdown on demonstrations. He commended the Ukrainians for their bravery in confronting a Kremlin-backed leader and promised that the United States would support the new government.But Russian forces had moved into Crimea, Ukraine’s peninsula on the Black Sea, and Mr. Kerry warned: “It is clear that Russia has been working hard to create a pretext for being able to invade further.”Eight years later, with Russian troops obliterating Ukrainian cities and towns, Mr. Kerry’s words seem eerily prescient.Through the administrations of three American presidents, the United States has sent mixed signals about its commitment to Ukraine. All the while, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia watched Washington’s moves, biding his time.“We’ve been all over the place on Ukraine,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia and Eurasia expert who advised the three administrations before President Biden. “Our own frames have shifted over time, and our own policies have shifted.”“I think we need to re-articulate why Ukraine matters,” she said.ImageA funeral for three Ukrainian soldiers in March in Lviv.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesNow, two months into Mr. Putin’s war, the United States is at the center of an extraordinary campaign to foil him, casting the military conflict as a broader battle between democratic values and authoritarian might.“It’s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War II,” Mr. Biden said in Warsaw last month. “And it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that.”The United States has rushed weapons and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and imposed sanctions intended to cut off Russia from global markets. This past weekend, Mr. Biden sent Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III to Ukraine as affirmation of Washington’s support.After a secret train ride from Poland, the two spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday about military aid. Mr. Austin said the Pentagon would expand training for Ukrainians on weapons systems; Mr. Blinken said Mr. Biden was nominating Bridget Brink, currently the ambassador to Slovakia, as his ambassador to Ukraine, the State Department said in a readout. The department is sending American diplomats back to Ukraine this week.In many ways, officials said, Mr. Biden is trying to make up for the years of U.S. indecisiveness toward Kyiv. Those who wavered earlier include top Biden aides who had worked in the Obama administration as well as officials in the administration of Donald J. Trump, who undermined U.S. policy on Ukraine for personal political gain, according to current and former officials and a review of records.The Roots of WarSince the earliest days of Ukraine’s independence, in 1991, American officials have recognized the country’s strategic value as Russia struggled to find its footing after the breakup of the Soviet Union.“Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire,” Zbigniew Brzezinski, who had been the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, wrote in a March 1994 essay. “But with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.”Two months earlier, under pressure from the United States, Ukraine had reached an agreement to destroy its nuclear arsenal. President Bill Clinton heralded the pact as “a hopeful and historic breakthrough” to improve global security. But Ukraine’s leader, President Leonid Kuchma, warned that it would make his fledgling country more vulnerable.“If tomorrow, Russia goes into Crimea, no one will raise an eyebrow,” he said that year.At the time, Moscow was already goading a separatist movement in Crimea, even as Mr. Clinton predicted that Ukraine would become a major European power.Yet over the next decade, experts said, NATO left out Ukraine to avoid angering Russia, which some members saw as an important economic partner and energy supplier and hoped would evolve into a more democratic and less threatening power.The Baltic States joined NATO in 2004, and four years later, President George W. Bush publicly backed Ukraine’s ambition to follow. But Western European nations were reluctant. Today, Ukraine is neither a NATO member nor a part of the European Union, and officials cautioned as recently as this month that its inclusion in either was far from likely.Years after Mr. Bush’s show of support, a new Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, tried to move the country closer to Russia, sparking mass protests in November 2013 when he refused to sign a long-planned agreement to strengthen ties with the European Union.That led to the crackdown in Kyiv’s streets in 2014.Security forces opened fire on protesters in central Kyiv in February that year, killing dozens. Protesters held their ground, attracting public support in Europe and the United States. Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia.“In the hearts of Ukrainians and the eyes of the world, there is nothing strong about what Russia is doing,” Mr. Kerry said during his visit to Kyiv. Within days, Mr. Putin ordered the invasion of Crimea, and he soon formally recognized it as a “sovereign and independent state.”A slow-burn war in eastern Ukraine followed, with Kyiv battling a separatist movement supported by Russian weapons and troops. An estimated 13,000 people were killed over the next eight years.ImageA supportive crowd gathered on Red Square in Moscow on the day Mr. Putin asked the Russian Parliament to accept Crimea into the Russian Federation in 2014.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesMr. Putin’s swift actions caught President Barack Obama off guard.Mr. Obama vowed the United States would never recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea and imposed economic sanctions, but his aides said in later accounts that he was skeptical of Ukraine’s corruption-ridden government.And Mr. Obama said in a 2016 interview that a showdown with Mr. Putin over Ukraine would have been futile.His administration gave more than $1.3 billion in assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016, but Mr. Obama said no when his national security team, including Mr. Biden and Mr. Kerry, recommended sending weapons to Kyiv.Among Mr. Obama’s defenders was Mr. Blinken, then the deputy secretary of state and now America’s top diplomat.By sending military aid to Ukraine, “you’re playing to Russia’s strength, because Russia is right next door,” Mr. Blinken, then the deputy secretary of state, said in early 2015.Any aid, he added, “is likely to be matched and then doubled and tripled and quadrupled by Russia.”Neither the Obama administration nor its key European allies believed Ukraine was ready to join NATO. But tensions in the alliance were growing as Europeans sought to maintain trade ties and energy deals with Russia.The division was captured in a phone call in which a senior State Department official profanely criticized European leaders’ approach to helping Ukraine. A leaked recording of the call was posted on YouTube in February 2014 in what was widely believed to be an attempt by Russia to stir up discord between the United States and Europe.Yet as much as anything else, Ukraine was a costly distraction to Mr. Obama’s broader agenda.“It was hard to reconcile the time and energy required to lead the diplomacy on Ukraine with the demands on the United States elsewhere around the world, especially after ISIS took over much of Iraq and Syria in the summer of 2014,” Derek H. Chollet, a senior Pentagon official at the time, wrote in a book about Mr. Obama’s foreign policy.Mr. Chollet is now a senior counselor to Mr. Blinken at the State Department.‘Do Us a Favor’Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian, won a landslide victory in Ukraine’s presidential elections in April 2019 after campaigning on an anti-corruption pledge.Once in office, he turned to ending the war in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine through negotiations with Mr. Putin.The new Ukrainian president “knew he needed the backing of the United States and the American president,” said William B. Taylor Jr., who started his second tour as ambassador to Ukraine that June after his predecessor, Marie L. Yovanovitch, was pushed out on Mr. Trump’s orders.Mr. Zelensky tried to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House. But Mr. Trump had negative views of Ukraine even before he took office, influenced partly by his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who had made more than $60 million consulting for a Ukrainian political party backed by Russia.Mr. Trump’s opinions were reinforced in meetings with Mr. Putin, whom he publicly admired, and Viktor Orban, the autocratic prime minister of Hungary.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.And close associates of Mr. Trump, in particular Rudolph W. Giuliani, then his personal lawyer, were urging the president to get Mr. Zelensky to open two investigations: one into Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump’s main political opponent, for actions in Ukraine related to his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings; the other based in part on a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, to help Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump embraced the theory because it undermined the finding of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had interfered to help him.But U.S. policy had been on a notably different track. Earlier, in December 2017, under pressure from his national security aides and Congress, Mr. Trump agreed to do what Mr. Obama would not: approve the sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine.But in mid-2019, the White House froze $391 million in military aid to Ukraine, including the Javelins, to build leverage for Mr. Trump’s demands, congressional investigators later found. The move hobbled Ukraine’s war effort against Russia-backed separatists.“For it to be held up, they couldn’t understand that,” Mr. Taylor said.ImagePresident Trump had negative views of Ukraine well before meeting its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in September 2019. They were bolstered by Mr. Putin, whom he publicly admired.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThat set the stage for a fateful July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. “I would like you to do us a favor,” Mr. Trump said. He requested the two investigations.Mr. Zelensky and his aides were confused. “The rest of the U.S. government was very supportive of Ukraine,” Mr. Taylor said. “But from the top, the president had a different message and set of conditions.”Mr. Zelensky scheduled a CNN interview for September to announce one or both of the investigations that Mr. Trump had requested to satisfy the American president. But the interview never happened because journalists had begun reporting on the hold on military aid, and lawmakers sympathetic to Ukraine had persisted in asking the White House about the suspended aid. On Sept. 9, three House committees announced investigations into the pressure campaign after reviewing a whistle-blower complaint citing the July call.The Trump administration released the aid on Sept. 11.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Mr. Zelensky in Kyiv on Jan. 31, 2020, the first cabinet official to do so since the announcement of an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump the previous September. The Senate trial was underway.Just days earlier, Mr. Pompeo had blown up at an NPR reporter in an interview, asking her to identify Ukraine on an unmarked map and yelling, “Do you think Americans care” about Ukraine? — using an expletive before “Ukraine.”Yet in Kyiv, Mr. Pompeo stood next to Mr. Zelensky in the presidential palace and said the U.S. commitment to support Ukraine “will not waver.”But the damage had been done, and Mr. Zelensky was unconvinced that the United States was a trusted ally, Ms. Yovanovitch said in an interview last month.“Trying to use our national security policy in order to further President Trump’s personal and political agenda was not just wrong, but it was really detrimental to the bilateral relationship,” she said. “It colored how Zelensky handled foreign policy.”With all the disruption, former U.S. officials said, Mr. Putin no doubt saw weakness in Washington.ImageEarly in his administration, President Biden did not prioritize Ukraine because of the pandemic and the U.S. economy.Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York TimesBiden vs. PutinConsumed by the pandemic and the economy, Mr. Biden did not prioritize Ukraine at first. But Mr. Blinken visited Kyiv in May 2021 with a message of support.During a steady rain, Mr. Blinken joined Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, on a walk to the Wall of National Remembrance, where photos of soldiers who had been killed in combat with Russia in the Donbas were displayed outside St. Michael’s monastery.But he also went to Kyiv with some tough love, determined to press Ukraine to make political and economic changes — a core issue for Mr. Biden when he oversaw relations with the country as vice president.Just before the visit, Mr. Zelensky’s government had replaced the chief executive of the largest state-owned energy company, whom Western officials had praised for his transparency. The State Department had chastised the move as “just the latest example” of Ukrainian leaders violating practices of good governance. In Kyiv, Mr. Blinken told reporters that he was urging Ukraine to strengthen itself by “building institutions, advancing reforms, combating corruption.”Such concerns paled in the face of Russia’s growing military threat, which Washington was watching “very, very closely,” Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Putin had begun amassing troops along Ukraine’s borders. By fall, the number approached 100,000.This past January, Mr. Blinken rushed back to Kyiv for more consultations before a hastily arranged meeting in Geneva with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in a last-ditch attempt to avert war.But Russia would not be deterred, and high-level contacts between Washington and Moscow have been severely limited ever since.By contrast, Mr. Blinken speaks frequently to Mr. Kuleba to convey American support that, at least in terms of aid, has been greater than at any time in the three decades since Ukraine declared independence.“The world is with you,” Mr. Blinken told him on March 5, stepping into Ukraine just a few feet beyond Poland’s border. “We’re in it with Ukraine — one way or another, short run, the medium run, the long run,” he said.Mr. Kuleba referred to an “unprecedented, swift reaction” to Russia’s invasion and thanked Mr. Blinken for the support.“But,” he said, “it has to be continued.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/us/politics/russia-ukraine-diplomacy.html
69,"President Volodymyr Zelensky, bolstered by an influx of heavy weapons from Western nations, expressed increasing confidence on Saturday that Ukraine was prepared to defeat Russian forces in what is expected to be a long and brutal battle for control of the eastern industrial heartland.“We will be able to show the occupiers that the day when they will be forced to leave Ukraine is approaching,” Mr. Zelensky said in an overnight address to the nation.The statement seemed to mark a decisive shift for Mr. Zelensky, who has spent months begging and shaming allies around the world to provide Ukraine with longer-range, heavy weapons to repel Russian forces as they assault the east in the latest offensive in the two-month-old war.At a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, planned to visit Kyiv, the capital, on Sunday to discuss the “military assistance we need.” They would be the highest-ranking American officials to visit since the invasion began. The Pentagon and the State Department declined to comment.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky speaking at a news conference in Kyiv on Saturday.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesWorld leaders “should not come to us with empty hands, not just presents and cakes,” Mr. Zelensky said, but with “specific weapons.”Military analysts said that the tanks, howitzers, deadly drones, armored vehicles and mountains of ammunition pouring into Ukraine from Western allies have been a significant factor in helping the country’s troops fend off the larger and better-equipped Russian military.Despite increased fighting, Russian forces have made “no major gains” in the past 24 hours, as Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder their efforts, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said on Saturday, in its latest assessment of the war.The ministry said that, despite Russia’s claim that it had conquered the heavily battered southern port of Mariupol, where the last remaining Ukrainian fighters have holed up in a steel plant with civilians, “heavy fighting” continued to frustrate Russian attempts to capture the city, slowing their progress into the Donbas region.ImageA firefighter taking cover behind a wall during a Russian bombing attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, the site of fierce fighting on Saturday.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe fighting in the eastern theater has increased the sense of urgency among Western allies to bolster Ukraine’s defenses with more powerful arms. The terrain there is mostly open farmland, which tends to favor tanks and other heavy weapons over the quick-hit, guerrilla-style tactics that the Ukrainians employed to such devastating effect in the country’s north.Canada on Friday announced that it had delivered heavy artillery, including M777 howitzers and anti-armor ammunition, to Ukrainian forces in conjunction with the United States. The shipment came after President Biden announced another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine on Thursday, saying he wanted to send the “unmistakable message” to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, that he would “never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.” At Saturday’s news conference, Mr. Zelensky reiterated his willingness to meet directly with Mr. Putin, saying while “I don’t want” to meet with him, “I have to see the president” in order to end the war. He also appealed to the Russian people, saying, “Living in the Russian Federation is like virtual reality, like a video game. Come back to the world. It’s more beautiful and more truthful.”While Russia has failed to make any significant territorial gains since launching its renewed assault in Donbas this week, the Ukrainian defense intelligence agency warned that Russian forces were trying to identify the Ukrainian military’s most vulnerable points in order to mount a larger offensive. It also said that some of the elite Russian troops who had been fighting in Mariupol had begun moving east to join the battle in Donbas.ImageThe pulverized remnants of Mariupol, Ukraine, on Friday. Despite Russian claims of having taken the city, heavy fighting continued.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersThe secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Ukraine had managed to deliver weapons via helicopter under cover of darkness to the steel plant in Mariupol, The Associated Press reported.The city has been the scene of growing desperation for the 100,000 people who are trapped there and struggling to survive under Russian occupation, said Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister. On Saturday, an aide to the city’s mayor said that Russian forces had thwarted the latest attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol.Most of the fighting over the past week has been for control of towns and villages directly on the front line, which stretches across 300 miles in Ukraine’s east and includes many communities already devastated by weeks of war.In villages and towns largely in the country’s north that have been retaken by Ukrainian troops, officials have been working with international investigators to document violence against civilians.Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said she was examining more than 8,000 reported atrocities, including summary executions, sexual violence and the forced deportation of children to Russia.Moscow shifted its focus to Donbas after failing to seize Kyiv in the north, where Russian troops were hampered by logistical and tactical problems as well as sagging morale. Those issues are likely to persist in the battle for Donbas, according to independent analysts, who said Russia did not adequately rest, reinforce or resupply its troops before beginning its latest assault.ImageUkrainian soldiers waiting in a house on Friday near Zaporizhzhia, in the Donbas region, as a Russian drone flew overhead.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesWhile Russia has been focused on seizing the east, at least eight people were killed and 18 were wounded on Saturday when two cruise missiles struck a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of the southern city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. Among the dead was a 3-month-old child, said Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential administration.Mr. Zelensky reacted angrily to the attack, denouncing Mr. Putin as “this bastard” and asking “what sort of God they believe in” that the Russians could kill a 3-month-old.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

But even as many have raced to leave Ukraine, more than one million Ukrainians have returned to the country, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs.Some have risked the journey back home after Russian forces withdrew from areas around Kyiv, bringing a sense of stability to the area and allowing some business and foreign embassies to reopen there.Poland, which has absorbed nearly three million Ukrainian refugees, more than any other country, said that nearly 24,000 crossed back into Ukraine on Saturday alone. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, shared a photograph on Twitter of cars that she said were lined up and waiting to cross from Poland into Ukraine for Orthodox Christian Easter, which will be celebrated on Sunday.“Ukrainians are coming home,” she wrote. “Easter is a time to stand united and pray for Ukraine.”ImageA priest blessing worshipers on Saturday, ahead of the Orthodox Easter celebration, at the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin in Lviv, Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O’Reilly for The New York Times Victoria Kim and Alexandra E.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the U.S. position that it was up to the Russian people to choose their leaders.Biden’s comments — which came after he called Putin a “war criminal” and “butcher” — worried some lawmakers and foreign policy experts, who said they might threaten to fracture the U.S.-led alliance and unnecessarily provoke Putin.President Emmanuel Macron of France said yesterday that he would not have used Biden’s words. The task at hand is achieving a cease-fire in Ukraine and a withdrawal of Russian troops, Macron said: “If we want to do that, we can’t escalate in either words or actions.”Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Biden had made a “horrendous gaffe.”Biden brushed aside suggestions that his comments had undermined unity among the allies. When asked today if he was ready to meet Putin, he answered: “It depends on what he wants to talk about.”ImagePresident Vladimir Putin during a New York Times interview in 2003.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesPutin, the enigmaOur Paris bureau chief, Roger Cohen, looked at President Vladimir Putin’s 22 years in power:Did the United States and its allies, through excess of optimism or naïveté, simply get Mr. Putin wrong from the outset? Or was he transformed over time into the revanchist warmonger of today, whether because of perceived Western provocation, gathering grievance, or the giddying intoxication of prolonged and — since Covid-19 — increasingly isolated rule?Mr. Putin is an enigma, but he is also the most public of figures. Seen from the perspective of his reckless gamble in Ukraine, a picture emerges of a man who seized on almost every move by the West as a slight against Russia — and perhaps also himself. As the grievances mounted, piece by piece, year by year, the distinction blurred. In effect, he became the state, he merged with Russia, their fates fused in an increasingly Messianic vision of restored imperial glory.Cohen’s analysis included insights from some of the world’s sharpest Kremlin watchers:Joschka Fischer, former German foreign minister: “Putin’s nightmare is not NATO, but democracy. It’s the color revolutions, thousands of people on the streets of Kyiv. Once he embraced an imperial, military ideology as the foundation of Russia as a world power, he was unable to tolerate this.”Condoleezza Rice, former secretary of state: “I’ve seen Putin go from a little shy, to pretty shy, to arrogant, and now megalomaniacal.” “Something is definitely different. He’s not in control of his emotions. Something is wrong.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.François Hollande, former president of France: “Putin was drunk on his success.

71,"WASHINGTON — The world economy has entered a period of intense uncertainty as a capricious pandemic and the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine combine to fuel rapid inflation and weigh on an already fragile global recovery.These colliding challenges are confronting policymakers and central bankers in the United States and Europe as they seek to bring down inflation without slowing growth so much that their economies tip into recession.In the last week, international organizations and think tanks have begun slashing their forecasts for growth and trade as they assess the war’s disruptions to global energy, food and commodity supplies, as well as China’s sweeping lockdowns to contain a renewed coronavirus outbreak.The pall over the world economy was underscored on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, which said in its World Economic Outlook that global output was expected to slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That is a downgrade from a January forecast of 4.4 percent growth this year.“Global economic prospects have been severely set back, largely because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the I.M.F.’s chief economist, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. “This crisis unfolds as the global economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.”The impact of Russia’s war on the global economy will be a central topic for policymakers convening in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.As the meetings got underway, policymakers grappled with how to maintain pressure on Russia while keeping the economic recovery on track and protecting the world’s poor from rising prices. While some countries that export commodities will benefit from a period of higher fuel and food prices, for most economies the disruptions weigh heavily.“The war has made an already dire situation worse,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a speech about rising food insecurity on Tuesday. “Price and supply shocks are already materializing, adding to global inflationary pressures, creating risks to external balances, and undermining the recovery from the pandemic.”On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen plans to attend an opening session that will include Ukraine’s finance minister as the United States looks to stand with allies in opposition to Russia’s invasion, a Treasury official said. However, Ms. Yellen will not attend some Group of 20 sessions, such as those on international financial architecture and sustainable finance, if Russians are participating.Against that backdrop, the I.M.F.’s new data revealed a daunting set of economic headwinds. Mr. Gourinchas said the war was slowing growth and spurring inflation, which he described as a “clear and present danger” for many countries. He added that disruptions to Russian supplies of oil, gas and metals, along with Ukrainian exports of wheat and corn, will ripple through commodities markets and across the global economy “like seismic waves.”He acknowledged that the trajectory of the global economy would depend on how the war proceeded and the ultimate breadth of the sanctions that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia imposed on Russia.“Uncertainty around these projections is considerable, well beyond the usual range,” Mr. Gourinchas said. “Growth could slow down further while inflation could exceed our projections if, for instance, sanctions extend to Russian energy exports.”Ukraine and Russia are facing the most dire economic consequences from the war. The I.M.F. expects the Ukrainian economy to contract by 35 percent this year, while Russia’s economy is projected to shrink 8.5 percent. Mr. Gourinchas noted that the Russian authorities had so far managed to prevent a collapse of their financial system and avoided bank failures but said further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy industry could have a significant impact on its economy.The sweeping sanctions that America and its allies have already imposed on Russia are the main factor contributing to the downward revision of the I.M.F.’s global growth outlook, Mr. Gourinchas said. He added that a tightening of restrictions on Russian energy exports would be an “adverse scenario” that would further slow output around the world.Rising prices around the world show no signs of abating, the I.M.F. said, even if supply chain problems ease. It expects inflation to remain elevated throughout the year, projecting it at 5.7 percent in advanced economies and 8.7 percent in emerging markets. Inflation hit 8.5 percent in the United States last month, the fastest 12-month pace since 1981.ImageAn empty street in Shanghai this week. The World Bank warned that the lingering pandemic and Covid-19 lockdowns in China could amplify income inequality and poverty rates.Credit...Aly Song/ReutersOther international organizations and research groups have also pared back their global growth forecasts. Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, expect global growth to decline from a rapid 5.8 percent in 2021 to 3.3 percent annually in 2022 and 2023.The World Bank also expressed alarm this week about the state of the global economy, warning that the lingering pandemic, Covid-19 lockdowns in China and higher inflation could amplify income inequality and poverty rates. It lowered its 2022 growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 4.1 percent.“I’m deeply concerned about developing countries,” David Malpass, the World Bank president, said on Monday. “They’re facing sudden price increases for energy, fertilizer and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.”According to the Bank for International Settlements, more than half of emerging economies have inflation rates above 7 percent. And 60 percent of “advanced economies,” including the United States and the euro area, have inflation over 5 percent, the largest share since the 1980s, the bank said.In Britain, inflation climbed to 7 percent in March, the highest level in 30 years.An April 12 survey of global investors by BofA Securities found that more than two-thirds were pessimistic about global growth prospects in the months ahead.The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.Several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are trying to tame rapid inflation by raising interest rates and removing other pandemic-era economic support. Whether policymakers can succeed in taking the heat out of the economy without triggering a recession remains to be seen.Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Board, said that underlying demand in the United States remained strong, because of the savings accumulated by consumers during the pandemic and their pent-up desire for spending.“Demand will be and will need to be restrained by the removal of monetary accommodation,” she said. “And this has become very clear in recent months.”In addition to the war, the pandemic and rising interest rates, China is facing a downturn in its property sector, and the Brazilian economy could be damaged by political turmoil related to coming elections, she said.New data show that Chinese economic growth and retail sales are flagging, as the government imposes sweeping lockdowns to stamp out the coronavirus. By April 11, 87 of China’s 100 largest cities had imposed some form of restriction on movement, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm.The restrictions are again disrupting global supply chains for electronics, car parts and other goods, and dampening Chinese imports of oil, food and consumer goods. China is the world’s largest oil importer, and cooling demand there caused the International Energy Agency last week to trim its forecasts for oil demand growth this year to 1.9 million barrels a day, from an increase of 5.6 million barrels a day last year.The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed to punish Moscow, also threaten to tip European economies into recession. Last week, forecasters at Germany’s top economic institutes projected that a full European ban on Russian energy imports would cause German output to contract 2.2 percent next year and push inflation up to 7.3 percent, a record for postwar Germany.Global trade growth is also expected to slow this year. The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade volumes to expand 3 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4.7 percent. But depending on how the pandemic and the war unfold, trade growth could be as low as 0.5 percent or as high as 5.5 percent, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the organization’s director general, said in a news conference last Tuesday.The group forecast that global trade growth would rebound to 3.4 percent next year, though those estimates are also subject to change.Dr. Okonjo-Iweala said the war prevented the organization’s economists from gathering key data on economic output, forcing them to rely on in-house simulations of how sanctions on Russian, the devastation of Ukrainian infrastructure, and the broader erosion of business and consumer confidence would affect global growth, she said.“The economic reverberations of this conflict will extend far beyond Ukraine’s borders,” she said. “It is now clear that the double whammy of the pandemic and the war has disrupted supply chains, increased inflationary pressures, and lowered expectations for output and trade growth.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/business/economy/imf-world-economy-inflation.html
72,"Mark Vande Hei, a NASA astronaut, returned to Earth on Wednesday with two Russian counterparts, landing in Kazakhstan after he spent 355 days in space.Mr. Vande Hei and his Russian crewmates, Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, flew home together in a Russian spacecraft, guided by Russian flight controllers. After touching down on a grassy plain at 5:28 p.m. local time, or 7:28 a.m. Eastern time, Mr. Vande Hei was met by a contingent of NASA and Russian personnel, a close collaboration between the two space agencies that has continued despite Russia’s deadly invasion of Ukraine and the tensions it has caused between Moscow and the West.The three men emerged in a world where cooperation between Russia and the United States to preserve the future of the International Space Station can no longer be taken for granted.The space station was meant to be a marvel of peaceful post-Cold War amity between Moscow and Washington, drawing Russia into the community of international collaboration and preventing Russian rocket engineers from selling expertise to countries like North Korea seeking to build better missiles.But in the past month, Russia has faced withering sanctions, condemnation and growing isolation from Western nations. President Biden harshly condemned President Vladimir V. Putin for the invasion.NASA has tried to stay above the fray for the past month with minimal statements saying that operations on the space station are unaffected. And the astronauts say publicly that they are inclined to steer around the rupture between their governments. But the ongoing military conflict could test NASA’s ability to continue working with Roscosmos, the state corporation that runs Russia’s space activities.ImageA Russian Soyuz capsule landed in Kazakhstan Wednesday, returning one American and two Russian astronauts from the International Space Station.Credit...NASAIn Kazakhstan on Wednesday, the Soyuz capsule landed upright, but as often happens, winds dragged the parachute and pulled the capsule over on its side. Within half an hour, recovery teams helped all three astronauts out of the Soyuz.After a journey of 5,680 orbits of Earth that stretched more than 150 million miles, Mr. Vande Hei was greeted by NASA flight doctors, public affairs officials and representatives from the astronaut’s office and the space station management. The astronauts first sat outside, drinking tea during initial medical tests. Mr. Vande Hei smiled broadly and gave a thumbs up before putting on a protective mask. He took off a pair of sunglasses, commenting that it was a beautiful day. As he and the two Russian crew were carried into an inflatable tent for more medical checks, Mr. Vande Hei spoke with someone on a satellite phone.Following their stay in the tents, the astronauts were to take a two-hour flight on Russian helicopters to the city of Karaganda. There Mr. Vande Hei and the American delegation were expected to a board a NASA Gulfstream jet and head back to the United States, with one stop in Germany for refueling.While NASA and Roscomos worked together Wednesday to bring their crew members back from orbit, their cooperation was preceded in recent weeks by bellicose outbursts from Dmitry Rogozin, who leads the Russian space program. He shared a video on Twitter that suggested the Russians might leave Mr. Vande Hei behind.NASA officials have carefully sidestepped what Mr. Rogozin has said and insisted that nothing has changed.“For the safety of our astronauts, the working relationship between NASA and our international partners continues,” Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator, said during his State of NASA speech on Monday. “And that includes the professional relationship between the cosmonauts and our astronauts.”On Tuesday, Mr. Shkaplerov, one of the returning Russian astronauts, turned over command of the space station to Tom Marshburn of NASA. “We are one crew,” Mr. Shkaplerov said during the ceremony, which ended with hugs.While NASA remains mum, Scott Kelly, a retired astronaut who held the record for consecutive days in space by an American until Mr. Vande Hei passed it recently, feuded on Twitter this month with Mr. Rogozin. He stopped at NASA’s request.Outside of the space station, Russian and European cooperation has all but collapsed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The European Space Agency postponed a rover mission to Mars because it relied on a Russian rocket. And a British satellite internet company, OneWeb, canceled a series of launches that used Russia’s Soyuz rockets, shifting some of them to SpaceX rockets. Russia also said it would cease cooperative science experiments with Germany conducted on the Russian part of the space station. A German astronaut, Matthias Maurer, is currently a member of the crew.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Orbital construction of the International Space Station, a cooperative venture between the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada, began in 1998 with the launch of the module Zarya. Financed by NASA and built by Russia, it is actually part of the NASA-led half of the space station reflecting American foreign policy at the time, which sought to sustain Russia’s space program during the economic tumult after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian and American astronauts permanently moved into the fledging space station on Nov. 2, 2000, and it has been continuously occupied by rotating crews of astronauts ever since.The Russian and NASA-led segments of the station are separate but tightly connected. The Russians rely on American solar panels for power while Russian cargo ships provide periodic boosts to keep the station from falling into the atmosphere. It is “not really an operation that you can separate and go your own way,” said Joel Montalbano, the program manager for the space station at NASA, during a news conference a couple of weeks ago.Mr. Montalbano said of the conflict in Ukraine, “We’re aware of what’s going on, but we are able to do our jobs to continue operations.”ImageMark Vande Hei of NASA and Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov of Roscosmos inside a Soyuz spacecraft after landing in Kazakhstan on Wednesday.Credit...Bill Ingalls/NASA, via Getty ImagesThe astronauts also may be circumspect when talking with one another in orbit. In February, before Russian troops entered Ukraine, Mr. Vande Hei told KARE, a Minnesota television station, that the crew got along “fantastically” and that Ukraine was not a frequent topic of conversation.“All I can say is we haven’t talked about that too much,” Mr. Vande Hei said. “I’m not sure we really want to go there.”But Mr. Kelly, who spent 340 days on the space station in 2015 and 2016, said that if he were still in orbit, he would likely discuss the conflict with his Russian counterparts.“Russia moved into Syria when were there,” he said in an interview. He and his Russian crewmates even talked about the possibility of direct armed conflict between the United States and Russia but it was at an abstract, not personal level.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We all recognizee what was important to us at that time was supporting each other,” Mr. Kelly said. “Literally relying on each other for our lives if the situation warranted.”In an interview recorded last week but streamed on NASA Television on Wednesday, Mr. Vande Hei referred indirectly to the war in Ukraine.“This is a very challenging time for international relations,” Mr. Vande Hei said. “My hope is that in our attempt to further and find peace throughout the world, that these type of connections that we have can be maintained and serve as a path forward.”April will be a busy month of comings and goings at the space station. As early as April 6, private company, Axiom Space of Houston, will lead three space tourists to the orbital lab. They paid $55 million each for the experience.Later in April, another crew of four astronauts — three from NASA, one from Italy — are to launch on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket to the space station.The longer-term future of the International Space Station remains unclear. The current agreement between the partner nations extends through 2024. NASA would like to extend operations until 2030 as it tries to support companies that want to launch future commercial outposts in orbit. Russia has not agreed to the extension, suggesting that it might want to set off on its own instead. It may also seek to collaborate with China in space.However, it is unclear how much Roscosmos can do with limited financing that will get tighter as it cuts off contracts from foreign countries.Russia also no longer brings in money flying NASA astronauts to orbit. For nearly a decade after the space shuttle was retired, Russia’s Soyuz was the only way Americans could get to and from the space station. NASA now uses on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, and a second spacecraft by Boeing, Starliner, could start flying astronauts late this year.NASA would still like to fly some of its astronauts on the Soyuz, but instead of paying for the flights, it wants to trade seats on the American spacecraft for Russian astronauts. While Russian astronauts are still training in Houston, NASA and Roscosmos have not yet completed an agreement for such a swapping of seats. And negotiations have been slowed by other U.S.-Russian disputes, including the aftermath of a Russian antisatellite weapon test in November.Mr. Vande Hei and his Russian crewmates won’t only be adjusting to the world’s changing geopolitics. It might take a little while to get used to gravity again.“You’re nauseous,” said Mr. Kelly, recalling own his recovery after nearly a year of floating. “You’re dizzy, you’re tired. You’re sore.Mr. Kelly said the most striking effects were in his cardiovascular system, with blood and fluid pooling in his lower legs.“I can’t speak for everyone else, but that was the most troubling thing” he said. “Standing up and just physically seeing your ankles get like twice as big.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/science/nasa-us-russia-mark-vande-hei.html
73,"As Western leaders introduced sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, said seizing personal property from Russian oligarchs went too far.“No American government had ever done anything like that before,” he said.While the segment was aimed at Fox News’s conservative audience, it found another audience in Russia. The argument was parroted beat by beat by RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, which wrote that “the average U.S. citizen is simply horrified by what is happening.” window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008280351""); if (!window.Promise || !window.fetch || !window.URL) { document.write('<script src=""https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2022/03/30/disinfo-russia-fox/8cdc58b4ed50e9ce0a26be98d14ec32ad636753e/polyfills.js""><\/script>'); } (function() { window.NYTG = window.NYTG || {}; window.NYTG.ASSETS = ""https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2022/03/30/disinfo-russia-fox/8cdc58b4ed50e9ce0a26be98d14ec32ad636753e/"".slice(0, -1); window.NYTG.BIG_ASSETS = ""https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2022/03/30/disinfo-russia-fox/assets/"".slice(0, -1); var supports_import = false; var can_use_import = location.hostname.indexOf('preview.n' + 'yt.net') == -1; var shimport_url = window.NYTG.ASSETS + ""/shimport@1.0.1.js""; var shimport_promise; try { new Function(""if(0)import('')"")(); supports_import = true; } catch(e) { } if (!can_use_import || !supports_import) { shimport_promise = new Promise(function(fulfil, reject) { var s = document.createElement(""script""); s.src = shimport_url; s.onload = function() { fulfil(__shimport__); }; s.onerror = reject; document.head.appendChild(s); }); } window.NYTG.load = function(module) { var url = new URL(module, location.href).href; if (can_use_import && supports_import) { return eval(""import('"" + url + ""')""); } else { return shimport_promise.then(function(shimport) { return shimport.load(url); }); } }; // for --live window.NYTG.subscribers = {}; window.NYTG.watch = function(url, cb) { if (!window.NYTG.subscribers[url]) window.NYTG.subscribers[url] = []; window.NYTG.subscribers[url].push(cb); window.NYTG.load(url).then(cb); }; }()); (function() { // Check for template type: standard, minimal, or blank var templateType = ""template-"" + ("""" || ""standard""); // Check for icon style options var templateStyle = ""template-option-"" + ("""" || ""black-icons""); // Check for dark mode flag var isDarkMode = """".match(/y|yes|true/) !== null; var darkMode = (isDarkMode) ?

Along the way, Russian media has increasingly seized on Fox News’s prime-time segments, its opinion pieces and even the network’s active online comments section — all of which often find fault with the Biden administration — to paint a critical portrait of the United States and depict America’s foreign policy as a threat to Russia’s interests. Mr. Carlson was a frequent reference for Russian media, but other Fox News personalities — and the occasional news update from the network — were also included.Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who has made several false claims about the war — including that Russia never attacked Ukraine — singled out Fox News for praise last month.“We understood long ago that there is no such thing as an independent Western media,” Mr. Lavrov told the state television station RT, adding that “only Fox News is trying to present some alternative point of view.”Mentions of Fox News in Russian-language media grew 217 percent during the first quarter of this year compared with the final quarter of last year, as news coverage of Ukraine increased, according to an analysis by Zignal Labs, a media tracking company that reviewed social media posts, broadcast media and online websites. CNN, which has about three times the global viewership of Fox News, according to the tracking company Similarweb, was mentioned more often but grew less, by 71 percent.Fox News in Russian MediaWeekly mentions of Fox News on Russian-language media surged before and during the invasion of Ukraine. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008278961""); Note: Includes social media, cable television, and print and online outlets.Source: Zignal LabsBy The New York TimesWhen reached for comment, a Fox News spokeswoman pointed to segments in which Mr. Carlson was critical of Russia and its president, Vladimir V.

It found new resonance during the invasion of Ukraine.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.After a Senate hearing on the matter, in which Victoria Nuland, an under secretary of state, confirmed the existence of biolabs in Ukraine, Mr. Carlson used his show to suggest that the U.S. government was being untruthful about conducting bioweapons work in the country. Russian media seized on the segment.“The U.S. baselessly accused Russia of spreading disinformation about biolabs in Ukraine because they later actually confirmed their existence, TV presenter Tucker Carlson told Fox News,” Radio Sputnik wrote in an article summarizing Mr. Carlson’s lengthy segment for a Russian audience.3.

77,"LVIV, Ukraine — From her bearing and demeanor, the college instructor waiting at the Lviv bus station appeared to be accustomed to respect and, judging by her fur-trimmed coat and pink mohair hat adorned with a sparkling pin, used to a certain elegance.But after two weeks on the road as a refugee with her daughter and 1-year-old grandson, she had had enough.In Poland and the Czech Republic, Oksana, who did not want to give her last name, said she was just another refugee in a shelter who did not speak the language.“Nobody needs us,” she said. “Nobody needs teachers. Knowing the Czech language is obligatory. They would be ready to take me as a cleaning lady, but even then I would need to find a place to live.”Now she and her family were joining the growing number of Ukrainians who were returning home.For the first time since the Russian invasion six weeks ago, an increasing number of travelers coming through the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and other transit hubs are returning home rather than fleeing.There are still far more citizens leaving their homes. But according to travelers and officials, the surge in returnees reflects a growing belief that the war could last years, and a willingness to live with a measure of danger rather than live as a refugee in another country, bereft of home and community.ImageThe central train station in Lviv, on Monday: a growing number of travelers are returning to Ukraine rather than fleeing it.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesIt also highlights the difficulties European countries have had providing for Ukrainians in the continent’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.“The statistics have changed a lot recently,” Yurii Buchko, the deputy military administrator for Lviv, said in an interview. “In the beginning of the war 10 times the number of people left as those who returned.” Now, he said, on some days half of those crossing the border in Lviv Province were returning home rather than leaving.The returnees are largely women and children. Most Ukrainian men of military age with fewer than three children were banned from leaving the country at the start of the war. At the border with Poland, virtually all the drivers of civilian cars crossing the border are women. The trains and bus stations are packed with women and children.“People have now understood what war is like and that even with war, you can stay and live in Ukraine, in Lviv,” Mr. Buchko said. “They left at the beginning because of the panic, but they have family members still here.”He said Ukrainians were also returning to go back to work as more shops and businesses reopened.On Saturday, a fairly typical day, 18,000 Ukrainians left the country, while 9,000 crossed back again through border posts in his province, he said. He said that while some were traders transporting goods, many were Ukrainian families intending to go home. Figures from Ukraine’s border guard confirm the trend.More than four million Ukrainians have fled the country since the war began, and more than seven million have fled their homes but remained in Ukraine.ImagePassengers boarding a train in Lviv on Monday.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesMany who stayed in the country had evacuated to Lviv and to other cities and towns closer to the Polish border, which were thought to be safer than cities in the south and east.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Recent rocket attacks in Lviv, including on a military training base and an oil installation, killed several dozen people but for the most part the city has remained untouched.Travelers and officials said that some people were returning to the capital, Kyiv, because of the Russian retreat there.At Lviv’s ornate century-old train station, Valeria Yuriivna stood on the platform about to board a train to Mykolaiv, which remains under heavy fire from Russian airstrikes.

78,"Destroyed tanks and body parts are all that are left of a Russian advance, part of the larger battle to block the invaders’ attempt to enter or encircle the capital.NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS OF KYIV, Ukraine — When Ukrainian forces hit a Russian tank with an American-made Javelin missile on a highway on the northern reaches of the capital, Kyiv, the explosion was so huge that it tossed the turret 10 yards down the road and shredded the rest of the vehicle and the men inside.The charred body parts of Russian soldiers were still decomposing on the asphalt three weeks later, alongside scattered metal debris and ammunition. A single felt boot, favorite footwear for centuries in Russia’s frozen villages, lay blackened among the detritus.“Good shot,” the Ukrainian commander said with elation, surveying the wreck. A deputy commander of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, which controlled the area, he asked that he be identified only by his nom de guerre, Sulim. He pointed to blackened chunks of human flesh and bone on the road from Russian soldiers killed in the strike, and added, “It was all humane, it was all very quick.”“They came four times,” Commander Sulim, 40, said. “Let them come again. I am waiting.”ImageThe wreckage of a Russian T-72 tank on a highway leading into Kyiv.ImageThe identity tag of a Russian soldier on the ground near a destroyed Russian armored vehicle.The Russian Army has come, again and again, trying to penetrate villages and suburbs around Kyiv for weeks, in what has become a seesaw battle for the critical areas that could be used to enter or encircle and eventually shell the capital.Ukrainian media officers escorted several teams of journalists on a rare visit through villages close to Russian lines in the countryside of greater Kyiv on Friday to show some of the damage from early fighting, as well as the success of the Ukrainian resistance and the counterattacks Ukraine’s military has mounted.The villages visited were not among those recently liberated by the continuing Ukrainian counteroffensive, but they had come under attack as Russian forces had tried to seize them two weeks ago. Similar battles are now being waged daily.This spot on the edge of a village, on a highway leading into Kyiv, marked the limit of the Russian advance in the area under Commander Sulim’s watch. Two tanks — a T-90 that was hit by the Javelin and a T-72 — according to the commander, were ambushed on the road on March 2 during the first week of the war. A half-dozen burned-out armored vehicles lay nearby — beside a cluster of houses and in a gully — wrecks from several skirmishes over the period of a week.ImageWhen a Russian Iskander missile landed near Yuriy Yunevich’s house, the walls were buckled and the roof was shorn off.Image“Everything is destroyed,” said Valerii, a farmer. “It was in the morning,” he added. “I had just fed the animals when the tank came. It was about 100 yards from me. I hid.”Russian forces were still just four miles away, but the commander asked that the village names not be published to safeguard his positions.The villages on the front line were mostly deserted, with just a few men and women guarding houses and looking after their livestock. The first line of houses facing the road where the tank battle happened were badly damaged from artillery or tank shells.A farmer, Valerii, 62, who kept cows and sheep in a property below the road said he had lost half of his animals in the fighting. “Everything is destroyed,” he said forlornly. “It was in the morning,” he added. “I had just fed the animals when the tank came. It was about 100 yards from me. I hid.” He gave only his first name so as not to be further identified.Later he ran into some Russian scouts in the woods and they had let him go, he said, but he was close to tears at the state of his farm.“They come to our house and are trying to impose their orders,” he said of the Russians. “How can they? They should not do that. How can I go into your house and tell you what to do? I come to you, and I should behave according to your rules.”ImageA Ukrainian soldier keeping watch on a road at a front-line position in the northern outskirts of Kyiv.ImageUkrainian soldiers manning a checkpoint at a front-line position on the outskirts of Kyiv.The commander said they had found 10 bodies of Russian soldiers from the battle. “There were no prisoners,” he said.

In the gully where two armored personnel carriers had crashed and burned, a military sleeping bag and jacket lay beside one wreck, along with discarded rations and scattered ammunition.As he walked through the wreckage, the commander picked up a soldier’s silver dog tag. It bore the number 785 000 and the imprint of the Soviet Army — VS U.S.S.R. He picked up an empty army satchel, with a tag with the name A.G. Gagarin on it and his unit number, 666. “They did not succeed,” he said grimly. “Gagarin is OK, he is dead.”Several soldiers at the scene voiced thanks to the United States for providing Javelin portable antitank missiles and to Britain for sending NLAWs, Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapons. Yet despite their success in ambushing the Russian armored vehicles and tanks, the Ukrainian troops were wary of the firepower of the Russian Army and kept the visit to their positions short.Image“The Russians are bombing civilians, women and children,” said Sulim, a deputy commander of Ukraine’s 72nd Mechanized Brigade. “Would you want us to bomb you?” he asked of the Russian population.ImageCasings of Russian ammunition.Ukrainian artillery sounded close by as it fired at Russian positions to the north.

He said he had often interacted with Russian officers after fighting began in eastern Ukraine in 2014.He told them that if Russia had offered a better life, he would have readily supported a union between the two countries. “But it’s not good,” he said. “The officers agreed with me. They are not living well there. They live in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but everywhere else they just survive.”At a second village, two powerful Russian missiles had gouged yards-wide craters beside the road, smashing houses and farm buildings in a wide arc. Two Iskander ballistic missiles had struck the village in the first week of the war, Ukrainian military officers said. The missiles were possibly aimed at Ukrainian military positions in the village, but they primarily damaged people’s homes and farms.ImageThe Russian missiles that struck a village may have been intended for Ukrainian military positions, but they appeared to primarily damage people’s homes and farms.ImageMr. Yunevich said he rejected any thought of living in peace under the Russians. “This is our land,” he said.Yuriy Yunevich, 51, and his family had been asleep at home when the missiles hit at 3 a.m., one just yards from their house. “Everything was thrown like a wave,” he said.

His greenhouses were ripped apart, and the cows were lying down amid the broken bricks of their stalls.He sent his wife and children away after that but said he could not leave, because his cows had to be milked and fed, and his German shepherd was expecting puppies soon.

79,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces redoubled attacks on strategic targets across Ukraine on Sunday, with fierce fighting reported around the capital, Kyiv, amid signs that the besieged city of Mariupol was close to falling.As the conflict moved into its second month, Russian forces have largely failed in their first aim to take the largest cities and have narrowed immediate targets to the sieges of the southern port city of Mariupol and the strategically placed city of Chernihiv in the north.Air raid sirens rang out in Kyiv during the day, but otherwise the city remained calm, lending some credence to the Russian Defense Ministry’s recent assertion that it was turning its focus away from Kyiv to concentrate on the eastern front. Some Russian units were withdrawing to Belarus in the north to regroup and re-equip, according to the Ukrainian military, but heavy Russian artillery attacks continued around Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv.Seven people, including two children, died in artillery fire in Kharkiv, in northeast Ukraine, as Russian forces tried to subdue the city near the border, the Ukrainian news media reported. And missiles hit a fuel depot in western Ukraine as Russia continued to use airstrikes to disrupt supply lines to Ukrainian forces.Ukraine’s top military intelligence officer suggested that Russia was changing its military focus to the south and east and might be trying to divide Ukraine between occupied and nonoccupied territories.“In fact, this is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,” said Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the intelligence division of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense.ImageFlattened buildings in Byshiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv, on Sunday.Credit...Rodrigo Abd/Associated PressFighting across the country showed Russian forces were working to consolidate their positions in key spots north of Kyiv and resisting Ukrainian attempts to break their grip there while focusing fully on seizing control of Mariupol. After weeks of siege in the port city, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians trapped there were facing increasingly dire conditions, without food and water, forcing people to use untreated sewage water to survive.Western military analysts and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly emphasized that Russian forces have suffered heavy losses and have been thwarted in their primary objectives: to wrest control of the country’s main cities, including Kyiv. Struggling with difficulties in their supply lines, Russian forces are having to move slowly and focus on one target at a time, said Jack Watling, a research fellow and specialist in land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in Britain.Still, Ukrainian forces, despite their successes in ambushing and stalling Russian units around the country, have not been able to reverse Russian gains in any significant way, he added.In an interview with Russian journalists on Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that Russian forces had entered parts of Mariupol and that he had told Ukrainian soldiers still holding out there that they could abandon the city to save their own lives.“I talk to them twice a day,” he said. “I told them, ‘If you feel that you need to get out and that it is right, that you can survive, then do it. I understand.’”He added that the officers refused to go because they did not want to leave dead and wounded comrades and civilians behind. He made the remarks in an interview with several independent journalists that was published on the YouTube channel Zygar.ImageA soldier backed by Russia passed people waiting to leave Mariupol on Sunday.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersMr. Watling said he did not expect Ukrainian forces to hold Mariupol any longer than a few days more.“They ran out of water, they ran out of food a while ago,” he said. “Exhausted troops on sewage water — you cannot fight long on that.”He added that he expected an insurgency to continue in the city after it falls.As the war ground on, its physical toll on Ukraine was becoming more apparent. An estimated $63 billion in Ukrainian infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed as of last Thursday, Ukraine’s Parliament said in a Twitter post on Sunday.The losses include more than 4,400 residential buildings, 138 health care facilities, eight civilian airports and 378 educational institutions. The cost was calculated by the Kyiv School of Economics.After a month of intense fighting near Kyiv, some Russian military units were withdrawing to Belarus to regroup, traveling through the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, the Ukrainian military said.“These measures are taken to rotate units that have suffered significant losses, strengthen existing groups, replenish food, fuel and ammunition and evacuate wounded and sick soldiers,” the military said in a statement.It also said that the Russian Army was using the site of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor for logistics. Russian troops have blockaded the town of Slavutich, which is close to the Chernobyl station, and have escalated attacks on Chernihiv in an apparent attempt to consolidate a band of control north of the capital.Ukraine’s chief negotiator at peace talks with Russia said a new round of negotiations would take place this week, starting Monday in Turkey, a NATO member that has used President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s good relations with both Russia and Ukraine to try to mediate a solution to the conflict. But Turkish officials have conceded that any agreement between the two parties remains distant.ImageA Ukrainian soldier inspecting a destroyed Russian T-72 tank in Lukianivka, near Kyiv, on Sunday.Credit...Serhii Nuzhnenko/ReutersMr. Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, predicted the Ukrainian Army would repel Russian forces as the fighting descended into an all-out guerrilla war.“The season of a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari will soon begin,” he said. “Then there will be one relevant scenario left for the Russians: how to survive.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.More than 1,100 civilians have been killed since the war in Ukraine began, including at least 99 children, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in a report released Sunday that cautioned that the actual figures might be “considerably higher.” An additional 1,790 civilians have been wounded, including 126 children, the report added.With many areas of Ukraine still bogged down by the conflict, many of the dead and wounded cannot be counted, the United Nations said. Left out of the U.N. report was the besieged city of Mariupol, where Russian forces hit a theater this month that hundreds of civilians were using as a bomb shelter, killing some 300 people, according to local officials.As President Biden returned home from a visit with NATO allies in Europe and with Ukrainian refugees in Poland, President Zelensky urged him and other Western leaders to give Ukraine tanks, planes and missiles to help fend off Russian forces.“Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles with shotguns, with machine guns,” he said. “And it is impossible to break the blockade in Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft.”“Thousands of people — citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade — know that,” he added. “The United States knows it. All European politicians know it. We have told everyone.”ImageThe interior of the Regional State Administration office in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Sunday.Credit...Roman Pilipey/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Zelensky’s remarks came as American officials scrambled Sunday to clarify that the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, after Mr. Biden said at the end of a speech in Poland on Saturday that Russia’s leader, Vladimir V.

Blinken said the president had simply meant Mr. Putin could not be “empowered to wage war” against Ukraine or anywhere else.French and British officials distanced themselves from Mr. Biden’s remarks. When asked about them in an interview on Sunday, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would not use such language, adding that there should be no escalation — in words or actions.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko from Istanbul, Maria Varenikova from Kyiv, Marc Santora from Krakow, Poland, Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong and Valerie Hopkins from Lviv, Ukraine.

What if a place was unfree, but also happy? How long could it stay that way?Moscow had blossomed into a beautiful, European city, full of meticulously planted parks, bike lanes and parking spaces. Income for the average Russian had risen significantly over the course of the previous decade. At the same time, its political system was drifting ever closer to authoritarianism.Fifteen years earlier, Boris Yeltsin had left power in shame, apologizing on national television “for having failed to justify the hopes of the people who believed that we would be able to make a leap from the gloomy and stagnant totalitarian past to a bright, prosperous and civilized future at just one go.”By the summer of 2015, his successor, President Vladimir V. Putin, had seemingly made Russia bright and prosperous. The political system he built was increasingly restrictive, but many had learned to live with it.Many Russian liberals had gone to work for nonprofits and local governments, throwing themselves into community building — making their cities better places to live. A protest movement in 2011 and 2012 had failed, and people were looking for other ways to shape their country. Big politics were hopeless, the thinking went, but one could make a real difference in small acts.There was another side to this bargain: Mr. Putin was seemingly constrained, as well. Political action may have been forbidden, but there was tolerance when it came to other things, for example religion, culture and many forms of expression. His own calculus for the system to run smoothly meant he had to make some room for society.ImageMoscow in February, before the start of the war.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesI lived in Russia for nine years, and began covering it for The New York Times in 2000, the year Mr. Putin was first elected. I spent lots of time telling people — in public writing and in my private life — that Russia might sometimes look bad, but that it had a lot of wonderful qualities, too.But in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, I have felt like I am watching someone I love lose their mind. Many of the Russian liberals who had turned to “small acts” are feeling a sense of shock and horror, too, said Alexandra Arkhipova, a Russian anthropologist.“I see lots of posts and conversations saying these small deeds, it was a big mistake,” she said. “People have a metaphor. They say, ‘We were trying to make some cosmetic changes to our faces, when the cancer was growing and growing in our stomachs.’”I began to wonder whether Russia was always going to end up here, and we just failed to see it. So I called Yevgeniya Albats, a Russian journalist who had warned of the dangers of a K.G.B. resurgence as early as the 1990s. Ms. Albats kept staring into the glare of the idea that at certain points in history, everything is at stake in political thought and action. She had long argued that any bargain with Mr. Putin was an illusion.She said 2008 was a turning point, the moment Mr. Putin divorced the West, even invaded another country, and the West barely noticed.“For Putin, it was a clear sign,” she said by telephone last month, “that he can do whatever he wants. And that’s exactly what he started doing. He behaved extremely rationally. He just realized that you don’t care.”She was referring to Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, which came shortly after President George W. Bush began to talk about NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine. I covered that war, and spent the night with a Russian unit in the Georgian town of Gori and remember how invigorated the soldiers seemed, laughing, joking. The Soviet defeat in the Cold War had left a bitter sense of humiliation and loss. The invasion seemed to have renewed them.“When Putin came, everything changed,” one officer told me. “We got some of our old strength back. People started to respect us again.”ImageA Russian soldier sitting on a tank in the Georgian town of Igoeti in 2008.Credit...Justyna Mielnikiewicz for The New York TimesMs. Albats sounded tired but determined. The day we talked, she had traveled to a Russian penal colony to be present for the sentencing of her friend Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s popular opposition leader, who used his allotted time to give a speech against the war.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.“We now understand that when Putin decided to go into war in Ukraine, he had to get rid of Navalny,” she said, because he is the only one with the courage to resist.Indeed, Mr. Navalny never accepted the turn away from direct confrontation and was building a nationwide opposition movement, leading people into the streets. He rejected the bargain and was willing to go to prison to defy it.Ms. Arkhipova pointed out that his mantra, that the fight was not of good against evil but of good against neutral, was a direct challenge to the political passivity that Mr. Putin was demanding.Many people I interviewed said the poisoning of Mr. Navalny in 2020 and the jailing of him in early 2021, after years of freedom, marked the end of the social contract and the beginning of Mr. Putin’s war. Like Al Qaeda’s killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud on the eve of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Putin had to clear the field of opponents.Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, argues it was the political opposition’s success, which began to accelerate in 2018 and 2019, that tipped Mr. Putin toward war.Professor Yudin said it was inconceivable to Mr. Putin that there could be people inside Russia who wanted the best for their country, yet were against him. So he looked for traitors and nursed an obsession with the idea that the West was after him.“It’s a feature of this kind of regime,” Professor Yudin said. “It recodes internal dissent into external threats.”As for my 2015 question — how long can a place be unfree and also happy — perhaps we have lived into the answer. Many liberals have left. Many of those who have not left face fines or even jail. In the weeks after the invasion, the police detained more than 15,000 people nationwide, according to OVD-Info, a human rights group, substantially higher than in the protests in 2012, when about 5,000 people were detained over 12 months, said Ms. Arkhipova, who studied that movement. Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Ms. Albats has stayed and is angry at Russian liberals who have not.The message, she said, is that “Russian liberals, they don’t have any tolerance for any problems.” She added, “They just run away.”ImageRussians who fled the country gathered last month in Istanbul.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesAt the same time, she said, it’s an extremely hard choice. “Choosing between jail and not jail, I’d rather choose not jail,” Ms. Albats said, adding that she already faces thousands of dollars in fines just for reporting about the war.Mr. Yudin said the choice was hard because the crackdown was complete, and because political opposition was now being pulverized.“The best comparison is Germany in 1939,” he said. “What kind of democratic movement would you expect there? This is the same. People are basically right now trying to save their lives.”Not everyone, of course. Lev Gudkov, a sociologist at Levada Center, a research group that tracks Russian public opinion, told me that about two-thirds of people nationwide approve of Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine.“It is a less-educated, older part of the population, mainly living in rural areas or in small and medium-sized cities, where the population is poorer and more dependent on power,” he said, referring to those who rely on public funds like pensions and state jobs. “They also receive their whole construction of reality exclusively from television.”He points out that “if you look at 20 years of our research since Putin came to power, then the peaks of support for Putin and his popularity have always coincided with military campaigns.”One such campaign was the war in Chechnya, a particularly brutal subduing of a population that in 1999 was Mr. Putin’s signature act before being elected president the first time. We are starting to see some of the features of that war in Ukraine: bodies with hands bound, mass graves, tales of torture. In Chechnya, the result was the systematic elimination of anyone connected to the fight against Russia. It is too soon to say whether that was the intent in Bucha.ImageResidents of Bucha walking past the body of a civilian left in the street there last week.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesNow the bargain is broken, the illusion has shattered. And the country has been pitched into a new phase. But what is it? Mr. Yudin argues that Russia is moving out of authoritarianism — where political passivity and civic disengagement are key features — into totalitarianism, which relies on mass mobilization, terror and homogeneity of beliefs. He believes Mr. Putin is on the brink, but may hesitate to make the shift.“In a totalitarian system, you have to release free energy to start terror,” he said. Mr. Putin, he said, “is a control freak, used to micromanagement.”However, if the Russian state starts to fail, either through a collapse of Russia’s economy or a complete military defeat in Ukraine, “unleashing terror will be the only way for him to save himself.”Which is why the current situation is so dangerous, for Ukraine and for people in Russia opposed Mr. Putin.“Putin is so convinced that he cannot afford to lose, that he will escalate,” Professor Yudin said. “He has staked everything on it.”Audio produced by Jack D’Isidoro.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/putin-ukraine-russia.html

84,"The farmer was working in his field on a recent morning when a neighbor called to tell him that his warehouses had been shelled. He rushed back and found them on fire and one of his workers lying on the ground with shrapnel lodged in his head.“In one word, it was destruction,” said the farmer, Yuriy Gumanenko, 48. “Everything was destroyed into pieces.”The farmworker, 62, was hospitalized and had little chance of surviving, Mr. Gumanenko said. Three of Mr. Gumanenko’s four tractors were destroyed, and so were the roofs of his warehouses. The wheat he was hoping to sell and many of his seeds were lost.“All my life went to growing my farm,” he said, adding, “Now it’s all gone.”In the past six weeks, Russian shells have destroyed Ukrainian cities, homes, hospitals and schools. But the war has also reached deep into the fertile plains of a region known as Europe’s breadbasket, paralyzing harvests, destroying granaries and crops, and bringing potentially devastating consequences to a country that produces a large share of the world’s grain.Ukraine has already lost at least $1.5 billion in grain exports since the war began, the country’s deputy agriculture minister said recently. And the economic fallout from the war has also disrupted supplies from Russia, the world’s leading grain exporter.ImageA warehouse on Yuriy Gumanenko’s farm near Dnipro, Ukraine, after it was shelled last month.Credit...Yuriy GumanenkoThe combination is creating a global food crisis “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II,” the chief of the United Nations World Food Program has warned.In Ukraine, warehouses are filled with grain that cannot be exported. Russia has blocked access to the Black Sea, Ukraine’s main export route, cargo trains face logistical hurdles, and trucking is stymied because most truck drivers are men aged 18 to 60 who are not allowed to leave the country and cannot drive agricultural exports across the border.Ukraine has also banned some grain exports to ensure that it has enough food to feed its people.On Tuesday, the Agriculture Ministry said that six large granaries had been destroyed by Russian shelling. Farmers say they face shortages of fuel and fertilizer, and that some of their workers have gone to the battlefield.Some farmers have been pushed off their lands by the fighting, with shells and rockets destroying their machines, wounding their workers and killing their cattle.“My farm has turned to ruins,” said Grigoriy Tkachenko, a farmer in the village of Lukashivka, near the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. “There is almost nothing left.”His farm was shelled on a recent evening at milking time, he said. A rocket struck the milking hall, and the workers ran to another building for shelter. When the attack ended, Mr. Tkachenko’s farm had been reduced to rubble and scores of cows and small lambs lay dead.ImageA farmer harrowing a field near Kyiv, Ukraine, last month, before the start of the sowing season.Credit...Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA, via ShutterstockThe farm — his cattle, warehouses and machinery — was the product of his life’s work. After working in collective farms when Ukraine was under Soviet rule, Mr. Tkachenko bought about 15 acres of land and seven cows in 2005. Over the years, he expanded his operation to 3,700 acres and 170 cows, also producing corn, wheat, sunflowers and potatoes.“What we built over decades,” he said, “they destroyed it over just a few days.”Farmland covers 70 percent of the country and agricultural products were Ukraine’s top export, making up nearly 10 percent of its gross domestic product. Ukraine was one of the world’s main exporters of corn and wheat and the biggest exporter of sunflower oil.The country now has 13 million tons of соrn and 3.8 million tons of wheat that it cannot export using its usual routes, primarily by sea, the deputy agriculture minister, Taras Vysotsky, said last week. One farmer in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine said that he had 1,500 tons of grain and 1,000 tons of corn sitting in storage on his farm.About 400 miles northwest, near Chernihiv, Ivan Yakub fled his farm after the area was occupied by Russia, leaving 100 tons of corn and wheat in his warehouse.Farming has become impossible in several areas where there is heavy fighting or Russian occupation.ImageThe port of Mykolaiv on the Black Sea in February. Nearly all of Ukraine’s exports pass through the ports, which are completely blocked.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesFarmers also worry whether they will be able to sow crops this spring, putting next season’s crops at risk. On Thursday, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denis Shmygal, said that the government expected a 20 percent decrease in crops to be sown this spring.Russian forces have mined some farmland, blown up machines and destroyed fuel reserves, an effort, Ukrainian authorities say, to disrupt planting.“I don’t know if I will sow,” said Oleksandr Kyrychyshyn, a farmer in the village of Blahodativka, in the Kherson region. “They told us that every car that drives out into the field will be shot.”Mr. Yakub, who fled his farm near Chernihiv, still wakes up at 6 a.m. out of habit. He makes tea, but cannot reach his tractor and fertilize his land to prepare for sowing sunflower seeds. His fields, under Russian occupation, remain fallow.“I paid for the seeds but I can’t put them in the ground,” he said. “I’m just a farmer, I want to grow what people need.”In less affected areas farmers have started to sow, but many lack fuel, fertilizer and seeds because ports have been blocked and imports from Russia and Belarus halted. A government survey last month found that farmers had 20 percent of the fuel needed for the spring sowing.ImageVolunteers distributed food to the elderly and needy last month in Kyiv.

He said that he probably would not be able to find soy seeds, but that his friends would give him other kinds.“They can shoot at us, but we’re going to keep working,” he said, adding, “I don’t know any other life.

85,"The mother’s hands were shaking when she started writing on her 2-year-old’s body. They trembled so much that she couldn’t write correctly on her first try, even though the information was second nature: Her daughter’s name, Vira, along with her birth date and their family phone numbers.“I thought that if my husband and I died, Vira could find who she is,” the mother, Oleksandra Makoviy, recalled.For Vira, standing in a diaper in their house in Kyiv, the writing on her back was a game. She didn’t know that the bombing had begun.Ms. Makoviy’s desperate attempt to prepare her daughter for the possibility of being orphaned as the family attempted to escape the Ukrainian capital during the Russian invasion has become a wrenching symbol of the anguish of a nation of parents.A photo of Vira’s back that Ms. Makoviy shared on Instagram has been seen hundreds of thousands of times, after it was amplified by Ukrainian journalists and government officials. Messages of support poured in from people all over the world — many Ukrainian parents said they had taken similar action, and others turned the image into art honoring the country’s innocent on social media.President Volodymyr Zelensky made a direct reference to efforts like Ms. Makoviy’s in a speech to the Spanish Parliament last week.“Just imagine this: mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children,” he said, adding that Russia was destroying “any basis of normal life.”The photo’s wide reach has led some people, particularly on Twitter, to accuse Ms. Makoviy of staging the moment. But she said she shared the photo because she wanted her small audience at the time to feel the “madness” Ukrainian parents were enduring.The start of Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 left Ms. Makoviy in shock. She described going about the family’s daily routine in a dream-like state, and recalled trying to play with Vira with the sound of bombs in the distance.But Ms. Makoviy, a 33-year-old painter who was born and raised in Kyiv, was also aware that the man-made island they lived on along the Dnipro River had no underground shelter, she said. Visions of the horrors that Russian forces unleashed on the Syrian city of Aleppo flashed in her mind.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Vira’s age and inability to understand the situation were a blessing, Ms. Makoviy said. The child inherited a love of art — she liked to draw on her own body — and had no idea of the gravity of what her mother inscribed on her.Still, Ms. Makoviy was brought to tears on the drive west by her daughter’s repeated pleas to go home and to see her grandmother, who had given her the teddy bear they brought along and didn’t escape Ukraine until later.Ms. Makoviy, who could not sleep or keep food down until they crossed the border into Moldova, did not want to lie. “We can’t go home now,” she told her daughter.The family eventually arrived in a village in the south of France, where they have found refuge. Speaking by phone, Ms. Makoviy said she thought that if the worst had happened, Vira might at least be able to look back at her mother’s Instagram, full of everyday moments from their life before the war, and see that she had been surrounded with love.After their journey, Vira has physical reminders of that love as well — several volunteers on their route gifted her teddy bears.

86,"Two days after a Russian missile strike hit a train station in eastern Ukraine’s city of Kramatorsk, killing more than 50 people, volunteer drivers across the Donetsk region are coming forward to help residents still looking to flee before an anticipated onslaught from Russian forces.“We don’t have much time,” said Yuroslav Boyko, who is from Kramatorsk. He heads Everything Will Be Fine, a Ukrainian aid organization that has been working to evacuate people from Donetsk since the start of Russia’s invasion.As Russia continued to amass forces near eastern Ukraine over the weekend and struck residential areas there on Sunday, thousands of civilians fled eastern and southern Ukraine at the urging of local officials, who have warned people to escape while there is still time.“In my estimation, the Donetsk region could be encircled in three to four days,” Mr. Boyko said. “We need to make sure everyone who is looking to leave can get out.”Mr. Boyko, 40, says he lost one of his volunteers, Roman Sementsov, in the Kramatorsk attack. In a Facebook post on Friday he praised Mr. Sementsov for helping thousands of people find safety.Mr. Boyko says he believes that Russia intentionally targeted the station, since it had served as an evacuation hub since the start of the invasion. But the number of casualties could have been much worse, he added, noting that many trains had been canceled on the day of the attack due to railway damage from a Russian missile strike the night before.“It was a happy coincidence that they were not functioning properly,” he said. Two train stations are still operational in the Donetsk region — in the towns of Sloviansk and Pokrovsk — but residents have become wary of gathering in stations since the attack, he said.Since Friday, Mr. Boyko says he has been inundated with calls from people hoping to volunteer and help with evacuations. He estimated that he’d received close to 70 requests on Sunday alone from drivers who would be ready to start shuttling on Monday.“Every day the number is increasing,” he said. “These are ordinary people, coming from all over Ukraine, who just want to help.”The volunteer fleet consists of at least 400 vehicles — including city buses and private vans — operated by approximately 1,000 volunteer drivers, who fan out daily to towns and villages across Donetsk to retrieve passengers.“We are doing everything now to avoid mass casualties,” he said, noting that organizers have redrawn evacuation routes to keep big groups from gathering in open spaces.For security reasons, passengers must contact volunteers directly to book tickets and are not given pickup locations or instructions until two hours before departure. Local officials have also been instructed not to advertise bus routes or schedules on social media too far in advance of departures.“We could see another Mariupol here,” Mr. Boyko said, referring to the southern city that has been encircled and bombarded by Russian forces for weeks. “We are hoping that our armed forces can hold their positions but they are outnumbered.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/europe/volunteer-bus-drivers-refugees-ukraine.html
87,"The stream of antiwar letters to a St. Petersburg lawmaker has dried up. Some Russians who had criticized the Kremlin have turned into cheerleaders for the war. Those who publicly oppose it have found the word “traitor” scrawled on their apartment door.Five weeks into President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, there are signs that the Russian public’s initial shock has given way to a mix of support for their troops and anger at the West. On television, entertainment shows have been replaced by extra helpings of propaganda, resulting in an around-the-clock barrage of falsehoods about the “Nazis” who run Ukraine and American-funded Ukrainian bioweapons laboratories.Polls and interviews show that many Russians now accept Mr. Putin’s contention that their country is under siege from the West and had no choice but to attack. The war’s opponents are leaving the country or keeping quiet.“We are in a time machine, hurtling into the glorious past,” an opposition politician in the western Russian region of Kaliningrad, Solomon I. Ginzburg, said in a telephone interview. He portrayed it as a political and economic regression into Soviet times. “I would call it a devolution, or an involution.”The public’s endorsement of the war lacks the patriotic groundswell that greeted the annexation of Crimea in 2014. But polls released this week by Russia’s most respected independent pollster, Levada, showed Mr. Putin’s approval rating hitting 83 percent, up from 69 percent in January. Eighty-one percent said they supported the war, describing the need to protect Russian speakers as its primary justification.ImageMoscow police officers detained an anti-war protester in February. Protests have largely dried up in recent weeks.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesAnalysts cautioned that as the economic pain wrought by sanctions deepens in the coming months, the public mood could shift yet again. Some also argued that polls in wartime have limited significance, with many Russians fearful of voicing dissent, or even their true opinion, to a stranger at a time when new censorship laws are punishing any deviation from the Kremlin narrative with as much as 15 years in prison.But even accounting for that effect, Denis Volkov, Levada’s director, said his group’s surveys showed that many Russians had adopted the belief that a besieged Russia had to rally around its leader.Particularly effective in that regard, he said, was the steady drumbeat of Western sanctions, with airspace closures, visa restrictions and the departure of popular companies like McDonald’s and Ikea feeding the Kremlin line that the West is waging an economic war on the Russian people.“The confrontation with the West has consolidated people,” Mr. Volkov said.As a result, those who still oppose the war have retreated into a parallel reality of YouTube streams and Facebook posts increasingly removed from the broader Russian public. Facebook and Instagram are now inaccessible inside Russia without special software, and Russia’s most prominent independent outlets have all been forced to shut down.In the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, near the border with Ukraine, a local activist, Sergei Shalygin, said that two friends who had previously joined him in pro-democracy campaigns had drifted into the pro-war camp. They have taken to forwarding him Russian propaganda posts on the messaging app Telegram that claim to show atrocities committed by Ukrainian “fascists.”ImageCommuters reading news on their mobile devices in the Moscow subway on Saturday. Independent news has virtually disappeared.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times“There’s a dividing line being drawn, as in the civil war,” he said, referring to the aftermath of the Russian Revolution a century ago. “It was a war of brother against brother, and now something similar is happening — a war without blood this time, but a moral one, a very serious one.”Mr. Shalygin and other observers elsewhere in Russia pointed out in interviews that most supporters of the war did not appear to be especially enthusiastic. Back in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea in a quick and bloodless campaign, he recalled, every other car seemed to sport the orange-and-black St. George’s ribbon, a symbol of support for Mr. Putin’s aggressive foreign policy. Now, while the government has tried to popularize the letter “Z” as an endorsement of the war, Mr. Shalygin said it’s rare to see a car sporting it; the symbol is mainly popping up on public transit and government-sponsored billboards. The “Z” first appeared painted on Russian military vehicles taking part in the Ukraine invasion.“Enthusiasm — I don’t see it,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a prominent Russian sociologist. “What I rather see is apathy.”Indeed, while the Levada poll found 81 percent of Russians supporting the war, it also found that 35 percent of Russians said they paid “practically no attention” to it — indicating that a significant number reflexively backed the war without having much interest in it. The Kremlin appears keen to keep it that way, continuing to insist that the conflict must be called a “special military operation” rather than a “war” or an “invasion.”ImageA concert in March marked the anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a move that was very popular among the public.

Last month, the channel launched a new program called “Antifake” dedicated to debunking Western “disinformation,” featuring a host best known for a show about funny animal videos.In a phone interview from the Siberian city of Ulan-Ude, Stanislav Brykov, a 34-year-old small business owner, said that while war was a bad thing, this one had been forced on Russia by the United States. As a result, he said, Russians had no choice but to unite around their armed forces.“It would be a shame for those servicemen protecting our interests to lose their lives for nothing,” Mr. Brykov said.He put a friend named Mikhail, 35, on the phone. Mikhail had criticized the government in the past, but now, he said, it was time to put disagreements aside.“While people are frowning at us everywhere outside our borders, at least for this period of time, we have to stick together,” Mikhail said.The war’s opponents are becoming targets of pervasive propaganda that depicts them as the enemy within. Mr. Putin set the tone in a speech on March 16, referring to pro-Western Russians as “scum and traitors” to be cleansed from society.ImageRussians who fled the country in Istanbul in March.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesIn the last two weeks, a dozen activists, journalists and opposition figures in Russia have arrived home to find the letter “Z” or the words “traitor” or “collaborator” on their doors.Aleksei Venediktov, the former editor in chief of Echo of Moscow, the liberal radio station forced to shut down in early March, said he found a severed pig’s head outside his door last week and a sticker that said “Jewish pig.” On Wednesday, Lucy Stein, a member of the protest group Pussy Riot who sits on a municipal council in Moscow, found a photo of herself taped to her apartment door with a message printed on it: “Don’t sell your homeland.”She said she suspected a secretive police unit was behind the attack, though Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, on Thursday said such incidents were “hooliganism.”Antiwar protests, which led to more than 15,000 arrests across the country in the first weeks of the war, have largely petered out. By some estimates, several hundred thousand Russians have fled amid outrage over the war and fear of conscription and closed borders; a trade organization said that at least 50,000 tech workers alone had left the country.In St. Petersburg, which had been the site of some of the biggest protests, Boris Vishnevsky, a local opposition lawmaker, said he had received about 100 letters asking him “to do everything” to stop the war in its first two weeks, and only one supporting it. But after Mr. Putin signed legislation effectively criminalizing dissent over the war, that stream of letters dried up.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin’s face and the letter Z at a shop in Belgrade, Serbia, last month.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times“These laws have been effective because they threaten people with prison terms,” he said. “If not for this, then the change in public opinion would be rather clear, and it wouldn’t be to the benefit of the government.”In a phone interview, a political analyst in Moscow, 45, described visiting police stations across the city in the last month after her teenage child’s repeated arrests at protests. Now, the teenager is receiving threats on social media, leading her to conclude that the authorities had passed along her child’s name to people who bully activists online.But she also found that the police officers she dealt with did not seem particularly aggressive, or enthusiastic about the war. Overall, she believed that most Russians were too scared to voice opposition, and were convinced that there was nothing they could do about it. She asked that her name not be published for fear of endangering her and her child.“This is the state of someone who feels like a particle in the ocean,” she said. “Someone else has decided everything for them.

But the peril they are facing now, with the Russian military massing just outside of town in a new and potentially more lethal phase of the war, could be far more devastating.Avdiivka is no longer simply a town on the front lines of the conflict with the separatists, absorbing the periodic volleys of a simmering eight-year war. It is now a significant impediment to Moscow’s military goals — squarely in the path of Russian forces aiming to advance and gain control in the east.The town’s hardened force of Ukrainian fighters is dug into an extensive World War I-style trench system, and will be difficult to dislodge without massive firepower. Whether Avdiivka and towns like it in the Donbas can repel the Russian forces will determine whether Moscow can claim a narrower victory after being soundly defeated in the north. But the Kremlin is intent on wresting the eastern territory known as the Donbas from Ukrainian control, and residents in Avdiivka and all along the so-called line of contact with separatist territory have begun to get a taste of what Russia’s military has in store.In Avdiivka, artillery shelling has intensified, bolstered by airstrikes that this week destroyed a supermarket and athletics store right in the middle of town, according to local officials. Dozens have been wounded in recent weeks, and each week brings a handful of civilian deaths.Already there are signs of a more costly engagement with the Russian forces. The lone surgeon at the local hospital, Dr. Mikhail Orlov, said the injuries he has had to treat in recent weeks are more serious than anything he has seen since the separatist fight began in 2014. He showed off a foot-long piece of metal shrapnel from a rocket that he said he removed from a woman’s back last month. She survived.“The wounds are much deeper, with trauma that involves chunks of muscle mass ripped away,” he said.ImageA piece of shrapnel that a doctor said was removed from a woman’s back last month.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesLife in town is miserable. There is no heat or running water and the electricity is spotty at best. As many as 2,000 people have taken up permanent residence in the city’s 60 bomb shelters, and many more have fled, said Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka’s military administration. But so far, the Russian forces have not yet broken through the Ukrainian defensive position, he said.“They can’t get through the front lines and so they’re starting simply to destroy the city,” Mr. Barabash said of the Russian forces.He likened the bombing of Avdiivka to the early days of the attack on Mariupol, the port city that Russian forces have turned into a charred ruin.The story is similar throughout the east. This week, Russia’s foreign minister announced that his country’s rocket and artillery forces had struck hundreds of military targets, the opening salvo in this phase of President Vladimir V. Putin’s war against Ukraine, which is about to enter its third month. From the northern city of Kharkiv to Mariupol in the south, Russian forces are arrayed along a front that stretches nearly 300 miles, preparing to try to seize a territory, the Donbas, that is about the size of New Hampshire.While fighting in the extreme northern and southern portions of the front has been intense for weeks, Russian forces have recently begun to probe points along the middle, including the cities of Izium and Kramatorsk, where a bombing this month at a central train station killed at least 50 people, and Avdiivka.Together, they make up a chain of cities fortified by the Ukrainians that stand in the way of Russia’s new military operation. For the Russians to conquer the Donbas, these cities must either capitulate or meet the fate of Mariupol, which will barely be habitable once the Russian military is through with it.On Wednesday, Avdiivka was nearly in full bloom, with pink flowering apple and cherry trees and tulips in just about every yard, though few people remain to enjoy it. Only about 6,000 of the city’s 30,000 pre-war residents remain, officials said, and the periodic boom of artillery and rocket fire throughout the day kept most people underground.Avdiivka once served as a bedroom community for the large metropolis of Donetsk, before that city was taken over in the separatist war instigated and fueled by Mr. Putin starting in 2014. Only 15 miles or so from Donetsk, Avdiivka has since been a frontline garrison city, with a contingent of Ukrainian forces dug into trenches built around the ruins of country homes and an old tire factory.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Much of the fighting was confined to this area, until Mr. Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. While Ukrainian forces still hold the line, the Russian attacks have escalated significantly; shelling since the start of the war has damaged some 800 homes, said Mr. Barabash.“They are constantly hitting apartment blocks,” he said.The central hospital in Avdiivka has been newly renovated, but it had no power on Wednesday and water for drinking is available only from a large blue cistern in the lobby. It is operating with a skeleton crew of 40 people. The medical director and Dr. Orlov, the surgeon, have been living on the premises for more than a month.“If I go home I may not be able to return,” said Dr. Orlov. “I may come under fire along the way.”His colleague, Vitaliy Sytnik, the medical director, said there would have been far more injuries had residents not adopted the habit of spending much of their time in basements.A dank storage space lit by a single candle is where Valentina Mutyeva, 72, has spent much of the last month, along with 10 other people, including her daughter and two grandsons. Though the younger people often travel up to the surface, where much of the cooking is done on a wood-fired stove in the courtyard, Ms. Mutyeva said she spends most of her days below ground.“You go up just for five minutes and they start to shell,” she said “And at night they shell.”While she said she laments the comforts of home, what really concerns her is the effect the war has had on the town's children. She pointed to one of her grandsons, Sasha, a slight blond boy of 15, who she said has been deeply scarred by the fighting that has raged for much of his life.“He started to walk around at night and talk to himself, because of this war,” she said through tears. “Children of the underground. It’s so brutal.”In another part of town, a rocket blast that rattled the walls of a basement housing about 30 people somehow didn’t faze a 6-year-old girl named Varvara, who sat drawing at a little table. When she was finished she showed a reporter a picture of a green alien she had drawn, with a vacant black eye that she said was for seeing the future. She happily announced that the alien had told her the reporter would live forever.“What about the war, when will it end?” she was asked.“That, he cannot see,” she said.ImageValeria, 3, between her parents, Iliya, 34, and Lena, 37, and her 6-year-old sister, Varvara, in the basement where they have been living in Avdiivka.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/world/europe/avdiivka-ukraine-russia.html
89,"LOS ANGELES — After Iryna Merezhko persuaded her sister in Ukraine that her young nephew should join her in Los Angeles to wait out the war, she traveled halfway around the globe to pick him up. “I told him it would be a California vacation,” she recalled. “We would go to Disneyland, Universal Studios, the beach.”The boy, Ivan Yereshov, 14, made it with her to Tijuana, Mexico, early this month, joining thousands of Ukrainians waiting at the border for permission to enter the United States.To be on the safe side, Ms. Merezhko carried a notarized power of attorney attesting that Ivan had been handed over into his aunt’s care. But an officer informed them that Ivan could not enter with his aunt — because she was not his parent. “They told us we would be separated for one or two days,” recalled Ms. Merezhko, who said she embraced Ivan as his initial enthusiasm dissolved into dismay.Ten days went by before she would learn his whereabouts.Dozens of Ukrainian children have been separated from relatives, friends or older siblings with whom they have traveled to the southern border under a law designed to prevent migrant children from being trafficked. In effect since 2008, the law requires U.S. border authorities to place “unaccompanied minors” in government shelters, where they must remain until their guardians have been screened and approved.The brunt of the law has been felt by Central American children, the largest group of minors to reach the border in recent years and who are often fleeing gang violence. But those children typically are aware of the policy and know that they will be taken into temporary custody. For Ukrainian children, the separation from their caretakers has been an unexpected, shocking twist in their escape from a war zone.The separations are different from those in 2018, when the Trump administration intentionally removed children from migrant parents to discourage border crossings; the punitive measure also resulted in children being sent to government shelters.ImageMs. Merezhko shows a photo of her nephew, Ivan Yereshov, 14, that she took while they were staying at the refugee camp for Ukrainians in Tijuana, Mexico.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times“Imagine — some of these children’s parents died or are fighting; they’re traumatized from the war and the journey,” said Erika Pinheiro, a lawyer with Al Otro Lado, a migrant support group that works with asylum seekers in Tijuana, a border city that is opposite San Diego. “Then they get separated from family, without understanding why, and sent to a shelter where staff don’t speak their language.”Ms. Pinheiro acknowledged that it was vital to protect children from potential traffickers, but she said that more careful screenings at the border could alleviate the need for traumatic separations. “There are people out there who don’t have the children’s best interest at heart,” she said. “There are also lots of extended family who should be legitimately processed.”U.S. authorities have not released figures on how many Ukrainian children have been separated from caregivers, but volunteers working with the refugees said they have counted at least 50. Up to 20 children have lately been arriving daily in Tijuana with someone other than a parent, they said. Often these children have a father who could not leave the country because men must support the war effort and a mother who could not travel. Their parents entrusted someone else to ferry them to the United States.The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the anti-trafficking law defines any child who is not with a parent or legal guardian as “unaccompanied,” and requires that the child be transferred to a government shelter for care and custody, and be screened for signs of human trafficking.“Any potential guardian must, by law, be vetted prior to reunification to protect against trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable children.”Migrant advocates concede there is a risk of children becoming vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation amid the chaos of war, but say U.S. authorities are enforcing the law inconsistently, sowing confusion and heartache. Sometimes a child traveling with an adult sibling has been removed to a shelter, but not always. Many children have been separated from aunts, grandparents or friends; others have been released to continue on with them.Last month, Molly Surazhsky of Brooklyn, the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants, escorted Liza Krasulia, 17, whose mother is a close family friend, from where she had escaped the war in Poland to the southern border.Ms. Surazhsky said she had consulted an immigration lawyer in New York who had said that she did not foresee any problems. They carried a notarized letter from the parent giving Ms. Surazhsky authority to care for Liza.But on March 30 at the border, officials told them that they would have to hold the girl for up to two days. “They said, ‘She will be treated better than we are,’” Ms. Surazhksy recalled.Liza was shocked and began to sob.“I told her, ‘Don’t worry. I’m not going anywhere without you.’”After checking into a hotel in San Diego, Ms. Surazhsky got a call from Liza, who by then was even more distraught. Officers had confiscated her phone, baggage, book — and shoelaces. She was sharing a cell at the border with 25 women and children from Ukraine, Russia and other countries, all trying to sleep on the floor with only flimsy foil blankets to cover them.ImageMolly Surazhsky, left, and Liza Krasulia in Mexico City.Credit... A few days passed before Ms. Surazhsky learned that Liza had been transferred to a migrant children’s shelter in the Bronx.She submitted 40 pages of paperwork and fingerprints, and waited for approval to officially sponsor her.On Monday, she was informed that Liza would be released from the shelter the following day, three weeks after they had crossed the border.“While I understand the necessity of vetting caretakers, there has to be a better way for the government to do this without inflicting more trauma on the children,” said Ms. Surazhsky, a textile artist. “They are making kids feel like prisoners.”Casey Revkin, a co-founder of the nonprofit Each Step Home, which helps migrant families navigate the reunification process, said that for years Central American children have been unnecessarily removed at the border from grandparents, adopted parents and siblings.“The government could send social workers to the border to verify the familial relationship and avoid the trauma of separating these children, who have gone through so much, from their caregivers,” Ms. Revkin said.Ms. Pinheiro pointed out that during the Afghan evacuation, the U.S. government issued a directive that instructed authorities to allow children to remain with “nonparental caregivers” with whom they had entered the country, rather than be transferred to shelters.The government shelters where the children are being taken are operated by a separate federal agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency said in a statement that its role was not to make “immigration determinations.”“Our job is to provide them with care and protection while they’re in our temporary custody,” the statement said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.In the case of Ms. Merezhko, who has lived in the United States since 2014, the family had made a decision to try to get Ivan to safety in Los Angeles as quickly as possible, without waiting for the United States to begin issuing permission for refugees to fly directly. Entering through Mexico, which does not require visas for Ukrainians, has been a stopgap measure for an estimated 5,000 Ukrainians since the war began in February.Ms. Merezhko spent about $7,000 to purchase airline tickets, took a leave from her job as a pharmacy technician and set out to retrieve the boy. They rendezvoused in western Ukraine, after he had managed to board an evacuation train out of the besieged city of Kharkiv, where the family lived.“I thought I was doing the right thing because it was the only way to save the child, to bring him to a safe place,” she said.From Madrid, they boarded a flight to Monterrey, Mexico, and connected on April 6 to Tijuana. They slept in a tent erected outside a gym that was already overflowing with Ukrainians waiting to report to the border checkpoint for processing.When it was their turn two days later, Ms. Merezhko said, Customs and Border Protection officers carefully studied the documents and notarized letter from Ivan’s mother stating that her sister had been granted full responsibility for him.ImageThe Merezhko family is still waiting to be reunited with Ivan. They have been told it could take 20 to 30 days for him to be released.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesAn officer told them that they would have to be separated — for just one or two days.“Everything will be OK,” Ms. Merezhko assured Ivan.The following day, her phone rang, and an officer put Ivan on the line. “Mama, Mama, is that you?” he asked, thinking it would be his mother in Ukraine.His aunt’s heart sank. In the 60-second exchange, all that he was allotted, the boy said he was still at the border. The officer told Ms. Merezhko to expect another call soon.Days went by, no call came and her anxiety mounted.Ms. Merezhko learned that Ivan was now probably at a government shelter, and she found the number of a hotline for families trying to locate children.An attendant confirmed that Ivan was in the system, and told his aunt that she would be contacted by a case manager in a few days.“I got no information about how he is, where he is,” Ms. Merezhkho recalled.Days passed.She called the hotline again, and an operator urged her to be patient: It could take 20 to 30 days before Ivan was released, she said, and that process had not even started.During an anguished call, Ms. Merezhko’s sister, Kateryna, told her that she now regretted sending away her only child. “At least we would know where he was if he had stayed with us,” she told her.Over the weekend, with the help of Ms. Revkin, from the nonprofit, Ms. Merezhko filled out 25 pages of forms to which she attached green cards, marriage certificates, birth certificates and pay stubs for her and her husband. Yet she had nowhere to send the file.Finally, on Monday, Ms. Merezhko’s husband, Vadym, got a call from Ivan, who said he was at a shelter in California. A case worker said they could send the documents. But there still was no word on when Ivan would be released.“Good news today,” Ms. Merezhko said. “But I am a little bit worried about how long it will be.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/us/ukraine-family-separations.html
90,"Right now Vladimir Putin is losing the battle for Ukraine. His maximal goals have been abandoned (for now); his troops around Kyiv are in retreat; his imperial dreams are being disavowed. He has more modest goals to fall back on, resources and territories that he may be able to hold — but a month of Ukrainian valor and Western support has dealt his ambitions a devastating blow.Putin is not losing, however, in the battle for Russia. From the start of hostilities, the Western answer to his maximalist ambitions — not an official goal, but a hope that informs policy and punditry and slips out of Joe Biden’s lips in excited moments — has been regime change in the Kremlin, a failed war toppling Putin and bringing a more reasonable government to power.This was always a thin hope, but despite military quagmire and unprecedented economic sanctions, it appears even thinner now. In polling and anecdote alike, Putin appears to be consolidating support from the Russian public, rallying a nation that feels itself to be as he portrays it — unjustly surrounded and besieged.His approval ratings, according to Russia’s main independent pollster, look like George W. Bush’s after 9/11. His inner circle has always been unlikely to break with him, for reasons sketched by Anatol Lieven in The Financial Times a few weeks ago: Its members mostly come from the same background, share the same geopolitical assumptions, and are far more likely “to fight on ruthlessly for a long time” than to suddenly turn against their leader. But even in the wider circle of Russian elites, the war so far has reportedly generated more anti-Western solidarity than division.“Putin’s dream of a consolidation among the Russian elite has come true,” the journalist Farida Rustamova reported from her recent conversations. “These people understand that their lives are now tied only to Russia, and that that’s where they’ll need to build them.”It is, of course, reasonable to question both anecdote and data from a system that punishes dissent. But these kinds of patterns should not be surprising. Yes, failed wars sometimes bring down authoritarian regimes — like the Argentine junta after its misadventure in the Falkland Islands. But externally imposed sanctions, economic warfare, often end up strengthening the internal power of the targeted regime. In the short run, they supply an external scapegoat, an obvious enemy to blame for hardship instead of your own leaders. In the long run, the academic literature suggests, they may make states more repressive, less likely to democratize.Just consider the list of bad-actor countries that the United States has used sanctions against for long periods of time. From Cuba to North Korea, Iran to Venezuela — not to mention Iraq before our 2003 invasion — the pattern is predictable: The people suffer, the regime endures.It should be our assumption — not a certainty, but a guiding premise — that the same will be true of a sanctioned and isolated Russia. Even if the rally to Putin fades as the economic pain increases, the forces empowered by Russian suffering will not be liberal ones. And any leadership change is more likely to resemble Nicolás Maduro succeeding Hugo Chávez than it is the revolutions of 1989.This assumption has two implications. The first is for the war itself: In the near term, whatever Ukraine regains, it will regain on the battlefield, not through some deus ex Moscow delivering a friendlier Russian government to the negotiating table. This does not imply the United States should suddenly escalate militarily, dancing closer to a nuclear conflict. But it does imply that sustaining support for the Ukrainian military is our most important policy, with sanctions playing only a supporting role.The second implication is for the long term, once peace in some form is established. Especially if that peace is a frozen conflict, in which Putin claims victory by holding onto some Ukrainian territory, there will be pressure to leave the sanctions in place, to continue the war indefinitely by other means.There will be an argument for doing exactly that, but we should be clear on the nature of the case: Namely, that even absent open war, Russia will remain a generational enemy to peace in Europe and a generational threat to American interests — making policies that diminish Russian wealth and power a justified form of self-defense, both for Europe’s eastern borders and for the wider Pax Americana.The argument will not be that sanctions are likely to deliver the Russian people from Putin’s rule, or that collective economic punishment is likely to be somehow worth it for the Russians themselves, come some hypothetical future revolution.No, if we intend to make economic war on Russia for a generation, we should be cleareyed about the calculus. In the hopes of making a dangerous great power as weak as possible, we will make it more likely that Putinism rules for decades, and that Russia remains our deadly enemy for as long as anyone can reasonably foresee.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

91,"BRUSSELS — The European Union on Friday called on China not to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine or to subvert Western sanctions on Moscow, in the first summit meeting between the two sides in two years.The summit, in separate sessions with Beijing’s leaders, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, came as tensions were high over Beijing’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, China’s record on human rights and its trade boycott of Lithuania for hosting a representative office of Taiwan.Europe-China relations have essentially been in a deep freeze since the E.U. imposed sanctions on China last year for its abuses against the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, and China answered by penalizing members of the European Parliament.Friday’s summit meeting produced no joint statement or any specific agreement, and there was no joint news conference. But China and the bloc are each other’s largest trade partners, and China is eager to preserve and enhance its trade with the bloc, but without upsetting its relations with Russia, a friendship it declared had “no limits” just days before the Ukraine invasion.With tensions high, the main effort of the meeting Friday was to try to manage the relationship with China, E.U. officials said. As expected, the Chinese leaders said that they favored an early peace in Ukraine, but did nothing to pull back from their alliance with Russia.ImageContainers at the Yangshan Deep Water Port in Shanghai.Credit...Aly Song/ReutersBoth sides agreed that “this war is threatening global security and the world’s economy,” said Charles Michel, president of the European Council, after the virtual summit.“Any attempts to circumvent sanctions or provide aid to Russia would prolong the war,” he said, leading “to more loss of life and greater economic impact.”Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president, said that the Europeans emphasized that “no European citizen would understand any support to Russia’s ability to wage war,” which “would lead to major reputational damage for China here in Europe.”But China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council committed to upholding international law, could do much good for itself by influencing Russia, its ally, to quickly end the war, she said.In normal times, Ms. von der Leyen noted, Chinese trade with the European Union is nearly 2 billion euros a day, while Chinese trade with Russia is about 330 million euros a day.There was little doubt, then, that for the Chinese leaders, economic relations were paramount. In a statement issued by Mr. Xi, he concentrated on mutual cooperation and urged Brussels “to form its own perception of China, adopt an independent China policy and work with China for the steady and sustained growth of China-E.U. relations.”ImagePresident Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission and President Charles Michel of the European Council following the online summit in Brussels on Friday.Credit...Olivier Hoslet/EPA, via ShutterstockChina has regularly tried to break the European Union’s close relations with the United States, which have only been reinforced because of the war in Ukraine. Mr. Xi mentioned the war in Ukraine only in passing, noting that it came on top of the coronavirus pandemic and slower global growth, while urging Brussels and Beijing to help stabilize “a turbulent world.”The statement issued after the session with Mr. Li, which came first and lasted two hours, twice as long as the session with Mr. Xi, was similarly bland.“China has been promoting talks for peace in its own way and will continue to work with the E.U. and the international community to play a constructive role for early easing of the situation, cessation of hostilities, prevention of a larger-scale humanitarian crisis, and the return of peace at an early date,” the statement said.But as it aligns itself with Russia, China has for the first time criticized the NATO alliance in terms copied from Moscow. Since then, Washington has publicly warned China not to provide any material or financial support to Russia’s war, including helping Russia to avoid Western sanctions.China has always been eager to divide European Union countries from the United States and even from one another, said Philippe Le Corre, a China expert and a senior fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and at the Carnegie Endowment.But with China’s positions on Ukraine, its “no limits” friendship with Russia, its attacks on NATO, its actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, its refusal to let the world investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and its moves against Lithuania, Mr. Le Corre said, “China has an increasingly bad image in Europe, too.”Consequently, he said, “this meeting seems to have been a dialogue of the deaf.” The Europeans tried to convince the Chinese not to interfere with sanctions against Russia, he said, “but that’s the best they can hope for.”ImageDestroyed vehicles in Irpin, Ukraine, on Thursday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesStill, China seems caught by the difficulties of Russia’s war and embarrassed by the destruction. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that China still supports Ukraine’s independence and would work with the international community to call for a cease-fire.The Latest on China: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach could have far-reaching effects and has revived concerns that the country is going back to a planned economy.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.A new security deal. The Solomon Islands signed a sweeping security agreement with China that could threaten the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The deal gives Beijing a foothold in an island chain that played a decisive role in World War II and could be used to block vital shipping lanes.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.But two days ago, on Wednesday, Mr. Wang hosted his Russian counterpart, Sergei V. Lavrov, and insisted that relations between China and Russia had withstood “the test of changes in the international situation” and that Beijing wants to take bilateral relations to “an even higher level.”He added, echoing China’s past language, that “China-Russia cooperation has no limits.”China is also unhappy with how closely Brussels has aligned itself with Washington over Ukraine. The state broadcaster CCTV wrote in an editorial on Tuesday that Europe, “which has been repeatedly stabbed in the back by the United States,” should not make the same mistakes and be “dragged into danger by the U.S.”The last summit meeting between the European Union and China was in June 2020. Then in December 2020, just before President Biden took office, the E.U. and China sides signed a Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, a deal that was much criticized by the European Parliament and by Washington.Later, after China responded to E.U. sanctions over its abuses in Xinjiang by sanctioning members of the European Parliament, the parliament refused to take up ratifying the agreement, which is now considered dead.ImageThe European Council president Charles Michel at the end of the summit.Credit...Olivier Matthys/Associated PressOne of those sanctioned, Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Green Party member who heads the European Parliament’s China delegation, noted the surprise to Moscow and Beijing of Western solidarity over Ukraine.The European Union, he said, must “underpin this strategic solidarity with democratic countries by making it clear to the Chinese leadership that any violation of the Western sanctions regime against Russia will have direct consequences.”Relations are hardly improved by China’s economic sanctions against tiny Lithuania, which last year dared to open a representative office of the Taiwan government, effectively an embassy, and allow it to use the word Taiwan, instead of Taipei, the capital, which China prefers.While the world considers Taiwan legally a part of China, Taiwan considers itself a separate, democratic nation and has also proved itself vital in producing sophisticated semiconductors, on which Europe depends.China has not only organized a boycott of trade with Lithuania, but has also attempted to block trade in any goods that use components made in Lithuania. The European Union has brought a case against China in the World Trade Organization, which may take years to resolve and has complicated relations with Beijing.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/world/europe/eu-europe-china-summit-ukraine-russia-trade.html
92,"Martin Griffiths, the top humanitarian chief at the United Nations, said he tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday as he was visiting the U.N. headquarters in New York from a recent trip to Afghanistan, Russia and Ukraine.Mr. Griffiths met on Monday with the U.N.’s secretary general, António Guterres, but everyone in the room was wearing masks and social distancing was observed, according to Stéphane Dujarric, the secretary general’s spokesman.Mr. Dujarric said all meetings with Mr. Guterres, who is 72, follow strict masking and distancing protocols, and members of his staff are routinely tested. However, the U.N. headquarters no longer enforces masking and testing to enter the building, Mr. Dujarric said.Mr. Griffiths appeared unmasked at a briefing with reporters on Monday and several reporters in attendance were also not masked. Journalists at the U.N.’s daily briefings are often asked to take off their masks when asking questions, a request that can potentially expose them to the virus if anyone in the room happens to have the virus but is asymptomatic.“I am following health guidance, cancelled travel, and isolating at home,” tweeted Mr. Griffiths. “I’m grateful to have had my vaccines already, an opportunity too many around the world have not had.”Mr. Griffiths was planning to travel to Turkey and to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss how the U.N. can support Turkey’s mediation efforts between Russia and Ukraine for a peace deal.The U.N. tried and failed to negotiate a humanitarian cease-fire in Ukraine, a temporary halt in fighting that would have allowed the evacuation of civilians from conflict areas and secure safe passage for aid convoys, Mr. Griffiths said. He said Russia had not responded to his proposals for either a humanitarian cease-fire or improvement on access for aid workers.The World Health Organization warned in early March that the war in Ukraine would increase the transmission of the coronavirus and the number of people at risk of severe disease because of mass displacement and strain on health care facilities.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/un-martin-griffith-covid.html
93,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia claimed victory in Mariupol on Thursday despite persistent fighting there, publicly calling off an assault on the final Ukrainian stronghold in the devastated city in a stark display of the Kremlin’s desire to present a success to the Russian public.Mr. Putin ordered his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, in a choreographed meeting shown on Russian television, not to storm the sprawling, fortress-like Azovstal steel mill complex where 2,000 Ukrainian fighters were said to be holed up, and instead to blockade the plant “so that a fly can’t get through.” That avoids, for now, a bloody battle in the strategic port city that would add to Russia’s mounting casualty toll and tie down troops who could be deployed to the broader battle for eastern Ukraine.“Of course, getting control of such an important center in the south as Mariupol is a success,” Mr. Putin was shown telling Mr. Shoigu, though the city is not yet fully under Russian control. “Congratulations.”Video{""@context"":""http://schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""@id"":""https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000008313529/ukraine-russia-mariupol-steel-plant.html"",""description"":""President Vladimir V.

Putin used a choreographed meeting with his defense minister to claim major progress in the war, saying that he ordered Russian troops to blockade a steel plant where Ukrainian fighters and civilians have taken refuge.CreditCredit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersThe fight for Mariupol carries enormous significance for both sides. It is the last pocket of serious resistance in the land bridge the Kremlin has created between territory it already holds in the Donbas region in the east and the Crimean Peninsula in the south. It is also home to much of Ukraine’s Azov Battalion, filled with far-right fighters who give a sheen of credibility to Mr. Putin’s false claim that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that he is “denazifying” the country.The battle for the city also illustrates both the brutality of the Russian invasion and its struggles — truths that have galvanized much of the world but that Moscow has worked hard to conceal from its own people. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a month, much of it lies in ruins, and satellite images show a growing mass grave on the city’s outskirts. Roughly three-quarters of the residents have fled and, according to Ukrainian officials, about 20,000 civilians there have been killed — yet it is still not fully conquered.Russia is shifting the focus of the war to gaining territory and wiping out Ukrainian forces in Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukraine since 2014. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Thursday in an intelligence assessment that the Kremlin is eager to make swift gains that it can trumpet on May 9, at the annual celebrations of victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.At the White House, President Biden said the fight for Donbas was “going to be more limited in terms of geography but not in terms of brutality,” compared to the early phase of the war. But, he added, Russia will “never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.”Mr. Biden announced another $800 million package of weapons for Ukraine, including dozens of heavy howitzers, 144,000 shells for them, and tactical drones, bringing total military aid this year to well above $3 billion. The weapons supplied by NATO nations are becoming increasingly heavy and sophisticated, reflecting an expected shift in the nature of combat as the war pivots to Donbas, but the president said some of the armaments will remain secret.ImagePresident Biden speaking about the war in Ukraine from the White House on Thursday.Credit...Kenny Holston for The New York Times“We won’t always be able to advertise everything that we, that our partners are doing,” Mr. Biden said. Referring to the U.S.-made antitank missile that Ukrainians have used to devastating effect, he added, “To modernize Teddy Roosevelt’s advice, sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin.”Mr. Biden also banned ships tied to Russia from U.S. ports, and announced $500 million in economic aid to the country, though President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine later told the World Bank that it needed up to $7 billion in support per month. The White House also detailed plans for accepting up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, saying that U.S. citizens can begin applying to sponsor the immigrants on Monday.The war in Ukraine took center stage in the French presidential campaign in a televised debate Wednesday night between President Emmanuel Macron and his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen, who has in the past praised Mr. Putin. She spoke against arming Ukraine and said Mr. Macron’s efforts to cut imports of Russian energy would hurt France economically. He replied, “you are, in fact, in Russia’s grip,” noting that Ms. Le Pen’s party had borrowed from a Kremlin-linked bank.The Kremlin worked quickly to portray the battle for Mariupol as a success. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, told reporters that there was now “an opportunity to start establishing a peaceful life” in Mariupol and start “returning the population to their homes.”Mr. Peskov described the Azovstal steel plant — an immense Soviet-era complex near the city center — as “a separate facility” with no impact on life elsewhere in the city. Ukrainian fighters have been hiding for weeks in the plant’s underground bunkers, along with about 1,000 civilians, amid rising concerns they lack food and water. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008310557"");

Areas of Russian advances indicate where Russian troops were seen.By Scott ReinhardRamzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of the southern Russian republic of Chechnya, said on Wednesday that his troops would soon help Russia capture the Azovstal plant in its entirety. In Thursday’s televised meeting, Mr. Shoigu told Mr. Putin that it would take three to four days to clear the plant.But Mr. Putin responded by calling the storming of the plant “impractical,” and added, “I order it to be canceled.”It was not clear what that would mean on the ground; shelling and rocket attacks on the steel mill complex continued on Thursday, Staff Sgt. Leonid Kuznetsov of the Ukrainian National Guard, one of the soldiers there, said via text message. He said that shortly before he heard about Mr. Putin’s public order, Russian troops had attempted to storm the plant, coming within about 20 meters of his hide-out. The Ukrainians, he said, were running out of ammunition.In directing Mr. Shoigu on a national broadcast, Mr. Putin, who made the decision to go to war, presented himself as a rational and humane leader. “This is the case when we must think — that is, we must always think, but even more so in this case — about preserving the life and health of our soldiers and officers,” he said. “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities.”Implicit in his statement was a potential credibility challenge for Mr. Putin, stemming from his unwillingness to admit setbacks and blunders in the war to his own people. The government and military have not acknowledged the deaths of Russian sailors on the missile cruiser Moskva, pride of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, which was sunk last week, but information about missing troops is increasingly circulating online.Coming after Russia’s decision last month to abandon its stalled campaign in the north of Ukraine, the sinking of the Moskva — Ukraine claims to have hit it with two missiles — and the morass in Mariupol, once a thriving industrial and shipping hub, underscore the systemic weaknesses bedeviling the Russian military.VideoOn Jan. 20, The New York Times captured drone video over the sprawling Azovstal Steel and Iron works complex in Mariupol, Ukraine. Now, it is a battered fortress for the last Ukrainian defenders.But costly as Mariupol has been for Russia, it is far costlier for Ukraine. Civilian casualties are high, though for now there are only rough estimates, and nearly all the vital infrastructure — including some of Ukraine’s biggest export-oriented enterprises — have been destroyed. Hospitals, theaters, schools and homes have been reduced to rubble.President Zelensky said on Thursday that he would trade Russian soldiers who had been taken prisoner for the civilians sheltered at Azovstal, but he said that Russia had not yet responded to the offer.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Agreements to evacuate civilians en masse or bring in vital aid have mostly been thwarted, and have sometimes turned deadly, largely because Russian units have halted or fired on aid convoys. But day by day, people have managed to escape, on their own or in small groups.On Thursday, a yellow bus carrying dozens of people from Mariupol arrived in the central Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, where passengers described weeks hiding in basements, cold and hungry, amid endless shelling. They escaped in a harrowing, all-night drive through Russian-held territory, past countless checkpoints manned by jumpy Russian soldiers.ImageUkrainian families arriving in Zaporizhzhia after fleeing from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol on Thursday.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York Times“In the city everything is destroyed, it’s terrifying,” said Matvei Popko, 10, who had fled with his mother, father and grandmother. “At any moment your home could get hit and collapse. For a little more than a month we lived in the basement.”Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of civilians, including a large number from the Mariupol area, to Russian territory, for use as propaganda fodder and a bargaining chip. Russia denies the charge, which is a potential war crime.The weeks of heavy fighting in Mariupol tied up a significant chunk of Russia’s combat power; at one point the battle was estimated by military analysts to include roughly 10 percent of all the Russian forces in Ukraine.On Thursday, a Russian video news report from the scene showed a convoy of armored vehicles moving out of Mariupol. Seymon Pegov, a pro-Kremlin reporter embedded with the Russian forces in the city, interviewed Timur Kurilkin, a commander of a separatist battalion from Donetsk, a city in separatist-held eastern Ukraine.“We are going home, to Donetsk,” said Mr. Kurilkin, walking past the vehicles. “Our next battle is tomorrow,” he said, without specifying where.In Mariupol, Russia is already seeking to establish authority over civilian life. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, promised high school seniors that they would receive diplomas certified by the separatist entity.On Wednesday, Andrei Turchak, a top official in Mr. Putin’s party, visited a school in Mariupol, which has already switched to Russian-language curriculum. In a video of his visit, posted to social media, he said, “Many textbooks have already been delivered and these deliveries will continue.”Anton Troianovski reported from Hamburg, Germany, Ivan Nechepurenko from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

94,"A Russian warship in the Black Sea was “seriously damaged” on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian military official and Russian state news agencies, though each claimed a different cause for the destruction.The head of Odesa’s military forces, Maxim Marchenko, said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had struck the ship with anti-ship Neptune missiles. He claimed it was the same vessel that was famously and obscenely told off by Ukrainian troops in February, saying it went “exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!”Hours later, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said that ammunition had exploded on the ship, a missile cruiser called the Moskva, as a result of “a fire,” according to the state news agency Tass. The agency reported that the crew had evacuated from the ship and that the cause of the fire was under investigation.Neither account could be independently confirmed. If Mr. Marchenko’s claims are correct, the damage to the warship would mark a notable military triumph for Ukraine — the formidable Moskva is the flagship vessel of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.The ship, which is more than 600 feet long, first entered service in the early 1980s with the Soviet Navy and carries 16 Vulkan missile launchers with a strike range of more than 400 miles, Russian news agencies have reported. It was deployed off the coast of Syria in 2015 to provide air defenses and patrolled the coast of Georgia during a conflict with Russia in 2008.Ukraine has repeatedly claimed to have destroyed Russian warships since the start of the war, but its reports have not always been independently verified.In March, Ukraine’s military said it had destroyed a Russian ship at the port of Berdiansk, under Russian occupation in southern Ukraine, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was on fire at the port.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/russian-warship-black-sea.html
95,"Ukraine’s contender for the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest, the wildly popular, over-the-top annual European event that is a swirl of flamboyance and nationalism, is set to give its first international performance Thursday evening in the lead-up to the main event in May.The six members of the band Kalush Orchestra, a group that mixes rap and traditional Ukrainian music, were given special permission to leave the country despite a martial law that bars men of military age from departing, according to the country’s public broadcaster.“We want to show the world community Ukrainian music, our spirit and how unbreakable we are. We really need support in this difficult time,” the band said, according to the broadcaster Suspline, which runs the contest to pick Ukraine’s representative.Even though contest rules expressly bar political speech, gestures or lyrics, Russia’s war in Ukraine is very much becoming a factor in the shindig that last year was viewed by 183 million people worldwide. In February, a day after Russia sent its troops into Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union barred Russia from this year’s competition, saying it would sully an event designed to promote European unity and cultural exchange.Ukraine’s initial top pick for the contest, Alina Pash, withdrew from the competition before the war in mid-February, after a controversy over a 2015 trip she made to Russian-occupied Crimea.Kalush Orchestra performed their Eurovision entry, “Stefania,” Saturday at a town square in Lviv in western Ukraine for the first time since the war. The band’s frontman has said in interviews that he has been volunteering in war relief efforts, and one of his bandmates has served in a territorial defense unit.The group arrived in Israel this week to perform at a pre-Eurovision concert in Tel Aviv. They separately announced plans for a promotional tour ahead of the main Eurovision event to raise funds for Ukraine.Oddsmakers are predicting that Ukraine will win the final in Turin, Italy, which is decided by votes from the public and a jury. Ukraine last won with the singer Jamala’s 2016 song “1944,” which references Soviet abuses in Crimea under Stalin, just two years after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia annexed Crimea.In the 2009 contest, Georgia’s entry was a disco number titled “We Don’t Wanna Put In.” Organizers rejected that song as being overtly political for its less-than-subtle reference to Mr. Putin after Russia’s war with Georgia the previous year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-eurovision.html
96,"LONDON — A toddler cries on his mother’s lap while his twin naps a few feet away. The mother hushes their older siblings, who are watching videos on an iPad in the next room.The mother, Seema Mohammed; her husband, Eid Mohammed; and their five children have lived in two adjoining hotel rooms south of London since November after they fled Afghanistan. It is a cramped and claustrophobic existence that feels like limbo while they await permanent housing. But a reminder of what they left behind is only a video call away: Mr. Mohammed’s elder brother, a doctor and former police officer, is in hiding back home and desperately looking for a way out.“It’s a struggle,” Mr. Mohammed said. “Living a life is different than staying alive.” He was referring to the family he left in Afghanistan, but the same sentiment could apply to his current situation.Britain evacuated about 16,000 people from Afghanistan last year, most of them during the chaotic final days of August as the Taliban suddenly seized control of the country. Most of them have been living temporarily in hotels across Britain ever since, a situation that British lawmakers have said is increasingly untenable.ImageMr. Mohammed, who worked as a translator for British and American forces, had to flee with his family from Afghanistan last year when the Taliban took over the country.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesIn February, the government said that just 4,000 Afghans brought to Britain during the mass evacuation had been moved into homes — leaving 12,000 still housed temporarily in hotels.With a new and even larger refugee crisis exploding much closer to home now, officials are talking about taking in tens of thousands more refugees from the war in Ukraine. But the experience of Afghans has raised questions about whether the country can cope with much larger numbers when it has still not managed to settle thousands of Afghans many months after they arrived.The government has offered a number of reasons for the inability to find permanent homes for the Afghan evacuees, key among them a shortage of affordable housing across the country. But critics of the government say the situation is also a result of inept planning, a lack of will and even a hostility toward asylum seekers and migrants in general.“There is a xenophobic attitude underpinning immigration and asylum policy in the U.K.,” said Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights program director for Amnesty U.K.This criticism has been echoed with regards to the British government response to the refugee crisis created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has driven millions of people from their homes. Much of Europe has allowed the refugees to enter without visas, but Britain has required visas and an application process that is confusing many and slowing their arrival.When asked about the delays in housing Afghan evacuees, the government said that there was still no deadline to find permanent housing for all of them, and that it was matching people with accommodation as quickly as possible.ImageVolunteers bringing aid to a church in London, where it will be distributed to refugees.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesMost of those evacuated had worked in Afghanistan for the British military or government and fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, traumatized by their experiences.Large families are now crowded into small rooms where they cannot cook their own food, and they do not know where or when they will be given a permanent home. Many said they felt eager but unable to restart their lives.Despite the difficult circumstances, most Afghan refugees in Britain say they are deeply grateful for the chance at a safe future, with stable housing, ample food and access to medical care.Still, Becky Brook, a volunteer with Kensington and Chelsea Mutual Aid, a community group supporting refugees in West London, said the situation was not sustainable. Families are increasingly desperate to move on, among other reasons, because it is difficult for them to find work if they do not know where they will be living.“Being in hotels long term is not healthy for anybody,” she said.For Khalil Motawakel, 37, who was evacuated from Afghanistan in August, having a permanent home near London, where he has managed to find a job, would mean independence and security. As a former government minister, he was once responsible for overhauling Afghanistan’s troubled prison system.ImageKhalil Motawakel, an Afghan refugee, is eager for permanence in London. “You’d like to take some kind of ownership over your life,” he said. “It’s about the freedom of choice.”Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesWhen it became clear that the Taliban were going to retake the country and free its supporters from prison, he knew he would be a target.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.“Our lives were under deadly threat,” he said.Mr. Motawakel, who earned a graduate degree in public policy at the University of Bristol in England, said he had dedicated his entire adult life to strengthening democratic systems in Afghanistan and never thought he would be forced to leave.When he arrived in England in August, he was keen to immediately restart his life, and by November, he had found a job at an international public relations firm. Now, he commutes a few days a week to an office in London from his temporary home in a hotel an hour north of the city, where he lives with his wife and small child.While they have all of the essentials, and he is grateful for the support, he is eager for permanence.“You’d like to take some kind of ownership over your life,” he said. “It’s about the freedom of choice.”ImageAbdul Sultani, his wife and their three young children were resettled in a small house in North London in November. Some Afghan refugees have been lucky to secure permanent housing.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesOrganizations that support refugees say the government system for absorbing migrants is flawed and underfunded. The Local Government Association, which represents local councils tasked with ensuring that the needs of Afghan families are met, has asked the government for better funding and coordination.Last month, the government asked private landlords to register available properties on a relaunched housing portal. But the government’s reluctance to pay market value for properties leaves limited options, said Leyla Williams, the deputy director of West London Welcome, a charity aiding refugees and asylum seekers.She said the government’s failure to secure long-term housing was a problem for other asylum seekers long before Afghan refugees arrived last year. Some 25,000 asylum seekers from different countries, in addition to the Afghan evacuees, are also housed in hotels, the government said in February.Charities and veterans have often stepped in to fill the gaps left by government programs.Matt Simmons, a veteran stationed in Afghanistan with the British Royal Air Force in the early 2000s, set up Ems4Afghans, a community aid group in southern England that provides support to the refugees still in hotels.ImageThe Sultani family at a food bank in Northeast London.

97,"Good evening. This is your Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, a weeknight guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict.Russia declared the start of a new phase of its assault on Ukraine, aimed at capturing all of the Donbas region in the east.President Biden spoke with U.S. allies about stepping up military assistance for Ukraine and increasing economic pressure on Russia.The International Monetary Fund said that global output was expected to slow this year to 3.6 percent from 6.1 percent in 2021.The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, called for a humanitarian pause of the war to mark Orthodox Easter on Sunday.Follow our live updates.ImageThe body of a victim of shelling lay in the street today in Kharkiv.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesRussia’s new strategyRussia declared today that its military campaign in eastern Ukraine was underway as it bombarded hundreds of targets across a sprawling 300-mile front, from Kharkiv in the north to Mariupol in the south.For this new phase of the war, which Moscow says is aimed at seizing the entire Donbas region, Russia is taking a different strategy from that of the first weeks of the war, our correspondents Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Michael Schwirtz write.Ukrainian and U.S. officials say Russia’s new campaign in the Donbas will be much more methodical than its previous operation, which involved tanks making rapid advances and helicopter assaults deep inside Ukraine. That approach resulted in heavy Russian casualties.Over recent days, Russia has increased artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian lines. These smaller attacks, known as “shaping operations” in military circles, are often precursors to larger troop movements or can serve as distractions from other fronts.Ukraine said that it had repulsed seven different Russian thrusts, destroying 10 tanks and 18 armored units in the battles. The claims could not be independently verified.In the past several days, Russia has sent 11 more battalion tactical groups into the Donbas, bringing the number there to around 75, according to Pentagon officials. Each group has roughly 1,000 troops. It also has tens of thousands more in reserve north of Ukraine that are being resupplied and readied to join the fight.“Compared to the first few weeks of the war, this next offensive is a lot less decisive than it may seem,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia. “No matter what happens in the Donbas, the costs are likely to be so high that the Russian military will be a spent force.”While Russia has not yet conducted any large offensives, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said today that Russian forces are laying the groundwork for action: They have shuttled more surface-to-air missile systems to the front and more artillery positions have appeared.So far, Russia’s new campaign in the Donbas appears to rely heavily on long-range weapons, such as howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems, as does Ukraine’s defense.JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @nytimes channel.ImageThe Azovstal steel plant where the last Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol and about 1,000 civilians have been holed up.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersA final stand in MariupolThe battle to take full control of the southern city of Mariupol appears to be entering its final stages: Russian commanders said today they were beginning their assault on the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city have holed up, joined by about 1,000 civilians.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.But the plant makes for a formidable fortress, an immense industrial complex of thick concrete, steel doors and underground warrens, Cora Engelbrecht and Andrew E.

Capturing Mariupol would allow Russia to complete a land bridge between the eastern Donbas region and Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014.What else we’re followingIn UkraineA Russian artillery strike in eastern Kharkiv killed at least three civilians, the latest attack on the city.Residents in Dnipro flocked to the train station to leave the central Ukrainian city, with most saying they were frightened that war could now reach their doorstep.Russian soldiers fired on a 13-year-old boy, killing him, the BBC reports. “The Russians gave us permission to leave,” his mother said. “They even waved us goodbye and wished us luck.

98,"HANOVER, Germany — On the evening of Dec. 9, 2005, 17 days after Gerhard Schröder left office as chancellor of Germany, he got a call on his cellphone. It was his friend President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Mr. Putin was pressing Mr. Schröder to accept an offer to lead the shareholder committee of Nord Stream, the Russian-controlled company in charge of building the first undersea gas pipeline directly connecting Russia and Germany.“Are you afraid to work for us?” Mr. Putin had joked. Mr. Schröder might well have been, given the appearance of possible impropriety — the pipeline he was now being asked to head had been agreed to in the final weeks of his chancellorship, with his strong support.He took the job anyway.Seventeen years later, the former chancellor, who recounted the events himself in a pair of rare interviews, remains as defiant as ever.“I don’t do mea culpa,” Mr. Schröder said, sitting in his sprawling light- and art-filled office in the center of his home city, Hanover, in northwestern Germany. “It’s not my thing.”With Mr. Putin now waging a brutal war in Ukraine, all of Germany is reconsidering the ties with Russia that — despite years of warnings from the United States and Eastern European allies — have left Germany deeply reliant on Russian gas, giving Mr. Putin coercive leverage over Europe while filling the Kremlin’s war chest.That dependency grew out of a German belief — embraced by a long succession of chancellors, industry leaders, journalists and the public — that a Russia bound in trade would have too much to risk in conflict with Europe, making Germany more secure while also profiting its economy.Mr. Schröder was far from alone in that conviction. But today he has become the most prominent face of that long era of miscalculation, not only because he expresses no regret, but because he has also profited handsomely from it, earning millions while promoting Russian energy interests.His close ties to Mr. Putin have made him a pariah in his own country, where many now criticize him for using his clout and connections over the past two decades to enrich himself at the expense of Germany.ImageResidents surveying the destruction after a Russian rocket attack last weekend in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“He took advantage of the reputation and influence of the chancellor’s office and offered himself up as an agent for Russian interests to get rich,” said Norbert Röttgen, a conservative lawmaker, former minister and longtime Russia hawk.In the interviews, Mr. Schröder, now 78, spoke with undiminished swagger, cracking jokes but arguing in essence that, well, if he got rich, then so did his country. When it came to Russian gas, everyone was on board, he pointed out, mocking his detractors over copious amounts of white wine.“They all went along with it for the last 30 years,” he said. “But suddenly everyone knows better.”Mr. Schröder scoffed at the notion of now distancing himself personally from Mr. Putin, 69, whom he considers a friend and sees regularly, most recently last month in an informal effort to help end the Ukraine war.Mr. Schröder refuses to resign from his board seats on Russian energy companies, despite calls to do so from across the political spectrum, not least from Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a fellow Social Democrat, who worked closely with Mr. Schröder when he was chancellor.Distancing himself now, Mr. Schröder said, would lose him the trust of the one man who can end the war: Mr. Putin. Even so, after all of his years of close relations with Mr. Putin, he walked away with nothing during his one brief interlude trying to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.It is hard by now — with Mr. Putin unrelenting more than two months into the Ukraine war — to avoid the impression that Mr. Schröder is useful to the Russian leader as a cat’s paw to further his own interest in hooking Germany on cheap Russian gas.Germany’s reliance on Russian gas surged to 55 percent before Russia’s attack on Ukraine began in February, from 39 percent in 2011, amounting to 200 million euros, or about $220 million, in energy payments every day to Russia.It has helped make Mr. Putin perhaps one of the world’s richest men, has buoyed his otherwise feeble economy, and has enabled and emboldened him to pursue his aggression in Ukraine.ImageGerhard Schröder and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia depicted at the East Side Gallery this month in Berlin. Mr. Schröder, a former German chancellor, scoffed at the notion of distancing himself from the Russian president amid the Ukraine war.Credit...Anne Barth/ReutersEven as Mr. Putin was massing troops on the Ukraine border last fall, Mr. Schröder visited the Russian leader in Sochi, one of Mr. Putin’s favorite retreats, across from the Black Sea coast that Russian forces are now trying to rip from Ukraine.A cellphone photograph that Mr. Schröder showed me from that visit shows the two men smiling at each other, Mr. Putin in red hockey gear and Mr. Schröder in a light blue shirt and blazer. Asked what they talked about, he told me, “Soccer.”Mr. Schröder distanced himself from the war, though not from Mr. Putin. I asked about the by-now notorious atrocities in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb. “That has to be investigated,” Mr. Schröder said, but added that he did not think those orders would have come from Mr. Putin, but from a lower authority.“I think this war was a mistake, and I’ve always said so,” Mr. Schröder said. “What we have to do now is to create peace as quickly as possible.”“I have always served German interests,” he added. “I do what I can do. At least one side trusts me.”That side is not the German side.Since Russia’s attack on Ukraine began, the entire staff of Mr. Schröder’s parliamentary office resigned in protest, including his chief of staff and speechwriter of 20 years, who had been with him since his days as chancellor.He relinquished his honorary citizenship in Hanover before his home city could strip it from him — something it last did, posthumously, to Adolf Hitler. When even the soccer club Borussia Dortmund, which Mr. Schröder has supported since he was 6, demanded a strong statement on Mr. Putin from him, Mr. Schröder canceled his membership.Calls for his expulsion are growing louder among Social Democrats, too.But Mr. Schröder is undaunted. He remains chairman of the shareholder committee of Nord Stream, reportedly earning about $270,000 a year, and served as head of the supervisory board of Nord Stream 2, which built a second pipeline connecting Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, until it was shuttered before the war.Three weeks before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, Gazprom — the Soviet energy ministry turned Russian state-controlled gas company, which owns 51 percent of Nord Stream and all of Nord Stream 2 — announced that Mr. Schröder would join its board, too. (Mr. Schröder would not say whether he would accept the nomination.)ImageNord Stream 2 pipelines outside Lubmin, Germany, on the Baltic Sea. Mr. Schröder served as chairman of that Russian-controlled company until it was shuttered before the invasion of Ukraine.Credit...Lena Mucha for The New York TimesSince 2017, he has also presided over the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft, earning another $600,000 a year, according to public records, on top of his monthly $9,000 government stipend as former chancellor.Mr. Schröder’s entanglement with the Russian president and Kremlin-controlled energy companies overshadows all he achieved in seven years as chancellor, from 1998 to 2005, a pivotal period of leadership when he was lauded for refusing to join the United States in the Iraq war; giving immigrants a regular path to citizenship; and putting in place far-reaching labor market overhauls that would pave the way for a decade of growth under his successor, Angela Merkel.That legacy has been permanently tainted.But even his fiercest critics acknowledge that Mr. Schröder’s close and lucrative dealings with Russia are also emblematic of his country’s decades-old approach of engagement with Russia. Lobbied aggressively by Germany’s export industry and cheered on by labor unions, successive chancellors, including Ms. Merkel, collectively engineered Germany’s dependency on Russian energy.“Schröder is the tip of the iceberg,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former ambassador to the United States and veteran diplomat. “But there is a whole iceberg below him.”The Long Shadow of OstpolitikMr. Schröder was born in 1944, a year before World War II ended, and never met his father, who fought for the Nazis and was killed on the eastern front when the future chancellor was only 6 months old. The horrors that the Nazis inflicted on the Soviet Union, where some 27 million people died, weighed heavily on his youth, he said.Mr. Schröder joined the Social Democrats when he was 19 and was studying law during the 1968 student rebellion that challenged the silence of their parents’ generation over Germany’s Nazi past.A year later, when Mr. Schröder was 25, Willy Brandt became postwar Germany’s first Social Democratic chancellor, ushering in a new policy of engagement with the Soviet Union that became known as Ostpolitik.The guiding rationale of Ostpolitik was “Wandel durch Handel,” or “change through trade,” and would become a defining pillar of successive Social Democratic-led administrations, including Mr. Schröder’s two decades later.ImageChancellor Willy Brandt, right, being welcomed by the Soviet Union’s prime minister, Aleksei N. Kosygin, in 1970 in Moscow.

Mr. Schröder’s two children were both adopted from Russia.“All of these things influenced my relationship with Russia very early on, and as chancellor, I actually tried to continue it that way,” he said.When it came to pipelines, Mr. Schröder was not the first. They were being built between Germany and Russia even during the Cold War. Under Brandt, Germany signed a major pipeline project with Moscow, in 1970.His successor, Helmut Schmidt, chancellor for the rest of the 1970s and the early 1980s, oversaw an expansion of the pipelines, including another big project known as the West Siberia Pipeline.While that pipeline was uncontroversial in Germany, it was not without critics abroad — namely, the United States. The Soviets had already invaded Afghanistan and would soon push the Polish government to quash anti-Communist protests and impose martial law.“Basically, since the 1960s, cooperation with the Soviet Union and later with Russia has been a constant,” Mr. Schröder said.ImageParts of a Soviet natural gas pipeline ready for transport in the 1980s.Credit...Horst Ossinger/picture alliance via Getty Images“They got the money and they delivered the gas,” Mr. Schröder said of the Russians. “Even in the toughest times of the Cold War, there were never any problems.”After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, cheap Russian energy was seen more than ever as an earned peace dividend.It was also Germany’s geostrategic North Star. For a country that had abandoned a military dimension to its foreign policy after World War II, economic interests were its security interests.Germany is energy-poor, and as its coal resources diminished in the late 1990s, it needed affordable fuel to power its export-oriented economy, one of the world’s top five. Once the Russian pipelines were established, they fed German industry with a steady supply of gas through long-term contracts that led Germany to stop looking for other providers.“This story, among other things — the early gas pipeline business with the Soviet Union, the attempt to find a compromise with the Soviet Union — was the basis for the Russians being able to say, ‘OK, with this Germany we can risk reunification,’” Mr. Schröder said.During his own time in office, from 1998 to 2005, Mr. Schröder shepherded through Germany’s next pipeline project, Nord Stream 1.But his pipeline differed from his predecessors’ in important ways. It bypassed Ukraine and Poland, for the first time connecting Russia and Germany directly under the Baltic Sea.And the Russian president he was dealing with was Vladimir V. Putin.The ChancellorDuring one of Mr. Schröder’s first visits with Mr. Putin in Moscow, the Russian president invited the chancellor to the sauna in his private residence outside Moscow and offered him a beer.Mr. Schröder said that when the sauna suddenly caught fire, Mr. Putin tried to hurry him out, but he insisted on finishing his beer first.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.The two leaders hit it off, and not just because of their legendary macho bravado.

It was the first personal meeting between them.Credit...Tim Brakemeier/picture alliance via Getty Images“That created a certain closeness,” Mr. Schröder said. “There was a feeling that you can rely on one another.”“The image that people have of Putin is only half the truth,” he said.In 2001, Mr. Putin addressed German lawmakers, the first Russian president to do so. Speaking in German, he described Russia as “a friendly European nation” whose goal was “stable peace on the continent” and got a standing ovation. Among those applauding that day was Ms. Merkel, Mr. Schröder’s successor.Mr. Schröder recalled the mood in those early years of the 21st century. “It felt like a new era: the European House from Vladivostok to Lisbon,” he said.Nord Stream 1 was a corporate project, initiated by Gazprom and a Finnish energy company before Mr. Schröder and Mr. Putin took office, and eventually comprised German, French and Dutch companies.The idea was to secure German and European gas supply at a time when quarrels between Russia and Ukraine over transit fees and Kyiv’s siphoning off of gas raised concerns about supply disruptions.ImageA section of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline during construction in the Baltic Sea in 2011.Credit...Timothy Fadek/Bloomberg“Industry eventually came and said we need more, possibly a lot more, gas,” Mr. Schröder recalled. “We don’t just need the pipeline because we need more gas. We also need the pipeline because of the difficulties with the pipeline in Ukraine.”“Why should we have objected as a government?” he added. “It never occurred to anyone that this could become a problem. It was just a way of procuring gas for Germans, for Germany’s heavy industry, and also for the chemical industry, with fewer problems and disruptions.”Mr. Schröder and Mr. Putin backed the project early on and set up working groups to discuss industry and security.One was the strategic working group that was presided by Klaus Mangold, a former senior executive of Daimler and then the head of the Ost-Ausschuss, a pro-Russia lobby group. Representatives of industry and key ministries from both countries met several times a year in Germany and Russia. Mr. Schröder and Mr. Putin periodically joined.On Sept. 8, 2005, 10 days before the election in which Mr. Schröder’s Social Democrats lost to Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, the Nord Stream 1 contract was signed by representatives of Gazprom, E.On and BASF.It was celebrated by industry and politicians across the spectrum. Mr. Putin had come for the occasion and attended the ceremony with Mr. Schröder.ImageElection posters featuring Mr. Schröder and Angela Merkel, who defeated him in 2005 to become Germany’s chancellor.Credit... Roland Weirauch/European Pressphoto Agency“Independently of whether he will retain his position or not,” Mr. Putin said at a joint news conference after the signing, “we will continue to have very good relations with the chancellor.”The LobbyistIn November 2005, two months after Mr. Schröder lost the election, a Gazprom executive asked to meet. At the airport hotel in Hanover, the executive offered him the position of chairman of the newly established company in charge of building Nord Stream 1.“It felt a little early,” Mr. Schröder recalled, as he recounted the meeting.He was tempted. On his 60th birthday, a year earlier, his biographer, Reinhard Urschel, had asked him what he wanted to do after leaving office. “Make money,” Mr. Schröder had replied.But it was more than that, Mr. Schröder said. “I had been chancellor. I couldn’t go back to being a lawyer dealing with rental contracts. I needed a project,” he said. “Something I knew how to do and where I could serve German interests.”When Mr. Putin called Mr. Schröder on his cellphone the night of Dec. 9, 2005, he accepted the offer.Many in Germany were appalled. No chancellor before him had taken a job in a company controlled by a foreign country, let alone one that had benefited from their support in office.But the pipeline project itself remained uncontroversial.“The next government continued with it seamlessly,” Mr. Schröder recalled. “Nobody in the first Merkel government said a word against it. No one!”Mr. Ischinger, who was Mr. Schröder’s ambassador to the United States and later ran the Munich Security Conference, concurred.“You can’t blame Schröder for Nord Stream 1,” Mr. Ischinger said. “Most German politicians, whether in government or in opposition, did not critically question this. No one asked whether we were laying the foundation for getting ourselves into an unhealthy dependence.”Ms. Merkel, through a spokesperson, declined to comment for this article.Nord Stream 1 took six years to plan and build. In 2011, Mr. Schröder attended both opening ceremonies — one on the Russian end, in Vyborg, along with Mr. Putin, Russia’s prime minister at the time, and the other on the German end, in Lubmin, on the Baltic Sea, along with Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin’s trusted ally, Dmitri A. Medvedev, Russia’s president at the time.ImageMr. Putin, Russia’s prime minister at the time, center, visiting the Portovaya gas compressor station in 2011 with Alexey B.

The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Once Nord Stream 1 was operational, Mr. Schröder set about lobbying for a second pipeline: Nord Stream 2. That was when “the real controversy” started, Mr. Ischinger said.Earlier in 2011, Ms. Merkel had stunned the world, including her own country, by announcing that Germany would be phasing out nuclear power after the disaster at the Japanese nuclear plant in Fukushima. Under pressure from German industry to identify alternative sources of energy, she was open to Nord Stream 2.“They said we need a transitional technology — we won’t be able to do it with renewables alone, at least not at a price that doesn’t get us into financial difficulties,” Mr. Schröder said. “The transition technology was gas.”But Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2014, and then his annexation of Crimea the following month, raised questions about the viability of Nord Stream 2, as the West put the first sanctions against Russia into place.As opposition to Nord Stream 2 intensified, so did Mr. Schröder’s lobbying.ImageSupporters of Moscow in Simferopol, Crimea, in 2014. Mr. Putin’s invasion and annexation of Crimea that year raised questions about the viability of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesHis main allies on Nord Stream 2 in the Merkel government, said Christoph Heusgen, Ms. Merkel’s chief foreign policy adviser until 2017, were the economics minister and vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, and the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, both Social Democrats like the former chancellor and both from his home state, Lower Saxony.Mr. Steinmeier, now Germany’s federal president, had worked for Mr. Schröder when he was governor of Lower Saxony in the 1990s and later moved with him to the chancellery. Mr. Gabriel was Mr. Schröder’s successor as governor in Lower Saxony.The revolving door of contacts worried some lawmakers enough to ask the government to disclose a list of meetings between politicians and representatives of Nord Stream 2.According to the resulting report, from January 2015 to October 2017, there were 62 such meetings, including 20 with Mr. Gabriel and 10 with Mr. Steinmeier or his ambassadors in Brussels and Moscow.Matthias Warnig, the chief executive of Nord Stream 2, who took part in 19 of the meetings in the report, has acknowledged having been a former spy of the Stasi, the former secret police of Communist East Germany. Stasi records show that, in February 1988, both he and Mr. Putin, when he was stationed in Dresden as a K.G.B. officer, were awarded medals for their service. But Mr. Warnig has denied reports that he had recruited spies for Mr. Putin in their old days.In February 2015, Mr. Schröder took Mr. Warnig to see Mr. Gabriel to discuss cooperation with Russia, according to the list of meetings provided in the report. He also accompanied Nord Stream 2 executives to see Mr. Steinmeier’s ambassadors to Moscow and Brussels at the time.Mr. Steinmeier declined to be interviewed for this article. Mr. Gabriel texted to say he only met “representatives of Russia and Gazprom between 2014 and 2016” to “avert a looming supply stop of Russia to Ukraine.”He added: “Should you put my visits and meetings in Russia in a different context, I want to inform you now that I will initiate legal steps.”ImagePresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany recently admitted mistakes in policy toward Russia in his previous role as foreign minister.Credit...Clemens Bilan/EPA, via ShutterstockOne big event included a 70th birthday party for Mr. Schröder hosted by Nord Stream at the majestic Yusupov Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia. Mr. Putin attended, as did Gazprom’s chief executive, Alexey B. Miller, and Mr. Warnig.Nord Stream 2 was approved in June 2015, the same year that Gazprom was also allowed under the Merkel government to buy Germany’s biggest strategic gas-storage facility, where it has kept levels of gas conspicuously low for the past year in what may have been preparation for providing leverage for Mr. Putin in his war.But Mr. Schröder said he was unbothered by the growing dependency, or by American and Eastern European warnings about Mr. Putin weaponizing energy supplies.The Russians, he argued, had always been reliable when it came to delivering oil and gas.“Why should we have been distrustful? It always worked,” Mr. Schröder said. “For us, dependency meant double dependency. The so-called energy weapon is ambiguous. They need oil and gas to pay for their budget. And we need oil and gas to heat and to keep the economy going.”The reasoning explains why Mr. Schröder says he promoted the deal last year — even in the middle of Russia’s troop buildup — for the Russian oil company Rosneft to buy up the majority share of the critical oil refinery in Schwedt, in northeastern Germany.ImageThe “Friendship” pipeline in Schwedt, which supplies 25 percent of Germany’s crude oil from Russia, according to the refinery. Rosneft is the largest Russian oil producer.Credit...Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty ImagesAlthough the strategic refinery went to a Russian company, Mr. Schröder argued that the deal was ultimately in Germany’s interest.“We made sure that Shell couldn’t sell to some unknown private equity,” he said. “They would have sold it off immediately.”“If the oil doesn’t flow anymore, Schwedt is finished,” he said, ‘‘with all the consequences that this has for northeast Germany, including Berlin.”The MediatorIn early March, just over a week into the war, Mr. Schröder said he was contacted via a Swiss media company, Ringier, by Ukrainian officials asking if he might be available to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv.Mr. Schröder said he sought reassurance from the Ukrainian officials that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine supported the initiative.The answer from Kyiv was swift but cautious. An opposition lawmaker, Rustem Umerov, was sent to see Mr. Schröder in Istanbul to lay out the Ukrainian demands. The two men met for two hours on March 7.Afterward, in the taxi to the airport, Mr. Schröder called a trusted contact at the Russian Embassy in Berlin to ask if Mr. Putin would see him. Ten minutes later, he had the green light, and on March 9, a Russian jet was sent to collect him in Istanbul.In Moscow, Mr. Schröder was treated like a head of state: The coronavirus quarantine requirement was waived in return for a Russian P.C.R. test, and he got to sit at Mr. Putin’s now famous 20-foot-long table. After meeting with Mr. Putin, a day later he also met with the president’s main negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, and Roman Abramovich, an oligarch who has served as an emissary between the Kremlin and Mr. Zelensky.“What I can tell you is that Putin is interested in ending the war,” Mr. Schröder said. “But that’s not so easy. There are a few points that need to be clarified.”He reported back to Mr. Umerov in Istanbul on March 13. Since then, there has been no further contact. Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin, declared the initiative to have “failed.”ImageFirefighters last month in western Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, after a Russian rocket attack on the city.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesMr. Schröder said he was ready to meet either side again.Even now, two months into the war, Mr. Schröder believes that whatever happens, Russian gas and oil will keep flowing. The government should not impose an energy embargo, he said.“My advice is to think about what an export-dependent economy can still cope with and what it can’t cope with anymore,” he said.What if Russia turns off the tap?“It won’t happen,” Mr. Schröder said. But if it did, “then I would resign.”The PariahWith the criticism of him mounting this year, it has gotten lonely for Mr. Schröder at home. He recently took up playing the piano. Outside his house, a police car is keeping watch day and night. Many of his old Social Democratic party friends have disavowed him.But if there is one place where Mr. Schröder still seems to be appreciated, it is Russia.ImageMr. Schröder at his home in Hanover, Germany.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York TimesMr. Putin spoke fondly of Mr. Schröder in February during a joint news conference with Mr. Scholz, the current German chancellor, who visited the Kremlin in a last-ditch effort to avert war.“Mr. Schröder is an honest man whom we respect and whose goal is first and foremost to promote the interests of his own country, the Federal Republic of Germany,” the Russian leader said.“Let German citizens open their purses, have a look inside and ask themselves whether they are ready to pay three to five times more for electricity, for gas and for heating,” Mr. Putin added. “If they are not, they should thank Mr. Schröder because this is his achievement, a result of his work.”On Russian state television, Mr. Schröder is frequently cited as a Western voice of reason, proof of the Kremlin’s contention that Europe’s current leaders have sold their countries’ interests out to a “Russophobic” United States.In January, Dmitri Kiselyov, the host of the marquee weekly news program on Russian state television, “Vesti Nedeli,” lauded Mr. Schröder as the last German chancellor before Europe “lost its own voice” in foreign affairs.“It was all downhill from there,” Mr. Kiselyov intoned.But to Mr. Putin’s critics, Mr. Schröder is the epitome of a craven class of Western politicians who enable Mr. Putin by financing and legitimizing the Kremlin.After Mr. Putin’s main domestic rival, Aleksei A. Navalny, was poisoned in 2020 in what the German government, among others, said appeared to be a state-sponsored assassination attempt, Mr. Schröder publicly played down the matter in the German news media.ImageAleksei A.

Last month, Mr. Navalny was sentenced to nine years in a penal colony after being found guilty by a Russian court of large-scale fraud and contempt. I pointed out that he had been poisoned. “Yes, but by whom?” Mr. Schröder replied.After he came out of a coma after being poisoned, Mr. Navalny told Bild, a German tabloid, that Mr. Schröder was “Putin’s errand boy who protects murderers.”Still, Mr. Schröder holds to his unwavering belief that peace and prosperity in Germany and Europe will always depend on dialogue with Russia.“You can’t isolate a country like Russia in the long run, neither politically nor economically,” he said. “German industry needs the raw materials that Russia has. It’s not just oil and gas, it’s also rare earths. And these are raw materials that cannot simply be substituted.”“When this war is over,” Mr. Schröder said, “we will have to go back to dealing with Russia. We always do.”ImageThe Kremlin in February.

99,"LVIV, Ukraine — When diplomats from Russia and Ukraine met for talks in the 19th-century Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on Tuesday, their host urged the antagonists to reach a cease-fire “to the benefit of everyone.”Those words from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may have resonated in particular with a Russian oligarch in the room, mysteriously watching from a front-row seat.The oligarch, Roman Abramovich, the 55-year-old owner of Britain’s storied Chelsea Football Club soccer team, is not a member of the Russian side of the talks. He has been sanctioned by the British government — but, curiously, not the United States — for ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who started the war.Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said that oligarchs like Mr. Abramovich should “hang their heads in shame.” Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, told the BBC that he had “no idea what Mr. Abramovich is claiming or doing” at the talks. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, would not specify what Mr. Abramovich was doing but said Moscow had “approved” his participation to coordinate between both sides.The unknowns of why he was in the room only added intrigue to the talks, which were reported to have made the first significant progress since the war began more than a month ago. And in a further hint of mystery, news emerged that Mr. Abramovich had been entangled in a bizarre episode, earlier this month, concerning whether he and members of the Ukrainian negotiating team were poisoned.The oligarch, who did not comment on why he was attending the talks, appeared to be trying to present himself to the world as an earnest and trusted conduit between Kyiv and Moscow. Critics of Mr. Abramovich suggested he was grandstanding for publicity, part of an effort to save his empire.Still, Mr. Abramovich has gotten close to a key member of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Rustem Umerov, according to a person familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are delicate. Mr. Umerov, this person said, believes that Mr. Abramovich wants to see the war stopped.By the time Mr. Abramovich had been sanctioned by the British government, he had been playing a quiet role in the peace process. He was acknowledged as part of a public round of negotiations in Belarus that began four days into the war. But now reports have emerged of Mr. Abramovich’s participation in a less publicized track, mediated by Turkey, which had him shuttling between Kyiv, Moscow and Istanbul.His role included personally delivering a handwritten letter by President Volodomyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressing an outline of his terms for an agreement to Mr. Putin, according to a report from The Sunday Times.Of all the rich businessmen around the Russian president, Mr. Abramovich, a Russian-Portuguese-Israeli multibillionaire, stands alone in his ability to combine both a reputation for high-level Kremlin connections and a celebrity profile — if not status and acceptance — in the capitals of the West.Mr. Abramovich started working in business in the late 1980s, buying and selling dolls, chocolates, cigarettes, and more. He began to amass his fortune in the mid-1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when he and a business partner persuaded the Russian government to sell them the state-run oil company Sibneft for about $200 million. In 2005, while he was serving as the governor of Russia’s resource-rich northeastern province of Chukotka, he sold his stake back to the government for $11.9 billion.As Mr. Putin brought businessmen to heel by jailing and intimidating them, Mr. Abramovich was among the billionaires who managed to remain on good terms with the Kremlin. He used his wealth to buy luxury properties in New York, London, Tel Aviv, St. Barts and Aspen, Colorado, as well as two superyachts, multiple Ferrari, Porsche and Aston Martin sports cars, and a private Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet — now grounded because of the sanctions on him.He has also extensively funded the Moscow art scene, including as co-founder of the Garage Center for Contemporary Art in Moscow, and played a role on the board of the famed Bolshoi Theater.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 24, 2022, 1:45 p.m. ETUkraine officials say U.N. should focus on humanitarian aid during trip this week, not negotiate in Moscow.Russian forces bombard Ukraine, ignoring calls for a cease-fire during the Orthodox Easter holiday.A mother had found ‘a new level of happiness’ when her daughter was born.

Negotiations went until 10 p.m. that night in Kyiv, and overnight the men began experiencing the symptoms, including impaired vision and peeling skin.As they drove from Kyiv to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv — en route, via Poland, to the next round of negotiations in Turkey — the team enlisted the help of Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, who had extensively researched the poisoning of the Russian opposition politician, Aleksei A. Navalny.The symptoms were severe enough that Mr. Abramovich asked the scientist examining him, “Are we dying?” one person who was present told The New York Times.The experts who examined the men said “the dosage and type of toxin used was likely insufficient to cause life-threatening damage, and most likely was intended to scare the victims as opposed to cause permanent damage,” according to a series of Twitter postings from Bellingcat. “The victims said they were not aware of who might have had an interest in an attack,” they said.Some Western officials sought to tamp down concerns over possible poisoning, suggesting that “environmental factors” were responsible.“The evidence is rather sketchy and in a difficult place,” one Western official said.Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Tuesday that the reports of poisoning were part of an “information war.”ImageMr. Abramovich invested heavily in Chelsea Football Club as the team’s owner.Credit...Martin Meissner/Associated PressBesides the British sanctions on him, Mr. Abramovich also has come under European Union and Canadian sanctions. Reports have emerged of Mr. Zelensky asking President Biden to refrain from sanctioning Mr. Abramovich because of the role he has been playing.“This is a combined operation — to help him and to help the Kremlin,” said Ksenia Svetlova, a Moscow-born Israeli political analyst, former lawmaker, and expert on the Russian Israeli community.“Moscow thinks they can use him,” she said, “and the West also thinks they can use him.”The fact that he is not part of Russia’s official delegation, she said, gave him more leeway to reach a compromise.“It’s the story of good cop, bad cop — there is the official delegation, and Abramovich has a little more freedom. He’s another arm of the Kremlin — not an official arm, but a softer one.”For Chelsea supporters, details of Mr. Abramovich’s role as an apparent intermediary has only led to further confusion about how the billionaire oligarch should be regarded. “The fact he’s trying to broker peace does put a slightly different slant on things than how they appeared to be two or three weeks ago,” said Tim Rolls, a member of the Chelsea Supporters Trust. “I think some think he’s been hard done by but it’s impossible to know what the situation is.”What is not in doubt is the admiration for Mr. Abramovich that many Chelsea fans still have for the man who invested heavily in their team and took it to new heights.“I think it’s impossible for a layman like me to know exactly how close he is to Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Rolls said. “For me and supporters it’s been tremendous. He’s taken us to the next level, to becoming one of the top six or top eight teams in Europe.”Tariq Panja and Mark Landler contributed reporting from London, Patrick Kingsley from Tel Aviv, and David D.

100,"A Ukrainian photojournalist who went missing over two weeks ago while documenting the Russian invasion of Ukraine near the capital, Kyiv, has been found dead, according to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general.The photojournalist, Maks Levin, 40, was a prominent freelancer who had spent years covering the conflict in Ukraine. There had been fears for his safety after he and a colleague went missing in mid-March while reporting near the front line of Russian fighting in the Vyshhorod area.His body was found in a village in the Vyshhorod district north of Kyiv on Friday, according to the Institute of Mass Information, a Ukrainian civil society organization focused on press freedom. He is survived by his wife, four sons and his parents.The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that based on preliminary information, Mr. Levin was shot by Russian armed forces with “small arms fire,” and that a criminal investigation into his death was underway.The colleague Mr. Levin had been traveling with, Oleksiy Chernyshov, has not been found, according to the Institute of Mass Information.Days before his disappearance, Mr. Levin had posted a series of harrowing images on his Facebook page showing the mass evacuation of residents, many of them draped in white cloth to signal their civilian status.“It’s like a horror movie,” he wrote in a message accompanying the post.As news of his death circulated on Saturday, there was an outpouring of grief from fellow journalists who had worked alongside Mr. Levin. Many had spent the last two weeks appealing for news of his whereabouts.According to the LB.ua, a Ukrainian news outlet where Mr. Levin worked for more than a decade, he was born in 1981 in the Kyiv region. He had extensively documented the conflict in Ukraine beginning in 2014, with his work published in several Ukrainian and international news outlets, and also worked on photo projects with a number of humanitarian organizations.Mr. Levin collaborated with Reuters, the BBC, and The Associated Press, among other news outlets.“Every Ukrainian photographer dreams of taking a photo that will stop the war,” Mr. Levin once explained, according to LB.ua.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/ukraine-photojournalist-maks-levin-dead.html

Ukrainian officials urged civilians to escape while there was still time.“Russia is preparing another offensive, hoping to break our national resistance after all,” Zelensky said in a video address to lawmakers in South Korea. “The occupiers concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and a huge amount of equipment to try to strike again.”The Pentagon confirmed that Russia is sending hundreds of military vehicles, including infantry and combat helicopter support units, and artillery to eastern Ukraine. New satellite images showed a long column of Russian military vehicles moving through the town of Velykyi Burluk toward the city of Izium, which could serve as the staging ground for the offensive.Following its retreat from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, Russia is focusing its military campaign on the eastern Donbas region, aiming to seize territory to create a land corridor to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.Zelensky said in a “60 Minutes” interview last night that the West should make the rapid delivery of weapons its “No. 1” priority to help Ukraine.“They have to supply weapons to Ukraine as if they were defending themselves and their own people. They need to understand this; if they don’t speed up, it will be very hard for us to hold on against this pressure,” he said.Senior U.S. military officials and some analysts have said this next phase of the war will be fought on terrain more favorable to Russia’s tanks and infantry units.Russia has also named a top battlefield commander: Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov, who oversaw Russian troops in Syria.President Vladimir Putin’s decision to appoint Dvornikov may indicate the future course of the war, Haaretz reported.

102,"WASHINGTON — Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday that they had thwarted a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid that could have knocked out power to two million people, raising fears that Moscow will increase its use of digital weapons in a country already pummeled by war.Ukraine’s power grid has been knocked offline twice before, in 2015 and 2016, causing widespread blackouts. Russia has long used online attacks alongside traditional warfare; just days before the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, Ukraine said a cyberattack hit its Defense Ministry, its army and two of its banks.But experts said the latest hacking — while unsuccessful — was among the most sophisticated cyberattacks they have seen in the war so far. It used a complex chain of malware, including some custom-built to control utility systems, suggesting that Russia had planned the attack over several weeks and intended to maximize the damage by sabotaging computer systems that would be needed to restore the electrical grid.The attack was scheduled to begin on the evening of April 8 as civilians returned home from work, Ukrainian officials said, and could have made it impossible for them to go about their daily lives or gain access to information about the war. The breach targeted several electrical substations in the country, and had it been successful, it would have deprived roughly two million people of electricity and made it difficult to restore power.In recent weeks, American officials have warned that Russia could try to expand its cyberwarfare — perhaps even by disrupting American pipelines and electric grids in retaliation for the sanctions that the United States has imposed on Moscow.Hackers affiliated with the G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence unit, were responsible for the attack, using malware similar to that deployed in the 2016 breach that plunged at least 100,000 people into darkness, Ukraine’s security and intelligence service said. That unusual malware can take over industrial control systems, essentially switching off the lights, and is rarely used. Cybersecurity researchers have not detected similar malware on computer systems outside the 2016 attack, which was attributed to the G.R.U.“This is yet more evidence of Russia’s capability,” said John Hultquist, a vice president for threat analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant. “The question is intent. Do they intend to do this outside of Ukraine?”The hackers customized a version of the 2016 malware for the attack last week on the Ukrainian electrical company and also deployed so-called wiper malware, which is designed to erase data, on its computer systems in an apparent attempt to make it more difficult for the utility to restore service after a blackout began.“Trying to cut the power is definitely something very significant,” said Jean-Ian Boutin, the director of threat research at the cybersecurity firm ESET, which helped Ukraine analyze the malware. “The fact that they have tools that allow them to do that is very concerning for the future, as well.”The attackers may have broken into the electrical company’s systems as early as February, Ukrainian officials said, but they emphasized that some details of the attack, including how the intruders made their way into the company’s systems, were not yet known. Officials declined to name the company that suffered the breach and the region its substations are in, citing fears of continuing cyberattacks. “It is self-evident that the aggressor’s team, the malefactors, had enough time to get prepared very thoroughly and they planned the execution on a sophisticated, high-quality level,” said Victor Zhora, the deputy head of Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. “It looks that we have been very lucky that we were able to respond in a timely manner to this cyberattack.”Ukrainian companies in finance, media and energy have been subject to regular cyberattacks since the war began, according to Mr. Zhora. His agency said that since Russia’s invasion began, it had recorded three times as many attacks as it had tracked in the previous year.The use of wiper malware has become a persistent problem in Ukraine since the war began, with attacks hitting Ukrainian critical infrastructure, including government agencies responsible for food safety, finance and law enforcement, cybersecurity researchers said.Hackers have also broken into communications systems, including satellite communication services and telecom companies. Investigations into those breaches are continuing, although cybersecurity analysts and U.S. officials believe Russia is responsible. Other hacking groups, including one affiliated with Belarus, have broken into media companies’ systems and social media accounts of high-profile military officials, trying to spread disinformation that claimed Ukraine planned to surrender.“They are targeting critical infrastructure; however, these attempts were not so sophisticated as compared to today’s recent attack,” Mr. Zhora said of the recent hacking campaigns against Ukrainian companies. The Justice Department said last week that it had disrupted another cyberattack orchestrated by the G.R.U. Russian hackers had infected networks of private computers with malicious software to create a botnet that could have been used for surveillance or destructive attacks, the department said.But the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation disconnected the networks from the G.R.U.’s own controllers before the botnet could be used in an attack. Using court orders, the F.B.I. gained access to corporate networks in the United States and removed the malware, sometimes without the company’s knowledge, U.S. officials said.Some analysts believed that Russia would back up its ground invasion with crippling cyberattacks and were puzzled when widespread hacking campaigns did not materialize during the early days of the war. But cybersecurity experts said the complex attack on the electrical company was a sign that Russia was beginning to shift its tactics.“We see a shift in what’s going on, on the ground, and we see a shift in what’s going on in the cyberrealm as well,” Mr. Boutin said. As Russia reorganizes its troops in Ukraine, it may also begin a new cybercampaign, he added.“If the Russian advance has dissipated,” Mr. Hultquist said, “this may be another way for them to put pressure on Ukraine.”Vivek Shankar contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/us/politics/ukraine-russian-cyberattack.html
103,"WARSAW — Warsaw’s biggest pediatric hospital has put patients from Ukraine on its waiting list for liver transplants, sometimes ahead of Polish children. Schools in Poland’s capital have had to search for extra teachers to keep up with the influx of new pupils. Public transport has risked buckling under the strain of so many new residents.Yet, to just about everyone’s surprise, Warsaw has kept working, defying predictions of a breakdown and an angry public backlash. The city, which has welcomed hundreds of thousands of fleeing refugees, has decked itself with Ukrainian flags and banners of support for Poland’s war-ravaged eastern neighbor.But just as the tsunami of refugees, which increased the capital’s population by nearly 20 percent in just a few weeks, seemed to be receding, Warsaw’s mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, is now bracing for a possible new influx as Russia’s military pushes to achieve what President Vladimir V. Putin last week vowed would be the “full completion” of his war in Ukraine.“Warsaw is at capacity,” Mr. Trzaskowski, a liberal opponent of Poland’s conservative governing party, Law and Justice, said in an interview. “We accepted more than 300,000 people but we cannot accept more. With the escalation by Russia in eastern Ukraine we could have a second wave.”ImageRafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesIt looked for a few days as if the rush into Poland was over as Russia’s retreat from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, encouraged some Ukrainians to risk returning home and others to stay put. For the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, on Feb. 24, Poland’s border service announced in April that the number of people arriving from Ukraine had been outnumbered by those crossing the other way.But that trend, the mayor fears, is unlikely to hold and, if significantly reversed with a new surge of refugees, could push an already strained city beyond its limits.“Imagine your city suddenly increased by 15 to 20 percent: what an incredible pressure this would be and what it would cost to normal services of the city like public transportation, sanitation, education and so on,” the mayor said. “These costs run to hundreds of millions of dollars.”At Warsaw’s central railway station on Friday, a major hub of Ukrainians going in either direction, Natalia Glinskaya, 54, said she left Ukraine in March, moved on to Sweden via Poland and returned to Warsaw this week with plans to take a train back home.But after learning that Russian shells had fallen early Friday on her hometown east of Dnipro, she put that plan on hold. Though a Russian speaker, like most Ukrainians in the east of the country, she cursed Mr. Putin, who claims to be defending Russian speakers from persecution, calling him a “crazy terrorist” capable of anything.“I’m going back and forth about what to do now,” she said, predicting that Russia’s offensive in the east would deter many Ukrainians from returning home and encourage others to leave, particularly after Sunday’s Orthodox Easter, an important family holiday.“Then there will be a second wave,” she said.ImageUkrainian refugees lining up last month at the National Stadium in Warsaw to receive Polish identification numbers.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesFigures released this past week by Poland’s border authorities showed the number of Ukrainians leaving and arriving roughly balancing out on some days. As Orthodox Easter drew nearer, however, more people returned to be with their families in Ukraine than arrived, with the Polish border service reporting on Saturday that 19,900 people had crossed into Poland from Ukraine the previous day, while 23,800 went the other way.After a peak of more than 30,000 Ukrainians arriving in Warsaw each day last month, the number declined to just a few hundred last week. The figure is now creeping up again, with two or three thousand refugees now coming to the capital each day, mostly from the eastern Donbas region.Many Ukrainians who have fled to Poland since Russia invaded are agog at how well they have been received.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.“It is wonderful to have a kind neighbor like this when our neighbor to the east attacks us with such cruelty,” said Roksolana Tyymochko-Voloshyn, 34, who arrived last month with her cancer-stricken 7-year-old son, Volodymyr.Driven from the border straight to Warsaw in an ambulance, they were taken to the Children’s Memorial Health Institute, a sprawling medical complex southeast of the capital, to treat her son’s eye tumor. He was halfway through a course of 25 radiation treatments in Kyiv when they fled Ukraine. His mother, who left her husband behind to fight, is at his bedside day and night.Marek Migdal, the director of the pediatric hospital, said that patients from Ukraine “get exactly the same rights to treatment as Polish citizens,” and he initially worried that “if their number increases our capacity will not be sufficient.”The number of Ukrainian admissions, however, stabilized as hospitals elsewhere in Poland and abroad took in Ukrainian children in desperate need of medical care. ImageVolodymyr Voloshyn, 7, being treated for an eye tumor at the Children’s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw last month.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesFew of the Ukrainian children admitted to the Warsaw pediatric hospital needed treatment for war wounds. But the war, by choking supplies of medicine and diverting doctors, has put their lives at risk. “If we cannot help these children, we will be responsible for their deaths,” said Piotr Socha, a Polish doctor at the health institute responsible for a ward treating liver disease. “Ukraine cannot help them. We have to help.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

An upsurge of fighting in eastern Ukraine, he added, could prompt a new exodus to Poland by people who had previously decided to remain but who “have seen the atrocities in Bucha, Irpin and other places and are on now the move” as Russian forces bear down on villages and cities in the east.“We cannot improvise any more,” he said, recalling how, in the absence of a clear national strategy, he had to call fellow mayors and beg them to send buses to Warsaw to help relieve the strain on the capital.Most of the help for Ukrainian refugees, the mayor said, has come from local governments, private citizens and “exactly the same kind of organizations that were deprived of financing by the central government for years because they were fighting for refugees, for women’s rights, the L.G.B.T. community and all the minorities.”“These are the nongovernmental groups that have saved us,” he said.ImageUkrainian refugees in Krakow, Poland, singing their national anthem during an antiwar protest this past week.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesIn all, Poland has taken in nearly three million Ukrainians, winning the country widespread praise abroad and helping the central government shake off it reputation as callous and hostile to foreigners. Just a few months ago, Polish border guards and soldiers used batons and water cannons to prevent would-be asylum seekers, many from the Middle East, from sneaking across the border from Belarus.Mr. Trzaskowski, a longtime foe of the conservative national government, will visit the United States next week looking for help with lifting his city’s heavy burdens.“It is great if Poland’s image is improving,” he said. But, referring to the governing Law and Justice party, he added that “one should not forget that these guys are still breaking the rule of law and attacking independent institutions.”The city government provided temporary housing for more than 70,000 Ukrainians in unused office blocks and sports halls but, Mr. Trzaskowski said, far more refugees found shelter with family and friends or with “complete strangers who, in a month or two, might say, ‘I cannot prolong this offer for much longer.’”Those with sick children often sleep at the hospital. Alina Babyna, who traveled to Poland seeking treatment for her 11-year-old son, Yevgenii, gravely ill with a rare liver disease, sleeps at her son’s bedside and has no plans to stay in Poland indefinitely, saying she left Ukraine only after doctors at a Kyiv hospital where her son was being treated left to treat wounded soldiers near the front line.“I will definitely go home when we win the war,” she said. “Fate will decide. But I believe in God. I hope and know that he will help.”ImageAlina Babyna and her son, Yevgenii, 11, last month at a children’s hospital in Warsaw.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/ukraine-poland-refugees.html
104,"KYIV, Ukraine — Two top American officials, in a trip shrouded in secrecy, made a wartime journey to Kyiv on Sunday, where President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine planned to urge them to provide more aid in his nation’s battle against Russian invaders, a top Ukrainian official said.The U.S. government had been at extraordinary pains to keep everything about the trip by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III under wraps until the men were safely out of Ukraine, declining even to confirm that it was taking place.But it was an open secret.A day earlier, Mr. Zelensky disclosed plans for the highest-level U.S. delegation to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded two months ago. And in an interview broadcast on Sunday, as the U.S. government remained silent, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Ukrainian television that the men were there.“They’re right now in Kyiv, talking to the president,” Mr. Arestovich said. “Maybe something will be decided regarding how they can help.”Less secret was the agenda of the meeting: Ukraine’s plea for more military aid from Western allies as it tries to fend off an attack that has crushed cities and left thousands dead. One Ukrainian lawmaker said it sent “a powerful signal to Russia that Ukraine will not be left alone with this war.”ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky announced the visit by the U.S. officials at a news conference on Saturday.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesAlready, Congress has approved $13.6 billion in emergency spending related to the invasion, including for weapons, military supplies and one of the largest infusions of U.S. foreign aid to any country in the last decade. The funds also cover the deployment of U.S. troops to Europe. Days before the Americans’ visit, President Biden announced an additional $800 million in military aid, including equipment designed to help Ukraine fend off Russia’s offensive in the east. But top-level U.S. officials had not visited the country since it was invaded, even as European leaders went to witness firsthand evidence of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers in the suburbs of Kyiv. As Ukrainians celebrated Orthodox Easter, the head of Ukraine’s independent Orthodox church, Metropolitan Epiphaniy, met in Kyiv on Sunday with two visiting U.S. Congress members, Tim Walberg of Michigan and Victoria Spartz of Indiana, both Republicans.“Now, we are celebrating Easter, which is about Christ rising,” the metropolitan said. “We are sure that with his victory, we will have victory too.”But denouncing the Russians, he also endorsed the righteous use of force in self-defense.“In this difficult fight,” he said, “spirit is not enough. You also need weapons.”ImageDamage from a Russian bombardment in Kharkiv on Sunday.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesOn Sunday, that fight was raging in Mariupol, the eastern port city where Russia redoubled its assault after withdrawing its forces from the capital region, where they had encountered fierce resistance. A steel plant there where Ukrainian forces have been holding out has come under ferocious attack, but it remains under Ukrainian control — at least, for now.“We are prepared to leave the city because there is nothing left to defend,” Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, a Ukrainian commander, said by phone from inside the plant Sunday. “We consider that we’ve fulfilled our mission.”Given Russia’s new focus on seizing eastern Ukraine, a region filled with wide-open expanses of flatland, Ukrainian forces need more long-range weapons and the ability to quickly move troops on the ground and in the air, military analysts say.With long-range artillery cannons, helicopters, armored vehicles, tanks, radar defense systems and deadly drones now flowing into the country, Ukrainian leaders have said they have the opportunity not only to defend their land but also to drive the Russians out.Mr. Blinken was the last high-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine when he stopped there in mid-January. The United States closed its embassy in Kyiv on Feb. 14 and its diplomats soon left the country.Russia’s invasion began 10 days later, and as it tried to seize the capital in an initial offensive, parts of Kyiv were struck by shelling and Ukrainian and Russian forces fought in the streets of Kyiv’s suburbs. But Russia’s retreat from the area around Kyiv appears to have made the city far less dangerous than it was a few weeks ago, and Western leaders have been taking the opportunity to demonstrate solidarity with Mr. Zelensky.ImageIt was Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s first trip to Kyiv since January, when he met with Mr. Zelensky before Russia invaded.Credit...Pool photo by Alex BrandonIt remained unclear on Sunday exactly how Mr. Austin and Mr. Blinken got to Kyiv, where Mr. Zelensky has remained since Russia invaded the country.The distance makes air travel the obvious choice, but the Ukrainian government closed its airspace to civilian flights when the invasion began.Other leaders who visited, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, went by rail. But given the security concerns, his trip, too, was shrouded in secrecy. Rumors about an impending trip by Mr. Johnson had circulated for days, but no news of the journey itself became public until he was seen in Kyiv.In March, Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Poland, where she expressed American support for Ukraine and U.S. allies in NATO and the European Union. Mr. Blinken previously went as far as Poland’s border with Ukraine, meeting with Ukrainian diplomats at a crossing used by hundreds of refugees over the course of an hour.Mr. Biden also visited a town near the border on a state visit to Poland on March 25, but did not cross into Ukraine. He met with refugees and gave a speech in Warsaw the next day.ImagePresident Biden visiting Poland in March.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesPrevious visits by senior American officials to other war zones, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, were typically not announced until after the official had arrived in the country — and sometimes not even until after they had left.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.The White House has ruled out sending Mr. Biden to Ukraine, citing not only the risk but Mr. Biden’s enormous security requirements. Senior cabinet officials such as Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin travel with smaller entourages.On Sunday, as Ukrainians gathered for muted celebrations of Easter, Russia’s offensive claimed more lives.Before dawn, two young girls, aged 5 and 14, were killed when their home in the Donetsk region, near the eastern border with Russia, was destroyed, according to the Donetsk Regional Military Administration.Nearly 100 miles to the west, three Russian missiles slammed into the city of Pavlograd. The strikes damaged railway infrastructure and eight buildings and also killed a 48-year-old man, according to local authorities.In the eastern region of Luhansk, at least eight people were killed when seven houses and a police station were struck by Russian artillery fire, according to Ukrainian authorities.ImageAmbulance workers in the Donetsk region helping move a Ukrainian soldier injured by Russian shelling on Saturday.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressThe statements from state and local officials offered only a partial accounting of the growing toll as fighting along the 300-mile front line in eastern and southern Ukraine intensifies. The heavy fighting has so far resulted in only small gains for Russian forces, but the situation for civilians caught in the crossfire grows more dire by the day.The fighting once again hindered evacuation efforts.Igor Zhovkva, an adviser to President Zelensky, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that, despite claims from Russia that it had taken control of the port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian forces and civilians remained in the city. Many soldiers were wounded, he said.“Today, we turn to Russian authorities to open the humanitarian corridors for civilians,” he said.With the city in ruins, an estimated 120,000 people are surviving in what witnesses have described as barbaric conditions. Ukrainian officials said Sunday that Russian forces were continuing to bombard the sprawling steel factory where hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are trapped.Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, said Captain Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, whose fighters have been holed up at the plant since March 1.“We will continue to defend it until there is an order to retreat from our military leadership,” he said. “And if we are going to leave, we are going to leave with our weapons.”Andrew E.

105,"Stung by war losses and massing troops for a new battle in eastern Ukraine, Russia has warned the Biden administration to stop supplying advanced weapons to Ukrainian forces or face “unpredictable consequences,” American officials said Friday.The Russian message — one of a series of warnings punctuated by a formal protest note, delivered on Tuesday — suggested rising concerns in Moscow that the weapons were seriously hindering Russia’s combat capabilities.The existence of the message was disclosed as the Kremlin was funneling armaments, including attack helicopters, to Russia’s border with eastern Ukraine for the next phase of its two-month-old invasion of the country.Over the course of the war, the U.S. administration has provided increasingly heavier weapons to the Ukrainians — including 155-mm howitzers — as the conflict has ramped up, and it announced a new $800 million arms package this week.Back in February, as the war began, the administration worried such weaponry could unnecessarily provoke Russia. But after coming under pressure from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and members of Congress from both parties, the administration has decided to provide some of the kinds of heavy weapons it says Ukraine will require in the next phase of the war.The Russian warnings have come as the invasion has met unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance and has exposed weaknesses in Russia’s conventional armed forces.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has installed a new command to oversee the Ukraine war and this past week publicly suggested for the first time that Russia’s goals were limited to securing the Donbas, the section of eastern Ukraine bordering Russia where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.Russia’s goals when its military invaded on Feb. 24 appeared far more ambitious, with plans to besiege and capture the capital, Kyiv, in the north, cutting off Mr. Zelensky’s government from the rest of the former Soviet republic, which Mr. Putin has said he does not even consider a country.That strategy backfired and Russian forces retreated last month. They also have failed to completely seize the strategic southeast port of Mariupol despite relentless bombardments that have turned that once bustling city of 450,000 into a wasteland of death and war’s destructive horrors.Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region of Eastern Ukraine, told CNN on Friday that Ukrainian troops were still in control of Mariupol, but that the city had been “wiped off the face of the earth by the Russian Federation, by those who will never be able to restore it.”ImageDestruction near the Illich Steel and Iron Works plant in Mariupol on Friday.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersIn what appeared to be another military embarrassment for Russia that it has sought to cover up, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday that Russia’s Black Sea flagship Moskva, a missile cruiser that sank Thursday, had been struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles, and not crippled by an accidental fire and explosion during a storm, as the Kremlin has asserted.It was the first American corroboration of Ukraine’s claims that its Neptune missiles — a newly deployed weapon with a 190-mile range — had hit the ship, which was struck 65 miles south of the port of Odesa.The loss of the Moskva was more than just a humiliation, as it could now seriously impair any Kremlin plans for an amphibious assault on Ukraine’s southern coast. The loss also raised questions about Russian dominance of Ukraine’s airspace and the apparent inability of the Moskva, a sophisticated warship, to evade or intercept the Neptunes with its own defense systems.The U.S. official said that American intelligence assessments had indicated an unspecified number of casualties, contradicting Russian claims that all crew members had been safely evacuated. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008306334"");

But it was an indicator, one administration official said, that the weapons sent by the United States were having an effect.American officials said the tone of the note was consistent with a series of public Russian threats, including to target deliveries of weapons as they moved across Ukrainian territory.Officials said the note did not prompt any special concern inside the White House. But it has touched off a broader discussion inside the Pentagon and intelligence agencies about whether the “unpredictable consequences” could include trying to target or sabotage some of the weapons shipments while still in NATO territory, before they are transferred to Ukrainians for the final journey into the hands of Ukrainian troops. The delivery of the protest note was first reported by The Washington Post.The weapons President Biden authorized this week for transfer to the Ukrainians include long-range artillery that is suited for what American officials believe will be a different style of battle in the open areas of the Donbas, where Russian forces appear to be massing for an attack in coming days. Pentagon officials were insistent in the run-up to the war that the United States provide only defensive weaponry that would avoid escalation.Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, described in an interview at the Washington Economic Club on Thursday how he and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had reviewed weapons requests. They went over each item with their Ukrainian counterparts, talking about what the United States had in its stocks and what it could deliver quickly.Reports by pro-Kremlin media have highlighted antitank systems and other Western weapons used by Ukrainian forces, promoting the idea that Russia is not at war with Ukraine but with an American-led alliance seeking to destroy Russia. Mr. Biden and his aides have denied that, saying that they wished to avoid direct conflict with Russia and had no interest in American-engineered regime change.In Moscow, commentators have been increasingly calling on Russia to strike Ukrainian roads and railroads to inhibit the weapons transfers. While Russia has targeted many of Ukraine’s airports, the country’s ground transportation network remains largely intact.“The time has come not to speak, but to attack,” Viktor Baranets, a military columnist for Komsomolskaya Pravda, Russia’s biggest tabloid, said on Friday. “Train echelons must be destroyed along with the railways.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

Ryabkov, said on Friday that Russia was “making it clear to the Americans and other Westerners” that attempts to hamper what Russia is calling its “special military operation” in Ukraine and increase Russian losses would be “curbed in a tough manner.”ImageUkrainians pulling an abandoned Russian tank from a field near the village of Lypivka, west of Kyiv, on Friday.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesHe added that NATO vehicles carrying weapons across Ukrainian territory would be “viewed by us as legitimate military targets.” His comments came in an interview with Tass, the state-run news agency.NATO hands off weapons to the Ukrainians in ways that seek to avoid having the alliance’s vehicles traverse Ukrainian soil. But Mr. Ryabkov’s comments have heightened concerns about whether Russia would take the risk of striking inside NATO territory.When Mr. Putin announced his “special military operation” on Feb. 24, he said that those “who may be tempted to interfere” in Ukraine would face consequences as severe “as you have never seen in your entire history.”ImageA photo released by Russian state media shows President Vladimir V. Putin chairing a Security Council meeting via videoconference on Friday in Moscow.Credit...Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik“No matter how the events unfold, we are ready,” Mr. Putin said at the time. “All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken.”But Russia has so far appeared careful not to escalate the conflict in a way that could draw NATO countries more directly — for instance, not striking weapons convoys crossing into Ukraine from Poland.“There are still fears regarding strikes that may hit the territory of NATO member countries,” Mr. Kortunov said. “One certainly does not want to create a pretext for some further escalation.”David E.

107,"WASHINGTON — The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, a symbol of the country’s dominance of the region and a powerful war machine that had been used to launch precision cruise missiles deep inside Ukraine.Despite claims by Russia that an accidental fire broke out on the ship, U.S. officials confirmed on Friday that two Ukrainian Neptune missiles had struck the vessel, killing an unknown number of sailors and sending it and its arsenal to the bottom of the Black Sea.The sinking of the Moskva on Thursday was a grave blow to the Russian fleet and a dramatic demonstration of the current era of warfare in which missiles fired from shore can destroy even the biggest, most powerful ships. It was also the most significant combat loss for any navy since 1982, when Argentina’s Air Force sank a British guided missile destroyer and other ships during the Falklands War. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008306334"");

The Kremlin’s most powerful missile platform is impossible to replace, and its sinking was a bold counterattack, retired military officers said.The Moskva inspired awe in those who saw it — bristling with missiles and looming over the landscape — and was the embodiment of Russian power in the region for decades.“It was a very impressive ship,” said retired Rear Adm. Samuel J. Cox, the director of the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. “With those surface-to-surface missile launchers, she really looks dangerous. But apparently, she can’t take a punch.”The vessel’s sinking has symbolic, diplomatic and military importance.Russian ships have already been pushed farther off the Ukrainian coast, U.S. officials confirmed, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments of the war. The remainder of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is still within range to launch cruise missiles into Ukraine but is unable to support any sort of amphibious assault on the country’s coastal cities, according to former officials.Naval analysts have worried for years that a new generation of ship-killing missiles would endanger large and important ships like the Moskva or the United States’ fleet of aircraft carriers. The sinking of the Moskva is a clear sign that the future has arrived.The Moskva was itself designed as a ship killer. Construction of the ship, originally known as the Slava, began in 1976, and the vessel went into service in 1983. Built by the Soviet Union to sink American carriers, it was armed with missiles capable of striking planes, ships and submarines.Upgraded many times over the years, the Moskva should have had defenses to shoot down the Ukrainian missiles. The ship was armed with a medium-range surface-to-air system that was thought to be effective within seven miles, and it also had other missiles designed to take out threats 50 miles away. In theory, its guns could have shot down a Neptune missile as well. But none of those defenses worked.“Warfare is a brutal thing,” said retired Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations. “You have to make the investments to defeat the kinds of weapons that people are going to throw at you.”Anti-ship weapons are not hard to build or field. Hezbollah struck an Israeli warship in the Lebanon war in 2006. Houthi rebels in Yemen fired multiple anti-ship missiles at a U.S. Navy destroyer in two separate attacks in 2016, which drew retaliatory Tomahawk cruise missile attacks in response. While the U.S. Navy has invested in antimissile technology for decades, American war planners have said that China’s missiles would pose a real threat in a conflict.While symbolically painful for Russia, the loss of the Moskva also has practical effects on the ongoing war. Missiles that would have been fired at Ukraine are now at the bottom of the Black Sea, a blow to Russia’s war plans.The Moskva would have played a primary role in any potential amphibious assault on the Ukrainian coastal city of Odesa. While other landing ships would have been used to bring Russian naval infantry to the coastline, the Moskva would have protected those ships and launched missile strikes on the city.Now, Admiral Cox said, any amphibious assault on Ukraine will be much more dangerous for Russia, with its landing and amphibious ships much more vulnerable to attacks.The farther Russian ships are from the coast, the more limited their support for ground assaults on Ukrainian cities will be. While the greater distance could make some attacks more difficult, it would not put Russia’s more powerful missiles out of range. Some of Russia’s sea-launched cruise missiles can reach 1,550 miles, while Ukraine’s Neptune missiles have a range of about 190 miles.Before the strike on the Moskva, a senior Defense Department official said, the Russian Black Sea Fleet operated with relative impunity.“They thought they could run around the Black Sea and go anywhere they wanted,” said retired Adm. James G. Foggo III, the dean of the Center for Maritime Strategy at the Navy League of the United States. “They found out otherwise.”Preventing an attack on Odesa has been a priority of Ukraine’s military, which for weeks has been asking the United States and its allies for additional anti-ship missiles and other so-called coastal defense weaponry.Senior Ukrainian officials have told the Pentagon that they need the anti-ship missiles and other weaponry to open a new front and turn back the Russian invasion, U.S. officials said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.The strike on the Moskva showed that Ukraine’s requests were “very prescient,” the senior Defense Department official said.By building up coastal defenses, Admiral Foggo said, the Ukrainians will be able to engage the Russian fleet even without a powerful navy. Missiles, smart mines and other advanced devices will help them keep Russian ships away.“You don’t necessarily need to have a battleship to go out and protect the shores of Ukraine,” he said. “It’s easier to fire from the shore. It’s easier to defend than it is to attack. So now the Russians have a problem.”The United States responded to Ukraine’s request by adding coastal defense weapons to an $800 million package announced this week. Senior Pentagon officials also asked American military contractors in a meeting on Wednesday to develop proposals for additional anti-ship missiles that the United States could provide to Ukraine or its allies.Some American officials said they were puzzled at why Russia had continued to claim that the Moskva was destroyed in an accident and not by a Ukrainian strike. Russia remains eager to play down Ukraine’s military successes to the Russian public. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that senior Russian officials have not given President Vladimir V. Putin accurate accounts of the Ukraine war, and former officials said Russian military officials most likely lied to the Kremlin about what happened to the Moskva.“Losing the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is like losing a crown jewel: a serious prestige damage, which, I believe, has likely hit Putin personally given how much importance he has attached to rebuilding Russia as a naval great power,” said Katarzyna Zysk, a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies in Oslo.The sinking of the Moskva, officials said, also demonstrated the strategic importance for Ukraine of expanding the battle from the country’s towns to the Black Sea, where Russia’s fleet has long dominated. And it revealed, Admiral Foggo said, deep problems in the Russian military. Well-trained sailors should have been able to contain the flooding caused by the missile strikes, put out the fire and save the ship, he said.While few American analysts would have predicted that the Ukrainians could have destroyed the Moskva, officials said that at this point in the war, no one should be surprised by Ukraine’s capabilities.And the sinking of the ship is one of the most high-profile blows yet landed by the Ukrainian military.“It is striking to think about how damaging this will be to the morale of the Russian Navy, given the symbolic name, its role as a flagship and the fact that it is a combat casualty,” said retired Adm. James G. Stavridis, a former supreme allied commander in Europe. “In terms of the Russians losing such a significant unit, yes, you have to go back to World War II.”Julian E.

108,"NEW DELHI — As international outrage over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine boiled over, foreign ministers and envoys filed in to New Delhi, hoping to pull India off the fence and into clearer condemnation of Russia, its longtime ally.The United States offered a mix of carrots and sticks: signaling a willingness to expand defense cooperation with India, long dependent on Moscow for a majority of its weapons, but also calling India a “shaky” member of an important alliance of democracies known as the Quad. Prime ministers of Japan and Australia, both part of that alliance, held meetings with India’s leaders. Israel announced that its prime minister would arrive soon.But when the United Nations again voted last week on a resolution critical of the Russian aggression, India stuck to abstaining. Then India further emphasized its relative neutrality: It also abstained from supporting a resolution that favored Russia. Instead, India called for an end to hostilities and respect for the territorial integrity of states — an expression of displeasure with Russia’s war without calling it out as an aggressor.The Russian invasion of Ukraine and its backlash offer the latest manifestations of India’s effort to chart its own path through rapid changes in the world order in recent years. At the center of it is an increasing clarity among India’s foreign policy strategists that the country cannot afford to take sides in what is increasingly a multipolar world, officials and analysts say.ImagePresident Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined a summit meeting of leaders of the “Quad” nations in the East Room of the White House in September.Credit...Pool photo by Sarahbeth ManeyIndia’s vulnerabilities — including a slowing economy that is struggling to meet the demands of a growing population and an ill-equipped military stretched on two fronts by territorial disputes with China and Pakistan — are such that it needs allies far and wide, even if it means New Delhi has to work with the harsh reality of those allies’ bitterly opposing each other.After decades spent trying to delicately navigate the Cold War legacy of a bipolar world, it is facing even more complications, including the rise of an expansionist China on its doorstep.“Our position is not that this is not our problem — our position is that we are for peace,” Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, told the country’s Parliament on the day India again chose to abstain from voting against Russia at the United Nations. “Indian foreign policy decisions are made in Indian national interest, and we are guided by our thinking, our views, our interests.”The debate in the Upper House that day was indicative of the difficult waters India is navigating.There was talk of a Western “double game” in pressuring India to stop oil purchases from Russia, just about 1 percent of its overall oil imports, while Europe continued buying Russian oil. But there was also questions of what India’s neutral position means for its security. Does India risk angering the United States and other Quad countries partnered in bolstering security against China? What if Russia and China drew closer as a result of the Western sanctions?Image Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China and Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India greeting the news media before their meeting in New Delhi on Friday.Credit...Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar's Twitter handle, via Associated PressDr. Jaishankar is in a unique position, at once the chief theorist of India’s vision for a path in this complicated new world order and the person responsible for the difficult work of implementing of that vision.During his four decades in India’s foreign service, he held ambassadorial postings in Washington and Beijing before retiring in 2018 as the country’s highest-ranking bureaucrat in the service. He was chosen by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to become foreign minister a year later, but he used the gap to produce a book, “The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World,” on the country’s foreign policy doctrine.In the book, a favorite reference of foreign diplomats in New Delhi, he attributes much of the challenge of the fluctuating world to the consequences of a “greater individualism, more insularity and sharp retrenchment” by the United States in recent years, along with the rise of a more aggressive China.“It would require advancing national interests by identifying and exploiting opportunities created by global contradictions,” Dr. Jaishankar wrote.Just how delicate that work is in practice played out last week, during the visit to New Delhi by the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.ImageAn Indian Army convoy on the Srinagar-Ladakh highway at Gagangeer, northeast of Srinagar in Indian-controlled Kashmir, in September 2020.Credit...Dar Yasin/Associated PressIt was the first ministerial visit between the two countries since the deadly skirmishes in the Himalayan borders two years ago, which have kept the relations tense. Indian officials stressed that the meetings with Mr. Wang were aimed at expediting the disengagement of the tens of thousands of troops, a slow process despite 15 rounds of talks between the two militaries.But many analysts saw in the timing of the visit, and the messaging from Beijing and Moscow around it, an effort to exploit the divergence between New Delhi and Washington — and even to show India in one bloc with Russia and China.More such efforts are likely. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who has listed India and China among countries “who would never accept the global village under the American sheriff,” is expected to arrive in New Delhi later this week.ImageForeign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia, center, and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, second from right, attending a meeting with Dr. Jaishankar and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi in December.Credit...Russian Foreign Ministry, via ReutersIndia’s difficult choices are driven by its own vulnerabilities — particularly an economy that is not living up to its potential — and the legacy of decades of dependence on Moscow and mistrust of Washington.India lagged far behind China in opening up its economy, missing out on the early benefits of globalization that turned Beijing into a giant. India’s smaller G.D.P. — about $3 trillion, one-sixth of China’s — and the needs of a population of 1.4 billion have constrained the country’s military spending. “Ultimately, the real security lies in economic growth and, you know, quickly getting to something close to $10 trillion,” said Arvind Panagariya, an economics professor at Columbia University who formerly advised Mr. Modi. “Basically what China did. Who would have taken China seriously until 1990?”For a large part of India’s independent history, its leaders have looked to Moscow not just for weapons’ supplies, but also for political support at the United Nations. Moscow remained a steady ally when Washington repeatedly upset New Delhi, including aiding Pakistan — India’s enemy — and imposing sanctions on India for developing nuclear weapons.ImageThe long-range ballistic Agni-V missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, during the Republic Day parade in New Delhi in 2013. India successfully test-fired an Agni-V in 2021, raising tensions with China.Credit...Manish Swarup/Associated PressEven as the ties with Washington have grown to a point that the United States is now India’s largest trading partner, there are still jolts of hesitance for New Delhi. The latest came from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. India had closely aligned its interests there with the American presence, only to see the United States leave Afghanistan to the Taliban, which New Delhi has long seen as a proxy of a Pakistani military that is hand in glove with Beijing.The Latest on China: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach could have far-reaching effects and has revived concerns that the country is going back to a planned economy.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.A new security deal. The Solomon Islands signed a sweeping security agreement with China that could threaten the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The deal gives Beijing a foothold in an island chain that played a decisive role in World War II and could be used to block vital shipping lanes.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.In its quest for “strategic autonomy,” India has been slow in creating distance from Moscow. While India has increased its weapon purchases from the United States from little to about $20 billion in the past decade, it still depends on Russia for about 60 percent of its military equipment.“I think people in the U.S. government understand and appreciate the complexities of India’s position,” said Kenneth Juster, the former U.S. ambassador to New Delhi. “But the atrocities committed by Putin will pose a challenge for India and other countries in terms, at some point, of having to further distance themselves from what he’s doing.”ImagePrime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan attending a virtual Quad meeting with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi; President Biden; and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia in March.Credit...Japan’s Cabinet Public Relations Office, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Indian government’s confidence that its divergence from Western pressure on Russia will ultimately not damage its relations is rooted in the fact that India is an important potential check on China’s expansionist foreign policy.New Delhi joined the Quad alliance despite strong opposition from Russia and China, which have both likened it to a NATO in the east aiming to encircle China. But India has maintained its balancing act, buying weapons from Russia, including a missile defense system, despite threats of U.S. sanctions.About two weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the leaders of the Quad held a summit meeting that was seen as a show of unity despite India’s not being on the same page on Russia’s war.ImageSoldiers in Russian-made T-90 tanks during a ceremony to celebrate India’s 73rd Army Day in New Delhi in January last year.Credit...Prakash Singh/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“As far as the Pentagon is concerned, we are a pin on the map in the Indian Ocean region,” said Tara Kartha, who served in India’s National Security Council for nearly two decades. “We are not that in Europe, where we have no role to play in hard defense terms.”Russia’s brutal campaign in Ukraine, and the possibility that Moscow will most likely emerge diminished from the war and sanctions, may accelerate India’s shift away from Moscow and facilitate an expansion of defense ties with the United States, some analysts said.But Dr. Kartha said that would be a slower process requiring the bureaucracies of both sides to overcome rooted hesitancy. There remains a “deep distrust of the U.S.” in the Indian bureaucracy because of a legacy of seeing Washington as patronizing and unreliable.“The U.S. bureaucracy has a lot of ifs and buts before it signs anything, while you have Russia coming and saying, ‘OK, let’s do this co-production’ and it’s done,” Dr. Kartha said. “Unless the U.S. is able to get past its own bureaucracy and its own way of thinking, we will still continue to be dependent on Russia.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/world/asia/india-ukraine-russia-china.html

More than a dozen patients died during a weekslong Russian siege. Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesUnder Russian occupationIn the areas of Ukraine recently liberated from Russian occupation, disturbing stories emerged of terror and death that Russian soldiers inflicted on Ukrainian civilians under their control.Every day, Ukrainian investigators discover new bodies of villagers who have been shot in the head or bear signs of torture. Accounts are surfacing of civilians dying from lack of food, water or heat.Russian troops meted out much of this misery in small towns near Kyiv, the capital, that they captured in the early days of the war before Ukrainian forces drove them out two weeks ago.Our correspondent Jeffrey Gettleman and journalist Oleksandr Chubko reported from Borodianka, north of Kyiv, about a nightmarish ordeal at a Ukrainian mental health facility.A squad of Chechen soldiers burst through the gate on March 5 and ordered the 500 patients and staff members at the special care home into a courtyard, at gunpoint. “We thought we were going to be executed,” said Maryna Hanitska, the home’s director.The soldiers pulled out a camera and told the director to make everyone smile. They then told her to look into the camera and thank Vladimir Putin. She managed to utter: “Thank you for not killing us.”The siege dragged on for weeks, during which the building lost heat, water and electricity, and more than a dozen patients died.In Makariv, another small town near Kyiv, the authorities said they recently discovered 20 corpses in yards and homes, many bearing the marks of torture. In the Brovary area farther east, police officers found six bodies in a cellar, all men who had apparently been executed.The bodies of at least 900 civilians killed by Russian forces as the troops withdrew from the Kyiv region have been discovered, a senior Ukrainian police official said today.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky speaking in Kyiv this week.Credit...Sergei Supinsky/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesZelensky in his own wordsPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has given several interviews this week that provide some insight into his mind-set as Ukraine prepares for what is expected to be a long and bloody battle with Russia in the east. Here are highlights:No time for optimism: If Russian troops are not expelled from Ukraine’s eastern provinces, Zelensky told The Atlantic, “they can return to the center of Ukraine and even to Kyiv. It is possible. Now is not yet the time of victory.” He added: “We have a very small window of opportunity.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Asking world leaders for weapons: “I come and say that I need this particular weapon. You have it and here it is; we know where it is stored. Can you give it to us? We can even fly our own cargo planes and pick it up; we can even send three planes per day. We need armored vehicles, for example. And not one per day. We need 200 to 300 per day. These aren’t personal taxis, just for me; our soldiers need transport.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.On Russian leadership: Russians need leaders they choose and trust, “leaders who can then come in and say, ‘Yes, we did that.’ That’s how it worked in Germany.”Putin’s nuclear threat: Zelensky told CNN that “all of the world, all of the countries, have to be worried” about the possibility that Putin could use a nuclear weapon. On Europe’s reliance on Russian energy: European countries that continue to buy Russian oil are “earning their money in other people’s blood,” Zelensky told the BBC.The war: “They can destroy us, but we will answer; they can kill but they will also die,” he said. “I can’t understand for what — I can’t understand why they came.”What else we’re followingIn UkraineThe loss of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet flagship, the Moskva, will make it more difficult to gain full control over Ukraine’s southern coast or try to take over Odesa, military analysts say.Ukraine’s defense minister goaded Russia over the sinking of its flagship, suggesting that the wreck would become a popular diving attraction.Our reporters look at why the prosecution of war crimes that occurred in Ukraine could take years.A new U.S. package of military aid includes weapons once considered too risky to provide to Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reports.Around the worldA Times video team reported from the Transnistria region of Moldova to see how disinformation spreads beyond Russia’s borders.Russian media is increasingly using Fox News to bolster the Kremlin’s narrative about the war.Europe’s harder line on Russia could evolve into a more antagonistic stance toward China.Russians, Ukrainians and Norwegians have lived side by side for decades on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.

Even people who once looked askance at defense contractors are suddenly cheering on the success of the companies’ deadly wares, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Switchblade drones, which “loiter” above a target before zooming in for the kill.If we’re honest with ourselves, though, the moral calculation here is complex. For starters, the Russian soldiers who are dying are mostly kids who are following the orders of the real criminals, mainly President Vladimir Putin, who is safe back in Moscow. People may be a bit too triumphant when they share videos of tank explosions on social media. It hit me hard on Monday when one of my colleagues in the Opinion section, Alex Kingsbury, wrote in a Slack channel, “Every blown-up tank on Twitter is the breaking of several Russian mothers’ hearts.” (He gave me permission to quote him.)The weapons that are defending Ukraine today could just as easily be used by the bad guys in some future conflict. In fact, if history is any guide, they almost certainly will be. Javelins, Stingers and Switchblades are not inherently good. They are at best morally neutral. You could even argue that they are essentially evil tools that are at times (such as now) being used for good purposes.Plus, the war in Ukraine is accelerating the global arms race, which is costly and potentially destabilizing. The United States and other members of NATO — notably Germany — are increasing defense budgets sharply. Russia will do its best to rebuild its depleted arsenal when this is over. China’s People’s Liberation Army is undoubtedly taking notes on Russia’s dismal performance to determine what additional weaponry it would need for a potential invasion of Taiwan.“Numerous parties with variegated interests are observing the battle performance of the weapons themselves, quite apart from battle tactics and war strategy,” Jurgen Brauer, an emeritus professor of economics at Augusta University’s Hull College of Business, wrote me in an email. “This is not new; prior to World War II, for instance, the incipient air battles in the Spanish Civil War attracted field observers from around the globe.”The deadly logic of an arms race is that each side’s effort to gain an edge is met by an equal or greater response from the other side. It is at best a zero-sum game and at worst lose-lose: a competition that winds up causing death and destruction all around.And yet. Even if you hate war, mourn the loss of life on both sides and fear the fueling of an arms race, it’s hard not to give at least a nod of respect to the likes of Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, the makers of the Javelin, and AeroVironment, whose Switchblade drones are being deployed against the Russians in eastern Ukraine. Without such weapons, all of Ukraine might have been conquered by now.Jeff Sommer, who writes the Strategies column for The Times, last month cited a pair of analysts at Citigroup, Charles J. Armitage and Samuel Burgess, who argued that weapons makers should be included in funds that are labeled E.S.G., meaning they pass muster on environmental, social and governance grounds.“Defending the free world against hostile dictators is probably not a bad thing,” Robert Stallard, who follows defense contractor stocks for Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a March 17 report. He added: “Perhaps the biggest change that could result from the invasion of Ukraine is a reversal of the lazy E.S.G. view that defense is ‘bad.’ Without the defense of our democratic system, personal freedoms and the rule of law, there would be no E.S.G.”I see both sides on this one. Unconditional pacifism is pure but impractical. President Barack Obama said as much in his Nobel Peace Prize lecture in 2009: “A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler’s armies. Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda’s leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism — it is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man and the limits of reason.”That recognition of history is why there are few unconditional pacifists. More common are people who support only “just” wars, such as those fought for self-defense, protection of innocents and perhaps punishment of wrongdoing. “I’m not a pacifist, really,” John Tepper Marlin, an economist and adjunct professor of ethics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told me this week. “If you want peace, be prepared for war. The issue becomes how much you spend for military versus social services.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts people who would like to wash their hands of war in a tricky spot. That includes people who don’t want their companies working for the Pentagon. In 2018, more than 3,000 employees of Google signed a petition opposing its participation in Project Maven, a Defense Department venture that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could improve drone targeting.It’s likewise complicated for E.S.G. funds that screen out defense contractors. I spoke with Andrew Montes, the director of digital strategies for As You Sow, a nonprofit based in Berkeley, Calif., that focuses on corporate accountability. He said: “We unequivocally condemn the invasion, and the Ukrainians have a right to defend themselves. But it’s a separate question if defense stocks belong in the portfolio.”“We try to take the view of long-term investors,” Montes went on. “If you’re investing in weapons companies, you’re essentially saying that you hope they are financially successful over the next 30 years.” In other words, even if you approve of the arming of the Ukrainians, you might not want to own shares in a company whose profits depend on the arms race continuing for years to come.Another group raising questions about investment in defense contractors is Datamaran, a company that uses software to screen companies for E.S.G. concerns. The defense contractors can argue that they’re on the right side in the Ukraine war, but “you cannot base your position on just the current context; you must consider past, present and future actions,” Marjella Lecourt-Alma, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, wrote in an email.The best outcome would be for today’s weapons to serve as peacemakers — to work so well against the Russians that Putin and other aggressors would think twice before invading a neighbor. “Before the invasion of Ukraine, there was a clear pattern of diminishing war in the world,” said Joshua Goldstein, an emeritus professor of international relations at American University. “There were just smaller civil wars, and fewer of those. The whole trend was in a positive direction. My hope is that this war will be such a spectacular failure that nobody can fail to draw the lesson that war is not a good way to get what you want.”ElsewhereU.S. consumer prices rose 8.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the most in nearly 41 years. But the inflation trend from now on is likely to be downward. This chart shows that there’s been some progress in relieving the pandemic bottlenecks that have contributed to the spike in inflation.ImageQuote of the day“If you want me to read the vast literature, cite me two papers that are exemplars and paragons of that literature.

112,"The United States, Britain and other Western allies, along with Ukraine’s government, are examining claims that Russia deployed a chemical agent that sickened a handful of people in Moscow’s unrelenting bid to gain complete control over the ruined Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Pytor Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said local officials believed that some chemical had been dropped by a drone on the city’s sprawling Azovstal steel plant, one of the last redoubts of the Ukrainian forces defending the city. They said it was unclear whether it was intended to be lethal.He said that it might be something like tear gas, but that they could not be certain.“It is absolutely correct information that yesterday from a drone, something was dropped in that area and some chemical things were in it,” he said. “But we don’t know for sure if it was poison or something else.”Ukrainian military commanders in the city said that Russian forces had used a drone on Monday to deploy “a poisonous substance of unknown origin” that caused respiratory difficulties and neurological symptoms that can be associated with chemical agents in a handful of soldiers and civilians.The reports, though unverified, are being treated seriously given the longstanding warnings by Western intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might use unconventional weapons to subdue Ukrainian opposition. Having failed to seize Kyiv and quickly topple the Ukrainian government, Russia has turned its focus to Ukraine’s east and south, and defeating the remaining forces in Mariupol is essential in Russia’s effort to gain wider control over the region.The United States, Britain and Australia said that they were monitoring the situation closely and that there would be consequences if chemical agents were indeed used.“These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said on Monday.ImageThe reports of possible chemical weapons use are being treated seriously given Western warnings that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might use unconventional weapons to subdue Ukraine.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersOn Tuesday morning, the Azov Battalion — a group that was founded as a far-right volunteer unit and is one of the main Ukrainian forces holding out in Mariupol — issued a statement and released a video on its official Telegram channel that purported to offer more details.The group said that at least three soldiers and civilians had been affected and that they were in “relatively satisfactory condition.” It said that the substance had been deployed close to Ukrainian military positions but “some distance” from civilian locations, and that it was “impossible to investigate the scene of the crime due to enemy fire.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, told a national television channel that the government was working to verify the information coming from Mariupol.The British military had said earlier on Monday that Russia had previously used phosphorus munitions as weapons in eastern Ukraine, and raised the possibility that they could be used in Mariupol. Phosphorus weapons are not considered chemical weapons, and their limited use — while controversial — is not forbidden under international law.Russia, like Ukraine and most other nations, has ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty that bans their use. Moscow was also instrumental in pressuring Syria’s government to join the treaty in 2013 after it was accused of using a poisonous nerve agent on civilians in that country’s civil war.But the Kremlin has sought to shield its Syrian ally from numerous accusations of chemical weapons use, calling such claims unsubstantiated or fictitious. Moscow has also been accused of using chemical agents to poison opponents including Alexei A. Navalny, the political figure. Russia denies these allegations.On Monday, Eduard Basurin, a spokesman for the Kremlin-backed separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, described the Mariupol steel factory as a “city within a city” and said that Russian forces should “turn to the chemical troops, who will find a way to smoke the moles out of their holes.”On Tuesday, Mr. Basurin said he had been referring to flamethrowers, not chemical weapons.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/europe/chemical-weapons-russia-mariupol.html
113,"IN POLAND, NEAR THE UKRAINIAN BORDER — Nearly 48 hours since leaving Washington on what was supposed to be a clandestine mission, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III met with reporters to discuss an operation that was nearly over before it began.“This was an important time to be there,” Mr. Blinken said Monday morning. “An important time for Ukraine, for the war, and an important moment to have face-to-face conversations in detail.”The visit also resulted in a striking redefinition of success for America’s goals in Ukraine.“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Mr. Austin said. “It had already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.”The two cabinet secretaries spoke in a warehouse standing in front of tall stacks of humanitarian aid, while across from them were green-painted wooden boxes of munitions for Soviet-designed weapons used by Ukrainian troops — striking visual reminders of the kinds of aid the United States is providing Kyiv.All of it would be inside Ukraine’s borders by the end of the day, Mr. Blinken said.Last week, Mr. Blinken’s and Mr. Austin’s staffs were planning a trip to an Air Force base in Ramstein, Germany, to meet with officials from other nations on Tuesday to discuss ways they could help Ukraine in its fight against Russia. A handful of those same staff members worked in parallel, on a need-to-know basis, to plan a stop beforehand in Kyiv so the secretaries could personally inform President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that President Biden would quickly re-establish the United States’ embassy in the Ukrainian capital and provide hundreds of millions of dollars in additional military aid. It would be an unannounced trip by the highest-level delegation of American officials since the Russian invasion began.Participants who ended their week thinking they would be leaving for Germany on Monday morning were told on Friday afternoon that plans had changed.Both Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin boarded military C-17 transport planes early Saturday morning at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, driving directly onto the tarmac and lifting off with the secrecy of their mission intact.That secret held until about halfway through the nine-hour flight to Poland.In an apparently unscripted remark Saturday afternoon during a news conference in the Ukrainian capital, Mr. Zelensky announced that Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin would be arriving in Kyiv the next day. Shortly afterward, a senior defense official emerged from Mr. Austin’s quarters in the C-17’s cargo hold and somewhat sheepishly informed the three reporters accompanying the defense secretary that President Zelensky had blown the operation’s cover and the future of the trip was uncertain.However, Pentagon officials had planned for a number of contingencies, and having details of the secret trip leak out was among them. So the two cabinet members’ planes pressed on.After arriving in Poland early Sunday morning, Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin climbed into cars and were driven across the border into Ukraine to begin an 11-hour train ride to Kyiv. They were accompanied by just a few of their staff members, and their location was tracked minute by minute in a U.S. military tactical operations center in Poland.While the secretaries were en route to Kyiv, a senior State Department official and a senior defense official offered reporters in Poland a preview of what Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin would be offering to Mr. Zelensky.The officials did not have any information on whether Marines would be posted to guard the embassy in Kyiv once it reopens, but they did add that Mr. Biden plans to quickly nominate an ambassador to lead it.According to the senior defense official, the first group of more than 50 Ukrainian artillery soldiers on Sunday completed their training on 155-millimeter howitzers provided by the United States, which are slightly different in design to the Soviet-era 152-millimeter guns that have been used by Ukrainian forces since the country gained independence. A second group of Ukrainian artillery specialists would soon begin another six-day training course, the official added.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.The cabinet secretaries returned to Poland, near the Ukrainian border, Monday morning after traveling nearly nonstop over the previous two days.Immediately after briefing reporters, Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin met with soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division and thanked the troops for their service, then boarded Air Force cargo planes to head to Ramstein.In Germany, Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin will be joined by the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the Ukrainian defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, to offer a battlefield update to officials from more than 20 nations. They are also expected to discuss the deployment of new military aid to Ukraine and how each country can use their own defense industries to produce goods in high demand by Ukraine.“The first step in winning is believing that you can win,” Mr. Austin told reporters. “And so they believe that we can win, we believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support.”“We’re going to do everything we can — continue to do everything we can to ensure that gets to them,” he added.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/blinken-austin-kyiv-ukraine.html
114,"During his recent speech in Warsaw, President Biden said that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” only to clarify a few days later that he was merely expressing outrage, not announcing a new U.S. policy aimed at toppling Russia’s leader. The episode, interpreted by many as a dangerous gaffe, underscored the tension in U.S. foreign policy between idealism and realism.Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine should provoke moral outrage in all of us, and, at least in principle, it warrants his removal from office. But Mr. Putin could well remain the leader of a major power into the next decade, and Washington will need to deal with him.This friction between lofty goals and realpolitik is nothing new. The United States has since the founding era been an idealist power operating in a realist world — and has on balance succeeded in bending the arc of history toward justice. But geopolitical exigency at times takes precedence over ideals, with America playing power politics when it needs to.During the Cold War, Washington promoted stability by tolerating a Soviet sphere of influence and cozying up to unsavory regimes willing to fight Communism. In contrast, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, America operated under conditions of geopolitical slack; great-power rivalry was muted, enabling Washington to put front and center its effort to promote democracy and expand a liberal, rules-based international order.What, then, is the path forward? The war in Ukraine now confronts the United States with the need to tilt back toward the practice of realpolitik. Washington’s commitment to keeping NATO’s doors open to Ukraine was a laudable and principled stand against an autocratic Russia. Yet America’s idealist cause has run headlong into Russian tanks; Washington’s effort to do right by Ukraine has culminated in Russia’s ruthless effort to put the country back under Moscow’s sway.Mr. Putin has just sent history into reverse. The United States should seek to foil and punish Moscow’s aggression, but Washington also needs to be pragmatic to navigate a world that, even if more unruly, is also irreversibly interdependent.The Gap Between Means and EndsRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed a gap between America’s ideological aspirations and geopolitical realities that has been widening since the 1990s. During the heady decade after the end of the Cold War, Washington was confident that the triumph of American power and purpose cleared the way for the spread of democracy. A primary instrument for doing so was the enlargement of NATO.But from early on, the American foreign policy establishment allowed principle to obscure the geopolitical downsides of NATO enlargement. Yes, NATO membership should be open to all countries that qualify, and all nations should be able to exercise their sovereign right to choose their alignments as they see fit. But geography and geopolitics still matter; major powers, regardless of their ideological bent, don’t like it when other major powers stray into their neighborhoods.It’s true that Moscow’s dismay at the prospect of Ukraine’s membership in NATO most likely is fed in part by nostalgia for the geopolitical heft of the Soviet days, Mr. Putin’s paranoia about a “color revolution” arising in Russia, and mystical delusions about unbreakable civilizational links between Russia and Ukraine. But it is also true that the West erred in dismissing Russia’s legitimate security concerns about NATO setting up shop on the other side of its 1,000-mile-plus border with Ukraine.All major powers desire strategic breathing room — which is precisely why Russia has objected to NATO’s eastern expansion since the end of the Cold War. NATO may be a defensive alliance, but it brings to bear aggregate military power that Russia understandably does not want parked near its territory.Indeed, Moscow’s objections to NATO membership for Ukraine are very much in line with America’s own statecraft, which has long sought to keep other major powers away from its borders.The United States spent much of the 19th century ushering Britain, France, Russia and Spain out of the Western Hemisphere. Thereafter, Washington regularly turned to military intervention to hold sway in the Americas. The exercise of hemispheric hegemony continued during the Cold War, with the United States determined to box the Soviet Union and its ideological sympathizers out of Latin America. When Moscow deployed missiles to Cuba in 1962, the United States issued an ultimatum that brought the superpowers to the brink of war.After Russia recently hinted that it might again deploy its military to Latin America, the State Department spokesman, Ned Price, responded, “If we do see any movement in that direction, we will respond swiftly and decisively.” Given its own track record, Washington should have given greater credence to Moscow’s objections to bringing Ukraine into NATO.NATO’s open door policy has meanwhile encouraged countries in Europe’s east to lean too far over their strategic skis. While the allure of joining the alliance has encouraged aspirants to carry out the democratic reforms needed to qualify for entry, the open door has also prompted prospective members to engage in excessively risky behavior.Not long after NATO in 2008 pledged that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO,” Georgia’s president, Mikheil Saakashvili, launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia with whom the country had been sporadically fighting for years. Russia promptly carved up Georgia, grabbing control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Mr. Saakashvili thought the West had his back, but he miscalculated and overreached.In similar fashion, NATO encouraged Ukraine to beat a path toward the alliance. The 2014 Maidan Revolution toppled a pro-Moscow regime and put Ukraine on a westward course, resulting in Russia’s intervention in Crimea and Donbas. NATO’s open door then beckoned, prompting Ukrainians in 2019 to enshrine their NATO aspirations in the Constitution.Now Russia has again invaded the country to block its westward path. Given its unenviable proximity to Russia, Ukraine would have been better off playing it safe, quietly building a stable democracy while sticking with the neutral status that it embraced when it exited the Soviet Union. Indeed, Ukraine’s potential return to neutrality figures prominently in the talks between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war.NATO has wisely avoided direct involvement in the fighting in Ukraine in order to avert war with Russia. But NATO’s unwillingness to protect Ukraine has exposed a troubling disconnect between the organization’s stated goal of making the country a member and its judgment that defending Ukraine is not worth the cost.In effect, the United States and its allies, even as they impose severe sanctions on Russia and send arms to Ukraine, are revealing that they do not deem the defense of the country to be a vital interest. But if that is the case, then why have NATO members wanted to extend to Ukraine a security guarantee that would obligate them to go to war in its defense?NATO should extend security guarantees to countries that are of intrinsic strategic importance to the United States and its allies, but it should not make countries strategically important by extending them security guarantees. In a world that is rapidly reverting to the Hobbesian logic of power politics, when adversaries may regularly test U.S. commitments, NATO cannot afford to be profligate in handing out such guarantees. Strategic prudence requires distinguishing vital interests from lesser ones and conducting statecraft accordingly.Beginning the World Over AgainAmericans have long understood the purpose of their power to be not only security but also the spread of liberty at home and abroad. As Thomas Paine wrote in 1776, “We have it in our power to begin the world over again.”Paine was surely engaging in hyperbole. But successive generations of Americans have taken the nation’s exceptionalist calling to heart, with quite impressive results. Through the power of its example as well as its many exertions abroad — including World War I, World War II and the Cold War — the United States has succeeded in expanding the footprint of liberal democracy.But the ideological aspirations of the United States have at times fueled overreach, producing outcomes at odds with the nation’s idealist ambitions. The founding generation was determined to build an extended republic that would stretch to the Pacific Coast. The exalted banner of Manifest Destiny provided ideological justification for the nation’s westward expansion — but also moral cover for trampling on Native Americans and launching a war of choice against Mexico that led to U.S. annexation of roughly half of Mexico’s territory.President William McKinley in 1898 embarked on a war to expel colonial Spain from Cuba, insisting that Americans had to act “in the cause of humanity.” Yet victory in the Spanish-American War turned the United States itself into an imperial power as it asserted control over Spanish possessions in the Caribbean and Pacific, including the Philippines. The resulting Filipino insurgency led to the deaths of some 4,000 U.S. troops and more than 200,000 Filipino fighters and civilians.As he prepared the country for entry into World War I, President Woodrow Wilson declared before Congress that “the world must be made safe for democracy.” After U.S. forces helped bring the war to a close, he played a leading role in negotiations over the League of Nations, a global body that was to preserve peace through collective action, dispute resolution and disarmament. But such idealist ambitions proved too much even for Americans. The Senate shot down U.S. membership in the League; Wilson’s ideological overreach cleared the way for the stubborn isolationism of the interwar era.“The Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty,” President George W. Bush proclaimed just before launching the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But the war resulted in far more bloodshed and chaos than liberty. Likewise, two decades of exhaustive U.S. efforts to bring stability and democracy to Afghanistan fell far short, with the American withdrawal last summer giving way to Taliban rule and a humanitarian nightmare. Across these historical episodes, noble ambitions became divorced from strategic realities, yielding dreadful results.Getting RealNATO meant well in opening its doors to Ukraine, yet good intentions have again stumbled on geopolitical realities. To be sure, Mr. Putin had the opportunity to settle his objections to Ukraine’s membership in NATO at the negotiating table. Last June, President Biden admitted that whether Ukraine joins the alliance “remains to be seen”; more recently, President Emmanuel Macron of France floated the idea of “Finlandization” for Ukraine — effective neutrality — and proposals for a formal moratorium on further enlargement circulated. Mr. Putin could have picked up these leads, but he instead opted for war — and now owns the resulting death and destruction.Russia’s relationship with the West is fast heading toward militarized rivalry. In light of the tight strategic partnership that has emerged between Moscow and Beijing — and China’s own geopolitical ambitions — the next Cold War may well pit the West against a Sino-Russian bloc stretching from the Western Pacific to Eastern Europe.The return of a two-bloc world that plays by the rules of realpolitik means that Washington will need to dial back its efforts to expand the liberal order, instead returning to a strategy of patient containment aimed at preserving geopolitical stability and avoiding great-power war. A new strategic conservatism will require avoiding the further extension of defense commitments into geographic areas that Russia and China consider their rimlands.Instead, the United States should seek stable balances of power in the European and Asia-Pacific theaters. Washington will need to strengthen its forward presence in both theaters, requiring higher and smarter military spending and the strict avoidance of demanding wars of choice and nation-building adventures in the Middle East or other peripheral regions.At the same time, taming an interdependent world will require working across ideological lines. Washington should ease off on the promotion of democracy and human rights abroad and the Biden administration should refrain from its tendency to articulate a geopolitical vision that too neatly divides the world into democracies and autocracies. Strategic and economic expedience will at times push the United States to partner with repressive regimes; moderating oil prices, for example, may require collaboration with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.Even though the United States will continue teaming up with its traditional democratic allies in Europe and Asia, many of the world’s democracies will avoid taking sides in a new era of East-West rivalry. Indeed, Brazil, India, Israel, South Africa and other democracies have been sitting on the fence when it comes to responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Russia clearly poses the most immediate threat to geopolitical stability in Eurasia, but China, because of its emergence as a true competitor of the United States, still poses the greater geopolitical challenge in the longer term. Now that Russia and China are regularly teaming up, they could together constitute an opposing bloc far more formidable than its Soviet forebear. Accordingly, the United States should exploit opportunities to put distance between Moscow and Beijing, following the lead of the quintessential realists Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who in the 1970s weakened the Communist bloc by driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union.The United States should play both sides. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marks a fundamental breach with the Atlantic democracies, yet the West cannot afford to completely turn its back on Russia; too much is at stake. As during the Cold War, Washington will need a hybrid strategy of containment and engagement. Russia should remain in the penalty box for now, with the United States pushing back against the Kremlin’s territorial expansionism and other aggressive behavior by reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank and maintaining harsh economic sanctions.But Washington should also remain on the lookout for opportunities to engage with Moscow. Its invasion of Ukraine has just made Russia an economic and strategic dependent of China; Mr. Putin will not relish being Xi Jinping’s sidekick. The United States should exploit the Kremlin’s discomfort with becoming China’s junior partner by signaling that Russia has a Western option.Assuming an eventual peace settlement in Ukraine that permits the scaling back of sanctions, the Western democracies should remain open to cautious and selective cooperation with Moscow. Areas of potential collaboration include furthering nuclear and conventional arms control, sharing best practices and technologies on alternatives to fossil fuels, and jointly developing rules of the road to govern military and economic activity in the Arctic.Russia needs China more than China needs Russia, so Washington should also seek to pull Beijing away from Moscow. Beijing’s ambiguous response to the invasion of Ukraine suggests at least a measure of discomfort with the economic and geopolitical disruption that has been produced by Russian recklessness. Yet Beijing continues to benefit from Russian energy and strategic cooperation and from the fact that Mr. Putin is forcing the United States to focus on Europe, thereby stalling the U.S. “pivot to Asia.” Nonetheless, Washington should keep an eye out for opportunities to work with Beijing in areas of common interest — trade, climate change, North Korea, digital governance, public health — to improve relations, tackle global problems and potentially weaken the bond between China and Russia.As during the Cold War, a world of rival blocs could mean economic as well as geopolitical division. The severe impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia underscores the dark side of globalization, potentially driving home to both the United States and China that economic interdependence entails quite considerable risk. China could distance itself from global markets and financial systems, while Washington could seek to further decouple the United States from Chinese investment, technology, goods and supply chains. The world may be entering a prolonged and costly era of deglobalization.The United States will always be an idealist country struggling to navigate a realist world. That’s as it should be; the globe is a better place for it. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a geopolitical watershed: A more realist world is back, requiring that America’s idealist ambitions yield more regularly to inescapable strategic realities.Charles A.

116,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.More than 10 million Ukrainians have been displaced and more than 4 million have fled the country since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Cities and towns throughout the country continue to be bombarded by Russian artillery. Some are now nearly unrecognizable. Civilians have died, families have been ripped apart and lives have been forever changed.But within the chaos and disruption, reporters have witnessed moments of humanity and resilience: Neighbors helping one another; families reuniting after panic; people organizing aid.Below, Times journalists on the ground in Ukraine and elsewhere share some of the displays of courage and acts of kindness they’ve seen over the course of the conflict.Valerie Hopkins, Moscow correspondent, reporting from Lviv, UkraineI interviewed Eduard Zarubin, a 50-year-old urologist from Mariupol, Ukraine.

There is very little food.For three weeks, before he was able to get out of Mariupol, Mr. Zarubin and his son walked nearly eight miles every day to get clean water. I wrote about Mr. Zarubin’s experience in his home city, which now looks apocalyptic.After I shared the article on Facebook, I noticed a comment written in Russian: “Eduard Zarubin and his family saved me and my wife. In besieged Mariupol, he brought me bread, medicine, and gave me hope for salvation. When we were ready to die, he took us out of the war zone. Now we have not been hiding from Russian planes, shells and missiles for a week now. Sincerely grateful for the rescue.”Mr. Zarubin had not told me any of this in our interview. I was touched that in the worst of conditions, when no one had enough food or water, Mr. Zarubin was still able to provide so much help to those around him. To me, it really demonstrated the triumph of humanity over barbarity, and is indicative of the tremendous solidarity Ukrainians have shown one another.ImageIn Mariupol, Eduard Zarubin trekked daily for water.Credit...via Eduard ZarubinClare Toeniskoetter, senior producer on “The Daily,” reporting from a train station in Przemyśl, PolandI met a young volunteer named Dmitriy at the train station.

118,"IRPIN, Ukraine — Creeping forward block by block, Ukrainian soldiers in a reconnaissance unit on Tuesday found signs of a retreating Russian army everywhere: a charred armored vehicle, abandoned body armor decorated with an orange and black St. George ribbon, a Russian military symbol, and the traditional blue-and-white striped underwear issued to Russian soldiers, cast aside in a forest.What they did not encounter was the Russian army in any organized state. After a month of savage street fighting, one of the most pivotal battles in the war so far ended this week — at least for now — with an improbable victory in Irpin for Ukraine’s outgunned and outnumbered military. By Tuesday, Ukrainian forces had quashed any significant Russian resistance in this strategic outlying town near Kyiv, the capital.Pockets of Russian soldiers remained, posing risks. A firefight erupted in the afternoon when Ukrainian soldiers destroyed a lone Russian armored personnel carrier in an otherwise empty neighborhood, according to a commander.ImageUkrainian soldiers crossing a destroyed Irpin bridge on Tuesday.ImageSome civilians are still fleeing Irpin, the scene of fierce fighting in recent weeks.But Ukraine’s military had essentially recaptured Irpin, a town both strategically and symbolically important as the closest the Russian army had gotten to Kyiv, just three miles away. Its success in driving the Russians away may have factored into the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday, when the two sides achieved what appeared to be their most substantive progress to date.Moscow promised to reduce “by multiples” the intensity of its military activity around Kyiv, an area that includes Irpin, in effect acknowledging that its advance toward the capital had stalled and was at least in some places being pushed back.With superior numbers and weaponry, Russia could always decide to mount another assault on Irpin. And Ukrainian security experts expressed skepticism about Russia’s pledge to pull back. “They will not abandon plans to take the capital,” Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council, said in an interview.ImageThe soldiers paused from their patrols under the Irpin bridge.Still, some people saw the recapture of Irpin as a moral victory, even if street fighting continued in the town and the military gains might be tentative.Kyiv was always the biggest prize of all for the Russian military, as the seat of government and a city ingrained in both Russian and Ukrainian identity. But the Ukrainian military’s performance in the vicious street fighting in an arc of outlying towns and villages became emblematic of the challenges Russian forces would face as they attempted to encircle or capture the capital.“Today we have good news,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a videotaped address on Monday. “Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory.”ImageMembers of the unit passed the square where a family was killed by a Russian mortar shell earlier this month.ImagePassing through a hole in a concrete wall in Irpin.Mr. Zelensky said that the town of Irpin was now “liberated.” He added, “Well done. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result.” He said some fighting continued.In its attempt to capture the capital, the Russian military was bedeviled by logistical setbacks as it advanced in lumbering tank columns into the urban environment of Kyiv’s suburbs, where armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambushes. Over a month of fighting, with Ukraine’s military putting up fierce resistance, the losses piled up.Western and Ukrainian officials have been saying for weeks that the Russians have taken heavy casualties in these suburban battles. That was on display on Tuesday, as the Ukrainian reconnaissance unit pushed into a scene of destruction in a neighborhood of one-story homes in Irpin.ImageDestroyed vehicles in Irpin. The vicious give-and-take of the fighting for nearly a month left a sprawl of burned or blown-up buildings, tank tracks in the roads and bullet cartridges scattered all about.

Many such units are based in central Kyiv, commuting to the war zone by car.ImageA member of the unit advancing through the streets of Irpin.ImageThe soldiers regrouped in a maze of back streets.The reconnaissance unit that patrolled Irpin on Tuesday, a part of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, uses as its base a shuttered bar in Kyiv, now cluttered with sleeping bags, boxes of ammunition and hand grenades.At dawn on a clear, cold morning on Tuesday, the soldiers strapped on body armor and pouches of ammunition, with a crackling noise of Velcro, then jumped in place to ensure their gear was well attached. The bar’s stereo played Ukrainian folk songs.The front in Irpin was a quick drive away.

The patrol encountered only one elderly man, who waved from behind a window of a house.Two hours into their rounds, the Ukrainians were panting and sweating, dashing between walls and into backyards, climbing in and out of broken windows. “They lived in these houses and they were firing on Kyiv from this neighborhood,” Bohdan said of the Russians.The buzz of their drone was nearly always overhead, scouting the street in front of them.ImageA disabled Russian armored vehicle.ImageProminent blue tape on their uniforms allows Ukrainians to recognize each other easily on the battlefield.Through most of the day, there were no sounds of small-arms fire anywhere in town. Such fire would indicate close engagements between the two armies. The soldiers passed a Russian military identification document, fluttering in the wind on the lawn of a house, but did not touch it to check the name, fearing a booby trap.Irpin has loomed large symbolically in the war not just because of its adjacency to the capital. In normal times, it was a town that conveyed nothing so much as the ordinariness and tranquillity of a middle-class suburban life in Kyiv, with parks for bike riding and tree-lined streets. But the fighting grew fiercer as Russia moved to encircle the capital, and the death of a mother and her two children fleeing the city early in the conflict — struck by a mortar as they crossed a bridge — came to represent the shattered sense of security in once-safe communities.ImageA stray dog accompanied the soldiers on part of the patrol.In a town park, the Ukrainian patrol found a destroyed Russian armored personnel carrier, burned in places to a rich orange color. Beside the vehicle were the traditional blue-and-white undershirts used by Russian soldiers, called telnyashkas. Elsewhere, they found a cardboard box labeled Russian army food. “Individual Food Ration,” the label said. “Not for Sale.”The soldiers took selfies beside the incinerated armored personnel carrier. Some sank to the pine duff to rest, gazing at the spectacle of the destroyed vehicle where Russian soldiers had died. The bodies had been retrieved earlier, though by whom was unclear.“I don’t see the Russians as enemies,” said a Ukrainian soldier who offered only his first name, Hennady, out of concern for his safety. “They are just inert people, doing things without knowing what they are doing.”ImageA backyard badly damaged by shelling.ImageMoving through a wooded area in Irpin.The day had been quiet but suddenly shifted with a cacophony of heavy machine gun fire and explosions from rocket-propelled grenades as the squad led by Bohdan, which had remained behind, encountered a Russian armored personnel carrier.

Later, a commander said the vehicle was destroyed.Serhiy, one of the soldiers, offered a more skeptical assessment of Ukrainian gains in Irpin. While perhaps the largest occupied town was now recaptured, he said, Ukraine’s control was uncertain. “We have a tentative frontline” now outside Irpin, he said, “but the key word is tentative.”“Their goal is Kyiv,” he added. “They will come back. They will need to cover this ground again.”ImageUkrainian soldiers with a disabled Russian armored vehicle.Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/ukraine-russia-kyiv-irpin.html
119,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces are still in full control of the Azovstal steel plant in the war-battered port city of Mariupol and have repelled continuous assaults by Russian infantry even while weathering steadily intensifying air and artillery attacks, a commander of one of the Ukrainian units defending the plant said in an interview on Sunday.Ukrainian forces are willing to leave the factory and evacuate the city if given guarantees of safe passage for themselves and hundreds of civilians, said Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Battalion, whose fighters have been holed up at the plant since March 1.“We are prepared to leave the city because there is nothing left to defend,” Captain Palamar said by phone from inside the plant. “We consider that we’ve fulfilled our mission. But we will continue to defend it until there is an order to retreat from our military leadership. And if we are going to leave, we are going to leave with our weapons.”On Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia issued an order to halt the assault of the Azovstal factory. He called for a blockade instead, but the fighting continued, drawing crucial resources from Russian forces, even as preparations were underway for a significant offensive in eastern Ukraine.“Despite the fact that today is an important Christian holiday, they bombed the factory all night,” Captain Palamar said.The defense of the Azovstal factory in Mariupol is emblematic of the fierce, and to many unexpected, resistance of Ukrainian forces against their more powerful and more numerous adversaries. For nearly two months, a relatively small band of fighters has withstood a relentless barrage of attacks from land, sea and air, continuing to maintain a defensive perimeter that has prevented Russian troops from entering the territory of the plant, according to soldiers and officials.But Captain Palamar and other soldiers interviewed by The Times said that they are short on time. Stocks of ammunition are dwindling and, perhaps more critically, rations of food and water are running dangerously low. It is not clear how many people remain inside the plant — a sprawling complex consisting of a number of buildings with deep reinforced concrete bunkers that have been difficult for Russian forces to penetrate.What is certain is that no one is coming for them. The rings of Russian defenses around the city are too heavily fortified for Ukrainian forces to mount an attack. Ukrainian fighters at the plant say that they hope some neutral country might work to broker a deal that could allow them and the civilians sheltering in the plant to escape, perhaps by sea. On Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said he had discussed with his soldiers the impossibility of Ukraine’s military swiftly breaking through to their position by attacking from outside the Russian encirclement. There would be no immediate rescue.“We are not preparing it at this moment,” he told the reporters gathered in the Maidan Nezalezhnosti subway station in Kyiv, the capital. “They clearly understand this. That is the reality.”In the interview, Captain Palamar indicated that the Ukrainian fighters at the plant were not satisfied with efforts being made to extract them. He called on the military and political leadership of Ukraine “to save the lives of our fighters, who have done so much for this war, who have died heroically, been wounded and held practically the entire southeastern military group.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We can’t get out ourselves. Not without help,” he said.Captain Palamar would not say how many fighters remain alive and in fighting condition, but admitted that more than 500 were wounded, some seriously. The conditions, particularly for the wounded, are grim. There is a field hospital, but very little medical equipment or medicine remains. Video from inside the hospital that he sent via WhatsApp shows pale, largely motionless soldiers with an array of gruesome injuries sprawled on mats on a concrete floor. Anesthesia drugs are running low and some of the wounded require amputations, Captain Palamar said. Every day brings new fighting and death, he and others at the plant said. The battle for Azovstal is being waged along a defensive ring on the outer rim of the factory complex, though heavy bombing has slowly reduced the areas from which Ukrainian soldiers can carry out the fight. As Russian forces have used increasingly large and powerful weapons, cave-ins have become a more common cause of death, he said, both to civilians and soldiers. Fighting at the plant is being waged by a number of Ukrainian groups including national guard units, regular army, volunteer battalions and even some police officers. But the primary fighting force is the Azov Battalion, which is part of the National Guard of Ukraine. It is a force that does include nationalist soldiers, which the Kremlin has used to paint the unit as fascist. The unit has evolved into a regular combat force within the Ukrainian military.Captain Palamar and others have ruled out surrender to Russian forces, saying they do not trust the Kremlin’s guarantees that it would abide by rules governing the treatment of prisoners of war. “No one wants to surrender and end up in the hands of the Nazis or the Gestapo,” he said. “There are many examples of soldiers ending up as prisoners and contact with them is lost. Their fates are unknown.” Maria Varenikova and Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kyiv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/ukrainian-forces-mariupol-steel-plant.html
120,"Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.WARSAW — After the White House announced this week that President Biden would visit Poland, the Kremlin let rip with a belligerent tirade: Polish leaders were a “vassal” of the United States, gripped by “pathological Russophobia,” and their country a “community of political imbeciles.”Instead of fearful jitters, however, the broadside by Dmitri A. Medvedev, deputy head of the Kremlin’s security council, stirred a burst of pride in Warsaw.“This is further proof that the Russians treat Poland seriously and see its growing importance in the West,” said Stanislaw Zaryn, director of the Department of National Security and spokesman for the coordinating minister for security.Russia’s rage and President Biden’s decision to make Poland his only European stop on Friday and Saturday after summit meetings in Belgium reflect a new reality created by the war in Ukraine: Poland is suddenly the pivot around which many of the West’s hopes and Russia’s fury turn.Shaking off, or at least obscuring, its reputation as Europe’s inveterate troublemaker, Poland’s right-wing populist government has now taken center stage, embraced by both Brussels and the United States as a linchpin of Western solidarity and security. It shows no sign of retreating from its many fights with the European Union, but Poland, which has also quarreled with Washington, has repositioned itself as an indispensable and a trusted ally.ImagePresident Biden at a news conference following meetings with other leaders from the Group of 7 at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times“Poland is the center of gravity. Just look at the map,” said Jacek Bartosiak, founder of Strategy and Future, a Warsaw research group. “Without Poland there is no NATO eastern flank.”To fortify that flank, the Pentagon has sent more than 5,000 additional troops and Patriot surface-to-air missile batteries to Poland, more than doubling the number of U.S. military personnel in the country.On Wednesday, Poland said it had identified 45 Russian diplomats as spies, all of whom had been ordered to leave the country. The deputy foreign minister, Pawel Jablonski, said Poland could not tolerate Russia’s abuse of its embassy in Warsaw when Moscow “is waging a barbaric war against Ukraine.” Spies disguised as diplomats, he added, not only “pose a threat to Poland’s security, but also to the security of Ukrainian citizens staying in Poland. Hence this decision.”Previously scolded by Brussels for its hostility to migrants, Poland has over the past month welcomed more than two million refugees fleeing the war next door in Ukraine, far more than any other country. It has also become a vital staging post for the supply of weapons, ammunition, fuel and other assistance to Kyiv and put itself at the center of deliberations shaping the West’s response to the crisis.Warsaw has become the capital through which all diplomatic, military and humanitarian roads to Ukraine now pass.ImageThe leader of Poland's governing Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, left, and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, in Kyiv last week.Credit...Andrzej Lange/EPA, via ShutterstockAnd the Polish government, which earlier infuriated Washington by pushing through legislation, later vetoed by the president, that threatened an American-owned television network, is basking in the glow of appreciative attention. In recent weeks, it has received visits and praise from Vice President Kamala Harris; the head of the C.I.A., William Burns; Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; the president of the European Council, Charles Michel; and a host of other senior U.S. and European officials.Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, on Tuesday described Poland as a “frontline and very vulnerable ally” that “has taken the brunt of the humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine.” Poland’s sudden prominence as NATO’s most exposed frontline state has stirred alarm that it could be sucked into the conflict, particularly after Russian missiles last week obliterated a Ukrainian military base near the border. Among those most worried are some of the Ukrainians who fled to escape fighting at home.“Poland is too close. I want to get out of here,” said Yevgeny Pyskuko, a music teacher who fled to Poland after Russian forces attacked a huge nuclear power station near his home in southeastern Ukraine. “I want to go across the ocean. It is not safe here,” he added.ImageVice President Kamala Harris during her meeting with Polish and American soldiers at a base in Warsaw, earlier this month.Credit...Leszek Szymanski/EPA, via ShutterstockDespite the possible risks, Poland has been in the forefront of rallying Europe to take tough measures to punish President Vladimir V.

Poland was already one of only 10 countries in the 30-member NATO alliance that met a minimum spending target of 2 percent.ImageVolunteers gather supplies to send to Ukraine in Lublin, Poland, on Sunday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesPolish foreign policy, preoccupied until the war in Ukraine with efforts to form a bloc of like-minded conservative and often pro-Kremlin European populists who share its hostility to Brussels, is now working to cement a new bloc of European countries pushing for tougher sanctions against Russia, including the Baltic states and the Czech Republic.At a meeting of European foreign ministers this week in Brussels, Poland joined Lithuania and other countries on Europe’s eastern fringe that have a long and painful experience of Russian aggression in lobbying hard for a ban on oil imports from Russia. The effort failed in face of strong opposition from Germany, the Netherlands and others, but it put Warsaw at the center of an emerging bloc of nations determined to punish Mr. Putin for invading Ukraine.It has also sundered Poland’s close partnership with Hungary, which opposes further sanctions and whose proudly illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orban, shares the Polish governing party’s view on Brussels but has a long record of cozying up to the Kremlin.Sophie Pornschlegel, a senior policy analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Center, said the Polish government was using the crisis for its own benefit. Despite Poland making no real changes to policies that put it on a collision course with Brussels, she said, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is likely to be “rather lenient due to Poland’s position welcoming so many refugees.”Poland’s shift, and particularly its welcoming of refugees, has been greeted warmly by many in the European Union.In early March, Mr. Michel, the president of the European Council, a powerful body that ultimately decides the bloc’s direction but that has frequently struggled to find unity because of Poland and Hungary, visited Rzeszow, a Polish city near the border with Ukraine, along with the Polish prime minister.“I would like to commend you, dear Prime Minister Mateusz, your team, and the Polish people,” Mr. Michel gushed.ImageA mural supporting Ukraine, in downtown Warsaw on Sunday.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York TimesMonika Pronczuk contributed reporting from Brussels.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/world/europe/poland-ukraine-russia.html
121,"SDE BOKER, Israel — When he joins a summit on Sunday focused on Middle East unity, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will ask some of the region’s top diplomats to rally behind another cause: helping Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion.The hastily arranged summit meeting in the Negev desert has been billed as a historic event, designed to showcase growing diplomatic and economic ties between some Arab states and Israel that Mr. Blinken on Sunday called “unthinkable just a few years ago.” But foremost on his mind was the modest support for Ukraine among countries in the region that also have ties with Russia.“This is very much a part of the conversation we’ve had today, and I’ll be having throughout the course of my visit here, including with our partners,” Mr. Blinken said Sunday in Jerusalem during a news conference with Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid.“We will be talking throughout about various means of support that Israel and other countries can give to Ukraine,” he said. “That will be a conversation that’s ongoing throughout this trip.”Mr. Blinken praised Israel’s humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including by assisting refugees and sending a field hospital to the conflict zone. Mr. Blinken also noted Israel’s role in trying to negotiate with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — one of the few countries still able to do so — to end the crisis even as it has condemned the invasion.But so far, Israel has not sent weapons to Ukraine, nor joined a broad coalition of countries worldwide, including the seven largest industrial nations, in imposing harsh economic sanctions designed to isolate Russia and hamper its war footing.ImageAn Israeli field hospital in Mostyska, western Ukraine, near the Polish border.

Israel also coordinates with Russia to prevent coming into direct but unintentional military conflict in neighboring Syria, where Iranian soldiers or their proxy fighters seek to threaten the Jewish state.Mr. Lapid called relations between the United States and Israel “unbreakable” but noted disagreements over the Biden administration’s attempts to return to a nuclear deal with Iran and open a diplomatic consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem. While Israel has not imposed sanctions against Russia, it is working to prevent Moscow from evading the economic penalties, Mr. Blinken said.Mr. Lapid said, “I think there is no doubt in anyone’s mind, while our team was presenting this to the American delegation, that Israel is doing everything it can in order to be part of the effort.”In trying to maintain relations with Russia against the backdrop of war, Israel is not alone in the Middle East.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Russia exports even more goods to Morocco than to Israel, amounting to about $1.35 billion in coal, petroleum and chemicals in 2020.

He noted “good relations” with Ukraine as well and defended Morocco’s neutrality in the war as “positive.”“The idea is to not aggravate the situation,” Mr. Faouzi said. “It is necessary for other countries to find common grounds. Full-fledged war benefits nobody.”Mr. Blinken will travel to Morocco later this week, his first visit there as secretary of state. While there, he is also expected to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, which refused late last month to denounce Russia’s invasion by abstaining from an American-backed resolution at the United Nations Security Council.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.The Persian Gulf nation also has sidestepped U.S. requests to increase oil production for European markets that had relied on Russian energy. The Emirates buys military weapons from Moscow and has given haven to Russian oligarchs and others closely linked to Mr. Putin who have relocated to Dubai to escape the international sanctions’ bite.The disconnect over Russia represents the latest sign of frayed relations between Washington and the Emirates that began cooling when President Biden made clear that the Middle East would not be a top foreign policy priority for his administration. It has sought instead to focus on the United States’ complex relations with China and, more recently, on deterring Russia.This month, the Emirati ambassador to Washington described a “stress test” underway between the U.A.E. and the United States, caused in part by the Biden administration’s renewed negotiations for a nuclear deal with Iran and by a dispute over a $23 billion arms sale that would have sent advanced American warplanes to the U.A.E. The ambassador, Yousef al-Otaiba, described “strong days where the relationship is very healthy, and days where the relationship is under question.”ImageA bread factory in Al Hasakah, Syria, last month.

The energy-rich kingdom voted in favor of the Security Council resolution that denounced the invasion. But it is also continuing to talk to Russia in hopes of finding a way out of the war, including in a phone call between Mr. Putin and King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa two weeks ago.An analysis published this month by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy noted that Russia’s invasion could have broad economic impacts on the region, from demands to export more oil and gas to Europe, to possible shortages on wheat and other products from Ukraine. It concluded that much of the Middle East “may be caught in the middle as the conflict in Ukraine unfolds.”“Further fallout could increase instability in the region and beyond,” the analysis concluded. “Amid broad concerns about Washington decreasing its focus on the Middle East, the U.S. response to the Ukraine crisis could shape perceptions about American interests in the region.”In Jerusalem, Mr. Blinken acknowledged rising bread prices in the Middle East, caused by the wheat shortages, in describing the war’s fallout as “hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest.”He said his travels this week, including to Algiers, Algeria and Ramallah in the West Bank, would look “to alleviate some of the burden that this is placing on people, including throughout the Middle East.”Patrick Kingsley contributed reporting from Sde Boker, Israel, and Aida Alami from Paris.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/world/middleeast/blinken-mideast-ukraine.html
122,"The American conductor Gavriel Heine has been a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years. He has led hundreds of performances of classics like “Swan Lake” and “The Rite of Spring.” And he has done so as a protégé of the company’s leader: Valery Gergiev.On Saturday, Mr. Heine went yet again to the Mariinsky, but not for an evening at the podium. He was there to inform Mr. Gergiev — a longtime friend and supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — that he was resigning from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. Mr. Heine gathered his possessions, including a few white bow ties and scores for “La Bohème” and “The Turn of the Screw,” and prepared to leave the country.Mr. Heine, 47, had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “There’s no way I could ever be in denial of what is happening in Ukraine,” he said during a series of interviews over the past week. “Russia is not a place where I want to raise my son. It’s not a place where I want my wife to be anymore. It’s not a place I want to be anymore.”His resignation comes as the war continues to upend performing arts. Cultural institutions in Europe and North America, vowing not to hire performers who support Mr. Putin, have severed ties with some artists — most notably Mr. Gergiev — as well as orchestras, theaters and ballet companies. Many artists, citing the invasion, have canceled appearances in Russia.Mr. Gergiev, the theater’s general and artistic director, was once one of the world’s busiest conductors, but his international career has crumbled. Carnegie Hall, for example, canceled a pair of concerts of the Mariinsky Orchestra under his baton that had been planned for May, after he had been dropped from a series of Vienna Philharmonic performances in February. He has returned in recent weeks to St. Petersburg to focus on that company and his domestic cultural empire, which encompasses several stages, thousands of employees and tens of millions of dollars in state financing.ImageValery Gergiev, a mentor of Mr. Heine’s and a longtime friend and supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesMr. Heine found Mr. Gergiev at the Mariinsky on Saturday, where he was leading rehearsals and performances of Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung” and Verdi’s “Attila.” He described repeatedly trying to catch his mentor backstage to inform him of his resignation, finally cornering him in an elevator.It was a quick conversation: five minutes while Mr. Gergiev was rushing to a meeting. Mr. Heine said that Mr. Gergiev seemed surprised but accepted his decision.“He was very nice to me,” Mr. Heine said. “He gave me a handshake and a hug and wished me well. And of course I thanked him for giving me such a huge chance pretty early in my career.”The two conductors also spoke about recent tensions between Russia and the West. Mr. Gergiev — who was fired from engagements in the United States and Europe, as well as from the podium of the Munich Philharmonic, over his refusal to publicly condemn the war — defended his decision, saying that he was not a child, Mr. Heine recalled.The Mariinsky declined to comment on Monday, and said it could not yet confirm Mr. Heine’s resignation. However, the company removed Mr. Heine’s biography from its website Monday evening.Mr. Heine’s departure from the Mariinsky is an unexpected conclusion to his three-decade career in Russia, where he studied with renowned teachers and rose to become a conductor at one of the country’s most prestigious houses. And his exit is another blow to Russian cultural institutions, which are grappling with boycotts and cancellations by foreign groups as the country’s arts increasingly turn inward under Mr. Putin. Mr. Gergiev remains a critical figure in Mr. Putin’s campaign. Mr. Putin, during a televised meeting last month, asked Mr. Gergiev whether he was interested in the idea of uniting the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow with the Mariinsky, an arrangement that would take Russia back to the days of the czars.“Russia is just going to be more and more closed,” said Simon Morrison, a music professor at Princeton University. “It’s going to revert more and more to its own true self, harsh as that might seem — a sealed-off, angry, paranoid and resentful feudal realm.”Mr. Heine, who grew up in Cherry Hill, N.J., became interested in Russian culture as a teenager. He accompanied his mother, a pianist, to a performance in Moscow, and while there took cello lessons with a professor at the Moscow Conservatory.After high school, he returned to Russia for language and cultural studies. In 1998, he became one of the Moscow Conservatory’s first American graduates, then began to study with the eminent Russian conductor Ilya Musin, who also taught Mr. Gergiev.ImageMr. Heine leading the Mariinsky’s orchestra in 2017.Credit...Irina TumineneHis break came in 2007, when Mr. Heine approached Mr. Gergiev during a rehearsal in Philadelphia and asked him whether the Mariinsky had any openings. Mr. Heine was invited to make his debut at the theater later that year with Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro,” and soon began to lead performances there regularly. In 2009, he was named a resident conductor.During his time at the Mariinsky, Mr. Heine was at the podium for over 850 performances and watched as the company grew in power and size under Mr. Gergiev. The arts and the state, Mr. Heine said he came to understand, were inexorably linked in Russia. He was in the theater on two occasions when Mr. Putin, the house’s main benefactor, appeared for awards ceremonies and other events.“I just assumed that culture is a priority for this government, for whatever reason,” he said. “And they feel very strongly about it, and that’s the relationship.”How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine. The American conductor, a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years, has resigned from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov. Ukraine’s best-known living composer, Mr. Silvestrov made his way from his home in Kyiv to Berlin, where he is now sheltering. In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko. The superstar Russian soprano faced backlash in Russia after she tried to distance herself from President Vladimir V. Putin with a statement condemning the war. She had previously lost work in the West because of her past support for Mr. Putin.Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.He recognized that Mr. Gergiev sometimes used art for political purposes, such as when he led a patriotic concert in the Syrian city of Palmyra in 2016, shortly after Russian airstrikes helped drive the Islamic State out of the city.Still, Mr. Heine said, he was not bothered by Mr. Gergiev’s long association with Mr. Putin. The two have known each other since the early 1990s, when Mr. Putin was an official in St. Petersburg and Mr. Gergiev was beginning his tenure at the Mariinsky, which was then called the Kirov Theater.“I never felt that we were at the service of the state,” Mr. Heine said. “It just seemed like the state trusted Gergiev for his artistic priorities, and he convinced them that his priorities were good priorities, and they funded that.”ImageMr. Heine, center, with the Kharkiv Symphony Orchestra, where he was the chief conductor from 2003 to 2007.Credit...via Semantix Creative GroupThe invasion of Ukraine changed his views on Russia and his place in it. He had a personal connection to Ukraine, having served as chief conductor of the Kharkiv Symphony Orchestra there from 2003 to 2007. When he saw images of Russian missiles hitting a building in Kharkiv in early March, he was distraught.“That broke me,” he said. “I saw the faces of all of the musicians that I had worked with. I thought of my orchestra director who lives two blocks behind that building. I mean, that’s his neighborhood. I just lost it. I couldn’t do anything that day and I thought that was pretty much it.”He resolved to leave his position, in part because he was worried about the safety of his wife and 11-year-old son. His family left for the United States in early March, while he went to Switzerland to lead a production of Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin” at the Opéra de Lausanne.He returned to St. Petersburg last week and spent several days packing up his apartment and saying goodbye to colleagues over meals at his favorite Italian restaurant near the Mariinsky, where a pizza is named for him. He submitted his resignation letter to the company on Sunday and returned the keys to his locker.On Monday, he arrived in London, where he is set to lead a production of “Swan Lake” at the Royal Opera House next month.He said it was hard for him to leave Russia, where he has spent about half of his life. He considers himself Russian from a cultural perspective, though he remains an American citizen.Still, Mr. Heine has made his peace with moving on. “The sad part wasn’t walking into the theater; the sad part was the disappointment and the sadness of the people that I had to tell I was leaving,” he said.“The theater’s not going anywhere,” he added. “I am.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/arts/music/gavriel-heine-resigns-mariinsky.html

124,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Maps have played a critical role in The New York Times’s coverage of the war in Ukraine — and nearly every graphics journalist at the organization, from New York to Seoul to London, has helped with the mapping effort.The maps give Times readers a clear and accurate depiction of movements in Ukraine. They display the Russian military’s advances and Ukrainian counterattacks; they show recent fighting and destruction in Ukrainian cities.But mapping a war is complicated, said Josh Keller, a deputy international editor who works on visual projects. False information proliferates and governments lie. Misleading imagery spreads on social media. Assessing what is true and what can be mapped, he added, is a complex task.So, before representing anything in maps, The Times confirms news, such as troop positions or new rocket attacks, by corroborating reports from various sources. This includes working with Times journalists on the ground in Ukraine and members of The Times’s Visual Investigations team, which verifies incidents with satellite imagery and video. The Graphics team also scrutinizes statements released by the Russian and Ukrainian militaries. If they can be verified, eyewitness accounts, often posted on social media, also help confirm details.Military analysts, including from organizations such as the Institute for the Study of War and Rochan Consulting, have also been important sources.“There is no perfect information in a war. We seek to independently understand the nature of the fighting and draw the clearest picture we can,” Mr. Keller said.For example, a series of maps published last week depicted the Russian siege on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. The maps reported Russian encroachment on Ukrainian troops over the course of a month. What they did not report were claims by the Russian military that its troops had taken full control of the port area. Josh Holder, a graphics editor based in London, scoured Twitter and Telegram for posts showing large-scale fighting near the port that he could geolocate. He couldn’t find any. Mr. Holder and Marc Santora, an international editor who has been covering the war, doubted the veracity of the Russian military.On Tuesday, the team published a map of the area around the Azovstal steel plant, the last stronghold for Ukrainian troops in the city. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008310557"");

Areas of Russian advances indicate where Russian troops were seen.By Scott ReinhardOnce information is verified, the challenge is mapping the situation accurately without overloading readers, many of whom are looking at the maps on their phones.“The goal is: Look at this map and you can have a quick idea of what’s going on,” said Scott Reinhard, an editor on the Graphics desk.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 24, 2022, 7:42 a.m. ETEaster services at a battered church offer reminders of recent traumas.How ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder became Putin’s man in Germany.The Red Cross says it is ‘deeply alarmed’ by conditions in Mariupol, as Russia continues to bombard.Mr. Reinhard began working on the project after Russia started to build up its presence near Ukraine. First, the team created base maps of Ukraine and its borders, which are informed by geographic data with waterways and population centers. Graphics editors then entered that data into a cartography program; to add The Times’s annotations, the map is also put through a graphics software.Throughout the conflict, Mr. Reinhard and his colleagues have continued to develop the project’s symbology, the markings and icons that communicate new information to readers. For example, arrows show troop movement, and dotted arrows display where Russia might push in the future. Shellings are marked by icons that resemble explosions. Each map is accompanied by a corresponding key to help readers understand what they’re seeing.The goal is to create clarity and avoid clutter, to “take this complexity and put it into some kind of digestible form” for readers, Mr. Reinhard said. As the war has changed, so have the maps. At the outset of the invasion, as the Russian military poured into Ukraine, its gains were a key aspect of war reporting and the biggest piece of information available to journalists. Russian-controlled areas were shaded in a deep red color with blurred edges.But in early March, it became clear the war would not be a ground sweep, and there was more information, like Ukrainian lines of resistance, to convey. So, the team started marking Russia’s territorial holdings in a softer pink color.“We’ve taken some of the weight off the control areas,” Mr. Reinhard said, adding that in some instances editors “still find them helpful visually in telling the story.”As the war has slowed into a grinding conflict, the Graphics desk is now publishing about one new report a week. The team will continue to watch as Russia sharpens its focus on the east — and will continue to show readers movements inside Ukraine.Tim Wallace contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/insider/how-the-times-has-mapped-the-war-in-ukraine.html

126,"BORODYANKA, Ukraine — Andreiy Ziuzko stood near the flattened apartment complex in Borodyanka that was once his home, his belongings in plastic bags on the sidewalk beside a few blackened cooking pots on Tuesday.The building had lain in ruins for weeks, struck just after fighting had driven him and his family to flee. It was only after a while that he explained something even worse had happened. His mother lived a few doors down, and her apartment had also been bombed.“Mom’s home was hit on the same day,” Mr. Ziuzko said. “I can’t find her.”Russian troops recently withdrew from the area around Borodyanka, a Ukrainian commuter town near Kyiv, the capital, that was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes after the invasion. Now, dozens of people who were sheltering in basements or apartments are missing and presumed dead under the rubble, the acting mayor said Tuesday.“We think over 200 people died,” said Georgii Yerko, the acting mayor of Borodyanka. “But it is an assumption.”ImagePeople crowding around a pick up truck distributing aid in Borodyanka.On Tuesday, New York Times journalists reached the town for the first time after Russian troops withdrew. The scars left behind were shocking, with great gashes sliced through multistory complexes along the main street. Four apartment buildings had collapsed in the bombing, residents said, their floors crushed down to ground level like concertinas. Heavy fighting left more destruction for two miles along the main street.Russia’s pullout from areas around Kyiv in recent days has unveiled evidence of abuses that have galvanized the world’s attention. In places like Bucha, a closer-in suburb of the capital just a few miles from Borodyanka, the focus has been on evidence that Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces, including bodies whose hands had been bound and who had been shot at close range.In Borodyanka, and other places, the focus has been on evidence that civilian buildings were indiscriminately targeted. The topic was central in discussions at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday.ImageA man salvaging what he could from his garage.Rosemary DiCarlo, the U.N. chief for political and peace-building affairs, told the Security Council that explosive weapons had caused death and destruction in many populated areas, wrecking infrastructure that included residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems.The U.N. received credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions — banned weapons that spew small explosive mines across a wide space — in populated areas at least 24 times, Ms. DiCarlo said. She added that there were accusations that Ukrainian forces had also used cluster munitions.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.“Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” Ms. DiCarlo told the council.Borodyanka used to have about 13,000 residents, and the town — a simple, modest place, as one resident described it — was built along a highway crossroads. That convergence was a selling point for people who worked in Kyiv, just a short drive away to the southeast, and for Russian troops as well as their convoys that began piling into the country’s north to try to seal off the capital in the last days of February.ImageBorodyanka was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes after the invasion.Residents said that the Russian forces began filing through the town around Feb. 27, and that volunteers with the Ukrainian territorial defense forces then attacked one of the convoys. After that, Russian soldiers started shooting at cars and buildings as they drove through town, said Valerii Vishnyak, a resident. “It was just lawlessness,” he said.Then, late on March 1, Russian jets came screaming overhead. “We were sitting in the cellar,” said Tamara Vishnyak, Mr. Vishnyak’s mother. “The plane flew very low. I counted three seconds and the bomb fell.” The bomb crashed through the building across the street.Mr. Ziuzko, 43, said that the only reason he and his family escaped the airstrikes was because they had fled their nearby building when the fighting set it on fire.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.He said he did not know where his mother, Svetlana Ziuzko, 66, had been at the time the bombs hit, whether in her apartment or in the bomb shelter. His voice catching, he said he could not remember what day it was the last time he saw her.“The back of the building is gone; just the balcony is there,” he said, pointing to the sixth-floor balcony hanging above a vacuum.Behind the building, two women stood watch while their husbands climbed down into the basement next to the destroyed section. Tanya Hachnikova, 36, said her husband was trying to find his parents, who lived in the apartment building. The second woman, Oksana Dikan, 43, was looking for a colleague who lived there and was also missing.ImageTanya Hachnikova, 36, and Oksana Dikan, 43, waited while their husbands tried to find a way into the basement of a destroyed building where Ms. Hachnikova’s in-laws, along with more than 20 other people, had been living when Russian forces hit their building with a missile.They said they thought up to 20 people had been living in the building when it was hit, but the two men climbed back out saying they could not get through to the basement that lay under the rubble. “We need help, and we need equipment,” Ms. Dikan said later by telephone.Many people fled the town to escape the fighting that raged there for days, until a sustained Ukrainian counterattack led Russian troops to pull out last week. Mr. Yerko, the acting mayor, said that digging for bodies would have to wait. The first task, he said, was to reconnect the electricity and remove unexploded ordinance and then clear the rubble.Yaroslav, an information technology specialist who asked that only his first name be published to avoid being identified, was climbing on to a bench to look into a gutted apartment he said belonged to his parents. They had left, with just their documents and their cat, the day before the bomb fell on the building, he said. Almost certainly there were people still living in their apartments and hiding in the shelter when the airstrike hit, he said.Asked if the Ukrainian military had been using the building, he said no. “What army? My parents were living there.”Ivor Prickett contributed reporting from Borodyanka, Ukraine, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/asia/ukraine-civilians-russia-borodyanka.html
127,"LITTLE PLUMPTON, England — There’s not much left of Britain’s only operable fracking site, which was mothballed in 2019 when it caused earth tremors so strong that they were felt miles away.A flare stack for burning off methane gas rises above the green security fence, but the drilling rig is gone and the plan was to pour concrete down the wells, consigning Britain’s experiment with shale gas extraction to history.But with war ravaging Ukraine and disrupting the global energy supply, Britain’s fracking industry has won an 11th-hour reprieve.Workers were expected to start sealing the two wells this month, but — to the alarm of local campaigners — the energy firm, Cuadrilla, is instead discussing with regulators an extension to its license.ImageThe town of Kirkham lies a few miles away from the drilling site. Nearby areas were affected by tremors from the many small earthquakes produced by the fracking process.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York Times“It’s frustrating, because they were so close to actually capping the wells,” said Susan Holliday, who lives a few hundred meters from the site in Lancashire, in northwestern England. She has opposed fracking for eight years and had thought that victory was within her grasp.“If it had been a month earlier, it would have been too late, they would have done it,” she said.Yet following the Russian invasion of Ukraine Europe is scrambling for new energy supplies as it tries to wean itself off imports from Russia, and Germany on Wednesday took the first step toward an emergency plan that could eventually lead to gas rationing. In Britain around 30 lawmakers from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s governing Conservative Party have appealed to him to end a moratorium on fracking, and the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng recently conceded that, at this moment, “it didn’t necessarily make any sense to concrete over the wells.”Enthusiasts who go further include Andy Mayer, energy analyst at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free-market think tank, who argues that “capping these wells now is like dynamiting a gold mine in a gold rush.”The push to save hydraulic fracking — which creates fractures in rock formations to release the natural gas trapped inside — is part of a wider assessment of energy policy in the light of a global crisis that has also put pressure on companies to extract more of Britain’s dwindling North Sea energy resources.Image“It’s frustrating, because they were so close to actually capping the wells,” said Susan Holliday, who lives a few hundred meters from the Little Plumpton fracking site.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesLess than six months after Mr. Johnson hosted the COP26 climate summit, politicians are beginning to challenge the country’s decarbonization strategy amid soaring energy costs for consumers.Domestic gas and electricity bills could triple this year — alongside a wider squeeze on living standards — and Nigel Farage, the veteran pro-Brexit campaigner, has called for a referendum on scrapping the government’s plan to meet a net-zero target for carbon emissions by 2050.According to the British government, in 2020, 41.9 percent of energy consumed was from gas, 31.2 percent from oil and 3.4 percent from coal.Britain imports relatively little energy from Russia (and plans to phase out all purchases of oil this year).But the global price spike is affecting all countries that rely to some extent on imported oil and gas, and in Britain it is causing a reassessment of the government’s energy policy. Even before the war in Ukraine, a rise in costs had driven 30 British power companies, most on the smaller side, out of business.Against this backdrop, Mr. Johnson plans to outline a new energy security strategy soon that is expected to call for more renewable and nuclear power.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Given his political vulnerability after a scandal over Downing Street parties that violated pandemic lockdown rules, Mr. Johnson is likely to at least keep open the door for fracking, which has the support of a hard-line caucus within his own party that could make trouble for him.ImageProtesters in Lancashire have long opposed shale gas extraction in the area. The moratorium on fracking has been in place since the Little Plumpton site caused a 2.9-magnitude earthquake three years ago.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesThis month, one energy minister, Greg Hands, said that “shale gas and new approaches could be part of our future energy mix” as the country transitions to green energy, while adding that “scientific evidence and local support was vital.”Proponents of fracking include Jacob Rees-Mogg, a senior minister, and David Frost, Mr. Johnson’s former cabinet colleague. They express hope that Britain can replicate the experience of the United States, which became an energy exporter largely because of shale.In a statement, Francis Egan, Cuadrilla’s chief executive, expressed frustration that the government, despite its rhetoric, had not yet given clear instructions to its energy regulator to allow fracking to proceed. He appealed to ministers to “ensure that companies like Cuadrilla and others aren’t forced to suffer the risk and financial cost of operating in a position where a government can keep changing its mind and require wells to be cemented whilst they are eminently useful.”The moratorium on fracking has been in place since the Lancashire site caused an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.9 three years ago, prompting the government to say that, before continuing, Cuadrilla must show that shale could be extracted safely.Critics doubt it can do so, but the rewards for gaining a green light could be high. According to one report, the central estimate of reserves is 1,329 trillion cubic feet in a country that consumes about 2.8 trillion cubic feet of gas per year.ImageBarbara Richardson, a former voter for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives, is one of the protesters in Lancashire who have promised to oppose any resumption of fracking.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesExperts are not so optimistic, however, because the real quantities that can be extracted only become clear once serious drilling begins. They say that any significant quantities of shale would take years to come on line, and so would not help the immediate crisis.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“It’s likely to be considerably more expensive here than in the U.S. because we don’t have the wide-open spaces; we are a very densely populated island,” said Dieter Helm, a professor of energy policy at Oxford University. He said that the geology in Britain was much more complex than in the shale-producing regions of the United States, and that the extent of reserves generally only became clear when companies drilled.“My guess is that the combination of the complexities and the dense population make it an order of magnitude more expensive than the U.S.,” he added.Nonetheless, supporters of shale think that the current energy crisis presents an opportunity to persuade consumers to think again. Speaking in Parliament, Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative lawmaker, said that communities should be asked whether they would be willing to commit to shale gas extraction in their area if it meant that they would be compensated with free gas.Outside a supermarket in Kirkham, not far from the Lancashire fracking site, shoppers expressed concern about the looming rise in energy bills.“We are going to be hit, for sure, but what can you do?” said Bob Whiteside, a retired driver, as he stood by an A.T.M., adding that he would welcome fracking if it cut bills. “Just get on with it,” he said.But not everyone shares his attitude.ImageThe entrance to the Quadrilla fracking site in Little Plumpton. Supporters of shale think that the current energy crisis presents an opportunity to persuade consumers to think again.Credit...Andrew Testa for The New York TimesClaire Stephenson, an opponent of fracking, described the noise of the 2019 quake as “an internal roar, the most bizarre thing I’ve ever experienced,” adding, “You could hear the ground and feel it shake: My cat fell off the bed.”Protesters in Lancashire who promise to oppose any resumption of fracking include Barbara Richardson, a former voter for Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives.“I’ve never been an environmentalist, I’ve never been a protester, we are not ‘Nimbys,’ we are not ‘green blobs,’” she said, referring to some of the descriptions applied by critics to groups in Lancashire opposed to shale gas.What’s happening now, she added, is “a last-ditch attempt by the fracking industry to try and get some credibility, and what’s despicable is that they are using the Ukrainian crisis to do it.”Locals thought that their opposition had killed off fracking, she said, “so I think a lot of people are shocked that it’s back on the table.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/world/europe/ukraine-uk-fracking-energy.html
128,"WASHINGTON — Russian mercenaries with combat experience in Syria and Libya are gearing up to assume an increasingly active role in a phase of the war in Ukraine that Moscow now says is its top priority: fighting in the country’s east.The number of mercenaries deployed to Ukraine from the Wagner Group, a private military force with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, is expected to more than triple to at least 1,000 fighters from about 300 a month ago, just before the invasion, a United States official said on Friday. The official added that the mercenaries would focus on defeating Ukrainian forces in the country’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting a war since 2014, and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.Dispatching trusted Russian mercenaries to help with a pivotal part of the Russian invasion underscores the Kremlin’s efforts to regroup and refocus its flagging, monthlong military campaign that so far has failed to achieve Mr. Putin’s initial goals, U.S. and other Western officials said.The Russian military signaled on Friday that it might be lowering its war ambitions and focusing on the eastern Donbas region, though military analysts said it remained to be seen whether the move constituted a meaningful shift or was a maneuver to distract attention ahead of another offensive.Wagner is the best-known of an array of Russian mercenary groups, which over the years have become more formalized, acting more like Western military contractors.“The Wagner Group is a private military contractor for Russia,” John F. Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said this week. “We know that they have interest in increasing their footprint in Ukraine.”Wagner’s fighters have garnered military experience in Middle East conflicts and serve as security advisers to various governments, including in the Central African Republic, Sudan and, most recently, Mali. Though they are loosely linked to the Russian military, they operate at a distance, which has allowed the Kremlin to try to deflect responsibility whenever the fighters’ behavior comes under scrutiny.Underscoring how seriously Wagner considers its role in the conflict in Ukraine, senior Wagner leaders themselves are expected to deploy to the separatist enclaves of Donetsk and Luhansk to coordinate efforts on behalf of Russia, the U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational assessments.Wagner is relocating not only some of its mercenaries in Libya and Syria to Ukraine, but also artillery, air defenses and radar that the group was using in Libya, the official said. The Russian military is supporting these transfers by providing military cargo aircraft to relocate personnel and equipment.While Wagner’s numbers are tiny compared with the more than 150,000 troops that Mr. Putin amassed on Ukraine’s borders and eventually sent into the country, their presence is an indication that Mr. Putin is taking a page from his playbook in 2014, when the Kremlin deployed Russian mercenaries, mostly veterans of the Russian military, to augment the forces of rebel fighters in eastern Ukraine.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 12:06 p.m. ETIn India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.For years, the U.S. sent mixed signals about its interests in Ukraine.

As many as 200 Russian mercenaries have been killed as of late February, the U.S. official said.The initial purpose of the deployment of the mercenaries was the subject of debate.

129,"In late January, while in Mariupol reporting on how Ukrainian forces were bracing for a Russian invasion, a New York Times video team captured drone footage over the Azovstal Iron and Steel works plant, an engine of industry for the southern port city.Three months later, the plant has become the last redoubt for Ukrainian defenders of the city against Russian forces.In peacetime, the sprawling factory complex, which opened in 1933 under Soviet rule, produced about four million tons of steel per year and employed thousands of local residents. The hulking factory dominated the city’s skyline, and in January it sent curling plumes of exhaust into the heavy winter sky.Now, another drone has captured a similar angle of the steel plant and its surroundings, showing images of devastation, including roofs of buildings crashed in and smoldering, collapsed bridges. The video, disseminated by Reuters, was first published by RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, which portrayed the images as being taken minutes before a supposed halt in Russia’s attack to give Ukraine’s defenders inside the plant a chance to lay down their arms. Prior Russian announcements of cease-fires have fallen through. The before-and-after footage shows the scale of destruction that Mariupol has suffered after nearly two months of near constant bombardment by Russian artillery, mortars and airstrikes. Ukrainian fighters and hundreds of civilians have hunkered down over the course of the siege, and an unknown number remain in the factory’s labyrinth of underground rooms and passages, with diminishing supplies inside.Ukrainian forces inside the plant have refused Russia’s ultimatums to surrender and vowed to fight until the “last drop of blood.” At the same time, they have pleaded for help from the outside world, either for a third party’s assistance in evacuating civilians or with weapons to fight their way out.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/world/europe/mariupol-azovstal-steel-mill.html
130,"CHERNOBYL, Ukraine — As the staging ground for an assault on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, one of the most toxic places on earth, was probably not the best choice. But that did not seem to bother the Russian generals who took over the site in the early stages of the war.“We told them not to do it, that it was dangerous, but they ignored us,” Valeriy Simyonov, the chief safety engineer for the Chernobyl nuclear site, said in an interview.Apparently undeterred by safety concerns, the Russian forces tramped about the grounds with bulldozers and tanks, digging trenches and bunkers — and exposing themselves to potentially harmful doses of radiation lingering beneath the surface.In a visit to the recently liberated nuclear station, site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, wind blew swirls of dust along the roads, and scenes of disregard for safety were everywhere, though Ukrainian nuclear officials say no major radiation leak was triggered by Russia’s monthlong military occupation.At just one site of extensive trenching a few hundred yards outside the town of Chernobyl, the Russian army had dug an elaborate maze of sunken walkways and bunkers. An abandoned armored personnel carrier sat nearby.The soldiers had apparently camped out for weeks in the radioactive forest. While international nuclear safety experts say they have not confirmed any cases of radiation sickness among the soldiers, the cancers and other potential health problems associated with radiation exposure might not develop until decades later.ImageThe Ukrainian military had to lay the temporary crossing to replace a bridge that retreating Russian forces destroyed.ImageAn abandoned Russian checkpoint in the Exclusion Zone. The camps showed signs of Russian forces digging in soil that could contain radioactivity 1,000 times ambient levels, enough to cause cancers.Mr. Simyonov said that the Russian military had deployed officers from a nuclear, biological and chemical unit, as well as experts from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear power company, who consulted with the Ukrainian scientists.But the Russian nuclear experts seemed to hold little sway over the army commanders, he said. The military men seemed more preoccupied with planning the assault on Kyiv and, after that failed, using Chernobyl as an escape route to Belarus for their badly mauled troops.“They came and did whatever they wanted” in the zone around the station, Mr. Simyonov said. Despite efforts by him and other Ukrainian nuclear engineers and technicians who remained at the site through the occupation, working round-the-clock and unable to leave except for one shift change in late March, the entrenching continued.The earthworks were not the only instance of recklessness in the treatment of a site so toxic it still holds the potential to spread radiation well beyond Ukraine’s borders.In a particularly ill-advised action, a Russian soldier from a chemical, biological and nuclear protection unit picked up a source of cobalt-60 at one waste storage site with his bare hands, exposing himself to so much radiation in a few seconds that it went off the scales of a Geiger counter, Mr. Simyonov said. It was not clear what happened to the man, he said.The most concerning moment, Mr. Simyonov said, came in mid-March, when electrical power was cut to a cooling pool that stores spent nuclear fuel rods that contain many times more radioactive material than was dispersed in the 1986 catastrophe. That raised the concern among Ukrainians of a fire if the water cooling the fuel rods boiled away, exposing them to the air, though that prospect was quickly dismissed by experts. “They’re emphasizing the worst-case scenarios, which are possible but not necessarily plausible,” said Edwin Lyman, a reactor expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists.The greater risk in a prolonged electricity shut off, experts say, was that hydrogen generated by the spent fuel could accumulate and explode. Bruno Chareyron, laboratory director at CRIIRAD, a French group that monitors radiation risks, cited a 2008 study of the Chernobyl site suggesting this could happen within about 15 days.Eventually, however, electricity was restored to the plant, allaying any fears.ImageReactor Number 4 in Chernobyl, now tightly sealed, exploded in 1986. Early fears of a radiation leak from a spent fuel storage site last month under Russian occupation never materialized.Image“We told them not to do it, that it was dangerous, but they ignored us,” said Valeriy Simyonov, left, the chief safety engineer at the Chernobyl nuclear site.The march to Kyiv on the western bank of the Dnipro River began and ended in Chernobyl for the 31st and 36th Combined Arms Armies of the Russian military, which traveled with an auxiliary of special forces and ethnic Chechen combatants.The formation surged into Ukraine on Feb. 24, fought for most of a month in the suburbs of Kyiv and then retreated, leaving in its wake incinerated armored vehicles, its own war dead, widespread destruction and evidence of human rights abuses, including hundreds of civilian bodies on the streets in the town of Bucha.As they retreated from Chernobyl, Russian troops blew up a bridge in the exclusion zone and planted a dense maze of anti-personnel mines, trip wires and booby traps around the defunct station. Two Ukrainian soldiers have stepped on mines in the past week, according to the Ukrainian government agency that manages the site.In a bizarre final sign of the unit’s misadventures, Ukrainian soldiers found discarded appliances and electronic goods on roads in the Chernobyl zone. These were apparently looted from towns deeper inside Ukraine and cast off for unclear reasons in the final retreat. Reporters found one washing machine on a road shoulder just outside the town of Chernobyl.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Employees of the exclusion zone management agency based in Chernobyl suffered under the Russian occupation, but nothing approaching the barbarity visited on civilians in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv by the Russian forces.The Russians had come in seemingly endless columns on the first day of the war, said Natasha Siloshenko, 45, a cook at a cafeteria serving nuclear workers. She had watched, warily, from a side street.“There was a sea of vehicles,” she said. “They came in waves through the zone, driving fast toward Kyiv.”There was little or no combat in the zone, so far as she could tell. The armored columns merely passed through.ImageThe Russian military used Chernobyl as a staging ground for its assault on the town of Bucha, where it suffered a defeat, but not before inflicting mayhem that Ukraine is calling “genocide.”ImageA man with a gunshot wound to the head by the side of the road outside of Bucha on Sunday.During the occupation, Russian soldiers searched the apartments of nuclear technicians and engineers, firefighters and support staff in the town of Chernobyl. “They took valuable items” from apartments, she said, but there was little violence.Workers tried to caution the Russians about radiation risks, to little avail.The background radiation in most of the 18-mile Exclusion Zone around the nuclear plant, after 36 years, poses scant risks and is about equivalent to a high-altitude airplane flight. But in invisible hot spots, some covering an acre or two, some just a few square yards, radiation can soar to thousands of times normal ambient levels.A soldier in such a spot would be exposed every hour to what experts consider a safe limit for an entire year, said Mr. Chareyron, the nuclear expert. The most dangerous isotopes in the soil are Cesium 137, Strontium 90 and various isotopes of plutonium. Days or weeks spent in these areas bring a high risk of causing cancer, he said.Throughout the zone, radioactive particles have settled into the soil to a depth of a few inches to a foot. They pose little threat if left underground, where their half-lives would tick by mostly harmlessly for decades or hundreds of years.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Widespread fears were raised last month when electrical power was cut off, threatening a radiation leak from the pool holding spent nuclear fuel rods.ImageAbandoned vehicles, which had been used as a roadblock, sat as a reminder of the Russian occupation of the town of Chernobyl.The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, issued a statement Thursday saying the agency had been unable to confirm reports of Russian soldiers sickened by radiation in the zone or to make an independent assessment of the radiation levels at the site. The agency’s automated radiation sensors in Chernobyl have been inoperable for more than a month, he said.The Ukrainian government’s radiation monitors ceased working the first day of the war, said Kateryna Pavlova, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Chernobyl Zone Management Agency. Readings from satellites, she said, showed slightly elevated radiation in some areas after the Russian occupation.Armored vehicles that run on treads, rather than wheels, pose the primary risk for radiation safety in a wider area, as they churn up the radioactive soil and spread it into areas of Belarus and Russia as they retreat, Ms. Pavlova said. “The next person who comes along can be contaminated,” she said.While the five-day cutoff in electricity did not lead to any disasters, it was still cause for enormous anxiety among the plant’s operators, said Sergei Makluk, a shift supervisor interviewed at the nuclear station on Thursday evening.The backup generators that kicked in require about 18,000 gallons of diesel fuel a day. In the first days, Russian officers assured plant employees that they would have enough fuel, drawn from the supplies being trucked in for armored vehicles in the fighting in the Kyiv suburbs, Mr. Makluk said. But by the fifth day, with the military’s well-documented logistical problems, the officers said they would no longer supply the diesel.“They said, ‘There’s not enough fuel for the front,’” and that a power cable leading to Belarus should be used to draw electricity from the Belarusian grid to cool the waste pool instead. Mr. Simyonov, the chief safety engineer, characterized the threat to halt diesel supplies for generators as “blackmail” to force the authorities in Belarus to resolve the problem. However it happened, the electricity was restored in time and the nuclear fuel never came close to overheating.All in all, the trench digging and other dubious activities posed a far lower risk than the waste pool, and most of that to the Russian soldiers themselves, Mr. Simyonov said, adding wryly: “We invite them back to dig more trenches here, if they want.”William J.

131,"ISTANBUL — The first signs of significant progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine emerged on Tuesday, but there was no hint of an imminent end to the suffering, with Russia appearing determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine and officials predicting that weeks of further negotiation were needed.After three hours of talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to declare itself permanently neutral — forsaking the prospect of joining NATO, a key Russian demand — and discuss Russian territorial claims in exchange for “security guarantees” from a group of other nations. An aide to Ukraine’s president called the Russian delegation “constructive,” while Russia said it would “drastically” scale back its military activity around Kyiv to “increase mutual trust.”Russia’s statement that it will de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv — even as it keeps pounding other parts of Ukraine — may be little more than putting a positive gloss on its military being stymied in its attempts to seize or encircle the capital. In recent days, Ukrainian counteroffensives around the city have forced back Russian forces in some of the fiercest street battles of the war, though they remain within striking distance of Kyiv.Now, Russian officials said, the goal will be to take more territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia has installed two separatist statelets that President Vladimir V. Putin recognized last month as independent, but that no other nation has formally acknowledged.Western officials and security analysts cautioned against taking at face value Russia’s statements about its aims in Kyiv or elsewhere.ImageVolunteers from the the group called Free Ukraine, now part of the Kyiv Territorial Defence Forces, in Kyiv on Tuesday, before moving on to another location where they will continue their training.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesPresident Biden said he would not draw any conclusions about Russia’s intentions “until I see what their actions are.” Speaking after a White House meeting with the prime minister of Singapore, Mr. Biden added, “We’ll see if they follow through with what they are suggesting.”“In the meantime,” Mr. Biden said, “we’re going to continue to keep strong the sanctions and will continue to provide the Ukrainian military with the capacity to defend themselves.”Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, on a diplomatic trip to Morocco, told reporters, “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” adding, “and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has worked hard to present Mr. Putin with a negotiated way to end the war, accompanied by Ukrainian concessions that would not go so far as to make his country a Russian satellite.The offer to declare a permanent neutral status, Ukrainian officials in Istanbul said, means it would neither join the NATO alliance nor host foreign troops — a scenario that Mr. Putin used as one of the justifications for his invasion.Ukrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a diverse group of countries — potentially including the United States, Germany, Turkey and China — would commit, if Ukraine were attacked, to providing it with military assistance and to imposing a no-fly zone if necessary. It was not clear that any of those countries had signed on to such guarantees.ImageA Ukrainian government administration building in Mykolaiv after being hit by a missile on Tuesday.Credit...Nacho Doce/Reuters“This is probably the best outcome that could’ve been hoped for today,” said Samuel Charap, who studies Russian foreign policy at the RAND Corporation. “The Ukrainians have at least come up with something concrete to address the core Russian demand for Ukraine’s neutrality.”Ukraine also signaled readiness to consider concessions related to the parts of its territory already occupied by Russia. It proposed a 15-year negotiating process for Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and said it was ready to rule out trying to retake it by force. Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.Russia, for its part, said it was prepared to accelerate planning for such a summit meeting — something that Mr. Zelensky had long sought and that Moscow had resisted, casting Ukraine’s government as a mere puppet of Washington. But now, the Kremlin appears to be increasingly prepared to deal with Mr. Zelensky — in part because Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield is leaving it no other choice.Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation, said that he viewed Ukraine’s proposals as “a constructive step in the search for a compromise.”“If the treaty is worked out quickly and the required compromise is found, the possibility of making peace will be much closer,” Mr. Medinsky said.Ukraine and Russia would need at least two more weeks for talks with Russia and potential guarantor countries, Oleksandr Chalyi, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told reporters after Tuesday’s session. Turkey said it was prepared to host a meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to flesh out Tuesday’s talks, followed by a possible meeting between the two presidents.“You have shouldered a historic responsibility,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who hosted Tuesday’s talks at a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, told the Russian and Ukrainian delegates. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”ImagePresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey during the Ukrainian-Russian talks in Istanbul on Tuesday.Credit...Murat Cetin Muhurdar/Turkish Presidential Press Service, via AFP -- Getty ImagesTurkey has emerged as a pivotal intermediary in the talks, one of the few countries to maintain close ties to both Russia and Ukraine after the invasion. Though it is a NATO member, Turkey has refused to put in place sanctions against Russia, even as it offers military support to Ukraine. To underscore the latter, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, posted on Twitter on Tuesday a selfie with Haluk Bayraktar, a close associate of Mr. Erdogan and the head of a Turkish company that makes armed drones used by Ukraine.But despite the positive signals, myriad diplomatic pitfalls remained. For example, Ukraine said that the international security guarantees would not apply to the disputed Donbas, but it is not clear how that area would be defined; the separatists claim far more territory than they controlled before the war.“The Russian delegation is constructive,” Mr. Podolyak, who is an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said. “This doesn’t mean that the negotiations are easy. They are difficult.”There was also no reprieve on the ground in Ukraine. On Tuesday morning, a Russian cruise missile strike destroyed part of the main regional government office building in the southern city of Mikolaiv, killing at least nine people and injuring at least 28, Ukrainian officials said.

The Russian advance along the Black Sea coast west of Crimea stalled outside Mikolaiv, in an area that has seen intense combat.Another Russian missile struck an oil depot on Monday night in the Rivne region in northwestern Ukraine, the second to be destroyed there, according to the regional administrator.“The scale of the challenges has not diminished,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement. “The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts.”The U.S. and British governments confirmed Ukrainian gains in towns around Kyiv — notably Irpin, scene of some of the fiercest street fighting — but advised skepticism about claims that Russia’s stance had changed.ImageInhabitants of Irpin, scene of intense fighting, continued to evacuate on Tuesday after Ukranian troops were reported to have made gains on the invading Russians.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. But, he added, “We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas in Ukraine.”The British Defense Ministry warned that “Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability.”Russia has signaled that it was narrowing its war aims to focus on taking more territory in the Donbas. Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, on Tuesday offered a possible justification for winding down the war effort elsewhere in the country by declaring, in televised remarks in Moscow, that Russia’s initial mission was accomplished.“In general, the main goals of the first stage of the special operation have been completed,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The combat potential of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.”Russian forces have taken control of a land bridge along Ukraine’s southeastern coast linking Crimea to the Donbas. The lone holdout in that strip is the center of the devastated port city of Mariupol, where, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Tuesday, the Russians are still gaining ground, slowly tightening the noose around the fighters and civilians who remain.Thousand of civilians have been killed in Mariupol, according to local officials — a claim that cannot be independently verified — and much of the city has been flattened. It remains under “continuous heavy shelling” by Russian forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.ImagePhotographs of missing Ukranian civilians, said to have been captured by Russian troops since the beginning of March, projected during a demonstration on Tuesday in the central part of Lviv.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesIn the nearby port of Berdyansk, captured by the Russians, an evacuation convoy took 34 buses full of civilians out of the city, headed into territory held by Ukraine.

132,"KYIV, Ukraine — There are fields instead of city streets, farmsteads instead of apartment buildings. Open highways stretch to the horizon.The battles in the north that Ukraine won over the past seven weeks raged in towns and densely populated suburbs around the capital, Kyiv, but the war is about to take a hard turn to the southeast and into a vast expanse of wide-open flatland, fundamentally changing the nature of the combat, the weapons at play and the strategies that might bring victory.Military analysts, Ukrainian commanders, soldiers and even Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, acknowledge that a wider war that began with a failed attempt to capture the capital will now be waged in the eastern Donbas region.With few natural barriers, the armies can try to flank and surround each other, firing fierce barrages of artillery from a distance to soften enemy positions.“What we’re talking about is, no kidding, a conventional, very lethal battle of maneuvers where Russian forces are going to attack Ukraine’s fixed positions on ground that is more open,” said Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe.ImageAn armored convoy last month in a Russia-controlled area on the road to Mariupol, Ukraine, on the southern edge of the Donbas region.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersDonbas is an area the size of New Hampshire, with a front line stretching hundreds of miles; Russia borders it in an arc to the north and east, and most residents speak Russian. Named for the rich Donets Basin of coal seams just below the surface, the region is dotted with Soviet-era mining and factory towns across the sprawl of sunflower fields and grassy plains.Before Russia invaded in February, Ukraine had been fighting Russia-backed separatists there since 2014, when Moscow fomented an uprising and sent in forces to support it. That war had settled into a stalemate, with each side controlling territory and neither gaining much ground.Now, what may be the decisive phase of Mr. Putin’s latest war is returning to that same region, blighted by eight years of conflict and littered with land mines and trenches, as he tries to conquer the portion of Donbas still held by Ukraine. Neither side has made a major move in recent days, and analysts say it will most likely require a long and bloody conflict for either one to prevail.The plains would seem to favor Russia’s raw advantage in weaponry. But as a defending force, Ukraine has an advantage in striking from entrenched positions at Russian troops as they advance over open ground and into artillery range.Both sides are mustering troops for a major battle, with the Russian forces regrouping after being battered and driven from Kyiv, their units fragmented by heavy casualties and equipment losses.Overall, Russia has increased the number of battalion fighting groups in the east to 40 — as many as 40,000 troops — from 30 this month, with more reinforcements on the way, Pentagon officials said. Moscow has withdrawn as many as 40,000 troops from northern Ukraine to reorganize, rearm and resupply them in Russia and Belarus, and is expected to move at least some to the east by driving through Russia in the next few weeks.ImageA Ukrainian Army front-line position in February in Novozvanivka, in the Luhansk region.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesUkraine’s army in the east had been estimated at about 30,000 troops before Russia invaded. After repelling the Russian assault on Kyiv, the military’s elite units redeployed to eastern Ukraine, but estimating the size and strength of Ukrainian forces there now is difficult. The units are smaller and more mobile than Russia’s, and the government has revealed no details of their movements.In this new phase of the war, the Ukrainians will need a new arsenal of weapons — particularly long-range artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems. They will also require more armored vehicles to protect their forces and to tow artillery pieces to the front lines.Western countries are responding to this need. Slovakia this week provided Ukraine with a potent, long-range antiaircraft missile system, the S-300. And on Wednesday, President Biden announced an $800 million military aid package to Ukraine that for the first time included more-powerful weaponry, including 18 155-millimeter howitzers, 40,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and 200 armored personnel carriers.The weapons from the West have caught Russia’s attention. Moscow sent a formal diplomatic note of protest to warn the United States of “unpredictable consequences” of shipping such arms, American officials said on Friday.Perhaps the biggest difference from the northern phase of the war, fought among towns, woods and hills, will be the terrain. Military analysts are forecasting an all-out, bloody battle on the steppe. “There’s nowhere to hide,” said Maksim Finogin, a veteran of Ukraine’s conflict in Donbas.ImageA satellite image showing a military convoy moving south through farmland near Velykyi Burluk, east of Kharkiv, this month.Credit...Maxar Technologies, via ReutersThe narrow tree lines provide scant cover for small units, but not much more, he said. “And we can be seen from above, by aviation and by drones,” Mr. Finogin added. “Artillery can strike at any moment.”Anton Gerashchenko, Ukraine’s deputy interior minister, who has been pressing Western nations to quickly provide more weaponry, said, “It’s like fighting in Kansas.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 6:26 p.m. ETAt a military hospital in Ukraine, wounded soldiers pour in from the front lines in the east.‘They’re trying to wipe us off the face of the earth’: A fighter describes dire conditions in a Mariupol steel plant.Working on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Both sides will try encirclements, military analysts say. It will become an artillery war, fought at distances of dozens of miles, where Ukraine’s edge in the motivation and morale of its soldiers could be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of Russian artillery pieces, tanks and attack helicopters. Moscow is expected to use this heavy firepower to batter enemy positions before sending in ground troops to try to seize them.Donbas has been a target for years for Mr. Putin, who claims it is really a part of Russia and has justified the war with the false narrative that he needs to liberate the region from genocidal Nazi oppressors. Ukrainians soundly reject that claim as they fight fiercely for their territory.But invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, trying to capture large swaths of the country and topple its government, was a high-stakes gambit that turned much of the world against Mr. Putin. And after failing to take Kyiv and being forced to scale back his hopes of seizing the length of the southern coast, Mr. Putin has set his sights, for now, on the east.“Our goal is to help the people who live in Donbas, who feel their unbreakable bond with Russia,” he said this week.Mr. Putin’s true intentions are rarely clear, however, and his assertion of Russia’s more limited war aims cannot be taken at face value. In the past, Russia has lied about its troops’ presence in Donbas and Crimea, and it stated repeatedly in the weeks before the current war that it had no intention of invading.ImageUkrainian troops demonstrating military tactics and vehicles in February, just days before the Russian invasion.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesFor soldiers, artillery battles on the open plains can bring instant death or become drawn-out, harrowing ordeals.Both the Russians and Ukrainians use Soviet-designed heavy artillery systems, named for flowers or trees — the Acacia 152-millimeter self-propelled gun, the Tulip 240-millimeter mortar, the Carnation 122-millimeter howitzer. Their incongruous labels belie their lethal abilities; they can saturate areas the size of football fields with shrapnel.The strategy on the steppe, now as in wars past, has been to outflank and surround enemy forces, then pummel them with artillery, as the Soviets did over this same terrain in World War II. After defeating Nazi forces at Stalingrad, the Red Army went on the offensive across the plains in 1943, punching through Axis lines. It then encircled German troops in ever smaller pockets of territory, killing them with artillery.Lesha, 43, a Ukrainian soldier who asked to be identified by only his first name for safety reasons, endured an encirclement in the town of Ilovaisk while fighting Russian troops who had intervened in Donbas in 2014.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.“The surrounding forces draw in closer, tighten the flanks and then methodically destroy” those trapped inside with artillery, he said, recalling a strategy that nearly cost him his life.ImageThe town of Trostianets was heavily damaged by artillery fire from both sides.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesDuring that siege in Ilovaisk, which lasted about five days, Ukrainian soldiers lay in shallow trenches or root cellars, he said, covering their ears with their hands and opening their mouths, to better endure the pressure waves of Grad rocket artillery landing yards away.About 300 Ukrainian soldiers died in a retreat from the town after Russian forces reneged on a cease-fire agreement. Lesha was captured and eventually freed in a prisoner exchange.However tragic, he said, Ilovaisk and similar battles taught the army and political leadership hard-won lessons. Ukrainian units are now resilient under fire, he said. Commanders pay no heed to local Russian cease-fire offers. And above all, he said, the army learned the need for long-range weapons to fight back in open spaces.Despite the Russian advantage in troop numbers and armaments, open terrain offers at least one benefit to the Ukrainian defenders, analysts said: Whatever is trying to advance, whether a platoon of 30 soldiers or a battalion flanked by armored vehicles, will have to cross exposed areas.And as Ukrainian forces have already shown, their willingness to destroy their own infrastructure, like dams to cause flooding or bridges to close roads, has proved effective in stalling Russian forces, leaving them vulnerable to counterattack.In Donbas, it will be no different. Bridges, roads and fields all can be mined and possibly destroyed to channel Russian forces toward Ukrainian soldiers who are dug into defensive positions. They will be armed with anti-tank guided missiles and backed by artillery already pre-sighted on important pieces of terrain like road intersections.When Ukrainian forces retook Trostianets in northeastern Ukraine in March, for example, their artillery successfully destroyed the Russian artillery battery placed in the town, opening the way for a counterattack with tanks and infantry.ImageA damaged Russian self-propelled howitzer this month in Trostianets.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesIt may be weeks before the sides join in a major battle, and it also may instead become a series of incremental, lethal encounters lasting months, according to American, British and Ukrainian officials and military analysts.“It’s going to be a really ugly, slow-moving war, in which the front lines don’t move for weeks,” said a senior Biden administration official, insisting on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Still, the Russian military appears to have learned from mistakes it made in the Kyiv suburbs and along the Azov and Black Sea coasts. Hampered by a top-down structure that allowed battlefield officers little autonomy, the Kremlin has now designated a single theater commander, Gen. Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, a former commander of the Russian army in Syria known for brutal tactics there.And the fight in the east will begin closer to supply lines stretching back to the Russian border; that could be key for a mechanized Russian army advancing in a major conventional assault across the countryside.“They are now prepared to fight the war that they really want,” the retired Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, a former NATO supreme allied commander for Europe, said of the Russians. “They want to meet force on force in open fields and go at it.”ImageA Ukrainian Army front-line position in February near the separatist-controlled settlement of Slovianoserbsk, in the Luhansk region.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAndrew E.

133,"The idea that Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine would be a restorative tonic for Western liberalism, touted hopefully in the first few weeks of war, has taken sharp blows in recent days.First came the election in Hungary, where Viktor Orban’s conservative populist government won a sweeping popular majority, despite — or, more likely, because of — Orban’s relatively dovish approach to the struggle in Ukraine. Then came the presidential-election polling out of France, where Marine Le Pen is suddenly climbing in second-round polls, threatening Emmanuel Macron with a shocking upset.Le Pen will probably still lose, not least because her past friendliness to Putin will get more attention between this weekend’s first-round vote and the runoff, assuming she wins through. But there is no sign as yet that the war has prompted a vast revulsion against nationalism or populism, a stampede back to the liberal establishment.Another possibility, however, is that the Ukraine war could help the liberal establishment in the long run, by encouraging an internal reassessment of what liberalism itself should seek to be.For example, a writer who seemed overly hopeful about the liberal-revival scenario in the first days of the war, Francis Fukuyama, has now written a searching essay for Foreign Affairs on why “liberalism needs the nation” arguing that the heroic resistance of the Ukrainians should teach liberals a lesson about the virtues of national identity.“With their bravery,” he writes, the Ukrainians “have made clear that citizens are willing to die for liberal ideals, but only when those ideals are embedded in a country they can call their own.” The war has thus been a partial rebuke to the fantasy of a pure cosmopolitanism, of a liberalism that transcends borders, languages and specific histories. And it’s offered a case study in how the nation-state, its loves and loyalties, can unite a disparate population around a common cause in a way that no supranational institution has ever been able to achieve.The challenge, though, is that the “sense of national purpose” Fukuyama is praising in Ukraine conspicuously depends on an external enemy, a wolf at the door, and you cannot simply will such an enemy into being. (Nor should you wish to!) Whereas most of the peacetime sources of national solidarity he cites, from food and sports to literary traditions, are somewhat thinner things. And one of the potentially thicker forces, a sense of religious unity within a liberal order, Fukuyama rules out: In a pluralist society, “the idea of restoring a shared moral tradition defined by religious belief is a nonstarter,” leading only to sectarianism and violence if applied.But that might be too simplistic. Certainly you cannot impose strict religious uniformity upon a pluralist democracy. But the liberal order in America, at least, long relied for solidarity and purpose on a softer religious consensus, a flexible religious center, based on Protestant Christianity and then expanding to a more ecumenical but still biblically rooted vision. From the 19th century through the civil rights era, this shared worldview supplied not just a generic unity but a constant moral touchstone for would-be reformers, a metaphysical horizon for the entire American project.Here Fukuyama’s essay might be usefully supplemented by my colleague Ezra Klein’s recent meditation on how Western liberalism appears when seen through the eyes of its enemies — meaning not just Putinism, with its spurious Christian justifications for aggressive war, but certain radical-right philosophers who have rejected liberalism and Christianity together, seeing the latter as the original source of liberalism’s egalitarianism, its attention to the poor and marginalized, and its restless quest for universal dignity (all of which they reject and despise).To push Klein’s idea a little further, you might say that since the 1960s, when the old Protestant consensus cracked up, the American system has been in search of a form of religion that can ground its liberalism in something like that way.That search has been unsuccessful. The religious right proved too conservative and parochial (and scandal-plagued) for a diverse and liberalizing country, and it cracked up with George W. Bush’s presidency. The liberal Christianity of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, while in certain ways better suited to hold the religious center, lacks internal vitality and is easily subsumed into a mixture of pantheism and gnosticism, with its moral vision supplied by a progressive activism that’s intolerant in its own distinctive way. These failures have left us with a spiritual competition between an ascendant wokeness and a resentful Christian nationalism, which isn’t likely to supply unity or solidarity to anyone.But notably, throughout these culture wars, liberalism’s inner party, its intellectual elite, has retained a conception of itself as resolutely secular, persistently imagining a perfected, post-religious liberal order that can establish solidarity and purpose without any of the old American appeals to Providence or nature’s God.It will be a sign that liberalism is ready to confront its present challenges, all the unhappiness of its citizens and children, when that illusion is finally and irrevocably put away.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

135,"LVIV, Ukraine — Yevhen Tishchenko stood on the train platform trying to wrestle bulging, woven plastic duffel bags onto an old luggage cart while his wife lifted their disabled youngest child onto a plastic tricycle.Mr. Tishchenko, a furniture salesman, and his wife, Tetiana Komisarova, arrived at this train station in western Ukraine after walking for five days with their children to reach safety. They did not know where they were going. But they knew it was better than where they had come from — Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, which has been bombarded by Russian forces for weeks.The family’s home was far from the steelworks mill where soldiers are sheltering underground, holding off Russian troops trying to take the city’s last vestige of territory held by Ukraine.But Mariupol has been devastated by fighting, with shortages of medicine, food and electricity.The couple did not own a car. When conditions became unbearable last Sunday, they packed the fraying bags with clothes and food and started walking with their four children. Their oldest child is 12, and their youngest, at 6, suffers from microcephaly, a rare condition that requires regular neurological monitoring and psychiatric consultations.They left behind Mr. Tishchenko’s elderly mother, who could not walk, and their gray-and-white cat, named Mosia by Uliana, the 6-year-old.Their journey out of the city was macabre: decomposing bodies, shelling in the distance, Russian military convoys and checkpoints. “The city was turned into one big cemetery,” said Ms. Komisarova, 42. “We lived near Shevchenko Boulevard. There was a strip of land between two roads, and corpses were lying there for a long time. I’ve never seen so many dead bodies in my life.”At each Russian checkpoint, they would say Ms. Komisarova had a sister in the next town. And at each checkpoint, perhaps moved by a large family struggling with children, the soldiers let them through. Some showed them photos of their own children.“At one of them, a Russian soldier started asking us where we were going,” she said. “I said ‘Orikhove’. And then he said: ‘No, don’t go there. It’s being shelled. Go somewhere west.’”She said they would stop in villages where people would let them stay.In a village near Rozivka, she found out that the friend she had hoped to stay with had escaped. So they spent the night in a deserted house with other displaced people.“We made a fire in a clay oven to keep warm, and then the neighbors came. They boiled potatoes with fried eggs for us. They fed us well,” she said.On the fifth day, they were picked up by a man with a load of radishes and taken to the train station in Zaporizhzhia.Arriving in Lviv, Ms. Komisarova and the children waited outside the station by the pile of luggage as Mr. Tishchenko went off to ask where they could find shelter. Looking around at the vehicles coming and going, the former high school teacher said she had forgotten what traffic looked like.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Her eldest daughter, Anna, 10, carried a Hello Kitty backpack and a green stuffed toy identical to the one her sister had been given along the way. A volunteer gave the children Easter chocolates they put in their pockets but did not eat.Mr. Tishchenko, 37, has not been able to reach his mother but the children said their father had boarded up the shattered windows before they left, and they believed their grandmother would be all right.They again hoisted the bags onto a street tram to take them to a resettlement office where they would be given a place to stay in a school that had been turned into a shelter for the displaced. At the office, one of the guards wiped tears from her eyes as she sat with the children while their parents were being interviewed.Ms. Komisarova, a former Ukrainian language and literature teacher, said they intended to return when Mariupol was safe again.“Honestly, we don’t have a specific plan where to go until then,” she said. “I remember the moment when we reached the first Ukrainian checkpoint and saw our flags and heard a soldier speaking our language. I was just sitting in the car and crying. We really want Mariupol to be Ukrainian again.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/mariupol-ukraine-family-escape.html

He said no one should have thought his comments were meant to be calling for Putin’s ouster.The diplomatic rumblings come as the war, now in its fifth week, enters a more volatile phase. Ukraine claimed advances in the northeast, while Russia continued its assault on Mariupol, which defense analysts say may soon fall. Kyiv remains in play. The mayor of Irpin, one of the largest and most fiercely contested suburbs, said Ukrainian forces had pushed Russians out. But Moscow’s forces continue to try to capture key towns east and northwest of the capital.Talks: The two sides prepared to meet in Turkey today for the first time in weeks. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he was open to discussing a neutral geopolitical status for his country, but the Kremlin offered little hope for an agreement that would end the fighting.Surveillance: Nokia, a Finnish company, played a key role in enabling Russia’s cyberspying, raising questions of corporate responsibility.State of the war:Russia seems to be refocusing its territorial ambitions on cementing control of the east.Ukrainian officials also claimed that Russian forces had been pushed out of two towns near Sumy, a provincial capital, and that the Ukrainian military had taken control of two towns close to Kharkiv.A video shows soldiers who are probably Ukrainian beating and shooting prisoners from the Russian military, a possible violation of the Geneva Conventions.The U.N. said that more than 1,100 civilians had been killed in the war, including 99 children.Other updates:Novaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper whose editor shared the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, suspended publication, leaving Russia without any major media outlets critical of the Kremlin.Some Afghan refugees in Britain, still in limbo, are worried about what could happen when Ukrainians arrive.ImageIsrael’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, center, walked with his Bahraini counterpart, Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani, after the summit.Credit...Pool photo by Jacquelyn MartinThe Middle East summit endsA two-day summit ended yesterday, after the top diplomats of Israel, the U.S. and four Arab countries — Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt — met in person in Israel for groundbreaking talks.Discussion centered on shared concerns, particularly over Iran and the militia it backs in Yemen that has attacked Gulf oil facilities. Middle Eastern leaders were united in their frustration with the U.S. for seeking a new nuclear deal with Iran and pushed back against aspects of the proposed agreement that they deemed too lenient.Tensions: Diplomats discussed an upcoming convergence of religious holidays, which could raise the temperature between Israelis and Palestinians.

137,"SEOUL — When Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in the 1990s, experts debated whether the decision would make the country safer or more vulnerable to an invasion from Moscow, its nuclear-armed neighbor.Now, as Russia pounds Ukrainian cities while being accused of committing atrocities against civilians, many in South Korea say there is no more room for debate.Since the conflict began, South Koreans have flooded online chat rooms with discussions about their country’s need to have nuclear weapons to prevent an invasion from North Korea, their own nuclear-armed neighbor. On Tuesday, North Korea warned that it would use its nuclear weapons “at the outset of war,” should one with the South ever start.Like Ukraine, South Korea once had nuclear weapons within its borders. And Seoul abandoned its own covert nuclear program in the 1970s in exchange for security guarantees from the United States. But as they watch Ukrainians battle Russian forces and plead for outside military assistance, many South Koreans fear that was a mistake.“There is no justice in this world, only national interests,” said one commentator on Twitter. “We must build our own defense, arming ourselves with nuclear weapons, unless we want to find ourselves in the sorry state Ukraine is in now.”South Koreans have demanded nuclear weapons for years as North Korea expanded its arsenal and provoked Washington with missile tests. In one recent survey of South Koreans, 71 percent of the respondents supported arming the country with nuclear weapons, according to a research paper published in February by the Carnegie Endowment and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.ImagePresident Donald J. Trump with Kim Jung-un, the leader of North Korea, and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, at the Demilitarized Zone in 2019.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesWhile North and South Korea see the war in Ukraine differently — with the North supporting Russia and the South condemning Moscow’s military adventurism — both countries appear to have drawn similar conclusions from the conflict.For South Koreans, the war has shown the extent to which a nuclear-armed power can get away with invading a non-nuclear neighbor when fears of nuclear war make intervention less likely. And for the North, it offered further proof of the advantages of a homegrown nuclear deterrent.Analysts say North Korea is now more determined than ever to keep its nuclear arsenal, as the South confronts its own vulnerability.“The war in Ukraine is a chilling reminder that when things get really dicey, there is a limit to how much your friends can do for you,” said Cho Kyong-hwan, a member of the Presidential Commission on Policy Planning in Seoul. “At the end of the day, you only have your own power to defend yourself.”Drawing parallels between South Korea and Ukraine can be misleading. South Korea ranks sixth in the world in military strength and North Korea is 30th, according to the Global Firepower Index, which ranks conventional war-making capabilities. (Ukraine is 22nd and Russia is second.)Ukraine is not a NATO member and does not have a formal alliance with the United States, whereas Seoul and Washington are bound by a mutual defense treaty.When the defense chiefs of the United States and South Korea held their annual meeting in December, Washington renewed its commitment to “extended deterrence,” vowing to defend its South Korean ally with all its military capabilities, “including nuclear,” should war break out on the Korean Peninsula. About 28,500 American troops are stationed here.ImageNews of North Korea’s recent ICBM launch was broadcast on a television screen in Seoul Station in March.Credit...Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA, via ShutterstockStill, many in the country cannot shake the fear that they might one day be abandoned by the United States.South Koreans questioned Washington’s commitment to the alliance when President Donald J. Trump demanded what they said were exorbitant sums for keeping American troops in the country. They watched in disbelief as the United States led a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.And as they witnessed Washington’s failure to prevent the Russian invasion of Ukraine, they wondered whether the United States would stop North Korea from invading the South, especially at the risk of leaving American cities and military bases in the Asia-Pacific more vulnerable to a nuclear attack.“We don’t see global American leadership anymore. Instead, we rather find it feckless and helpless,” Lee Sang-min, a senior lawmaker affiliated with the governing Democratic Party, told a parliamentary hearing in February. “We even get skeptical whether we should rely entirely on the United States on issues that relate directly to our survival and prosperity.”People in both Koreas view themselves as a small nation that has suffered numerous invasions and been occupied and divided by foreign forces. A once-common Korean saying advised: “Don’t trust the Americans and don’t be fooled by the Soviets, the Japanese will rise again and the Chinese will kill you — Koreans, be careful!”Last week, Ukrainian officials warned that Russia may try to divide their country as Korea was divided after World War II.Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, has called his nuclear arsenal a “treasured sword” that will safeguard his country once and for all from foreign invaders. “We must be strong,” Mr. Kim said after resuming intercontinental ballistic missile tests in March. Only “nuclear war deterrence” will protect North Korea from “all threats and blackmails by the imperialists.”Not long ago, similar ideas were popular in South Korea. In the 1990s, a novel titled “The Rose of Sharon Blooms Again” became a runaway best seller, with a plotline promoting nuclear nationalism.In the book, the C.I.A. is suspected of assassinating a Korean nuclear physicist to stop him from building nuclear weapons, but South and North Korea join forces to build them — and deter another Japanese invasion of Korea.“Who can guarantee that the Americans will remain our protector forever?” the protagonist, a newspaper reporter chasing the C.I.A. plot, says in the novel’s most famous line.ImagePresident Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signing the trilateral statement on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, in Moscow on Jan. 12, 1994.Credit...Wojtek Laski/Getty ImagesIn real life, South Korea’s military dictator, Park Chung-hee, embarked on a covert nuclear weapons program in the 1970s, when the United States began reducing its military presence in the country. Washington forced Seoul to abandon the program, promising to keep the country under its so-called nuclear umbrella.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.In 1991, the United States withdrew all of its nuclear weapons from South Korea, once numbering as many as 950, as part of the global nuclear arms reduction program. But Washington could not stop North Korea from building its own nuclear arsenal.That has left South Korea facing three nuclear states to the north and west: North Korea, Russia and China.“South Koreans wonder who would protect them if the United States bowed out,” said Lee Byong-chul, an expert in nuclear proliferation at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.Calls for nuclear weapons have often bubbled up in South Korea over the decades, but they have never become a part of a mainstream political movement. President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who has promised to strengthen ties with the United States, has disavowed a nuclear-armed South Korea.Washington fears that if Seoul were to build nuclear weapons, it would trigger a regional arms race and eliminate any hope of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. Secretary of the Army Christine Elizabeth Wormuth said last month that she “would be hesitant to contemplate” bringing nuclear weapons back to the peninsula.Analysts like Mr. Cho, however, have argued it is time for Washington to boost South Korea’s confidence in extended deterrence. One possibility, they say, is to introduce a nuclear-sharing agreement with Seoul, similar to the one in which NATO aircraft would be allowed to carry American nuclear weapons in wartime.ImageDefense Secretary Lloyd J.

And if Washington were facing conflicts in both Taiwan and South Korea, how would it respond?Uncomfortable questions such as these have led to “greater calls for South Korea to actually have its own nuclear deterrent,” said Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, during an online forum last month. “This is an issue that we’re really going to have to grapple with in the near future.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/asia/ukraine-south-korea-nuclear-weapons.html
138,"Produced by ‘The Ezra Klein Show’The Russia-Ukraine war has changed considerably in recent weeks. Vladimir Putin is no longer talking explicitly about regime change in Ukraine. The Russian military has shifted its focus away from taking Kyiv and toward making territorial gains in Ukraine’s east. The prospect of an outright Ukrainian victory is no longer out of the question. And negotiations between the parties over a possible settlement appear to be making some progress.There’s been a darker turn as well: Over the weekend, images surfaced of atrocities committed by the Russian military against Ukrainian civilians. And Western leaders are considering expanding military aid to Ukraine, initiating war crimes investigations and placing harsher sanctions on Russia in response.[You can listen to this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]Fiona Hill served as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council under Donald Trump and as a national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia under Barack Obama and George W. Bush. I had her on the show a few weeks ago to help me make sense of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as it was developing at the time, and it was one of the most illuminating perspectives I’d heard on the topic. So I invited her back to discuss how the situation has changed, where we are now and how the conflict could develop moving forward.We discuss why Hill has become pessimistic about the possibility of a peace deal, how the carnage in Bucha could alter the course of the conflict, why Russia has been so much weaker on the battlefield than expected, whether Ukraine can achieve an outright victory, why this war is making Putin more popular in Russia (not less), what else the West could be doing to support Ukraine, why Hill thinks we’re entering a “much darker” phase of the conflict, what role China could play in bringing about a negotiated settlement, what a renewed framework for European security could look like and more.You can listen to our whole conversation by following “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.

139,"KORCZOWA, Poland — On the second day of the war, Tanya quit her job as a tax accountant in Massachusetts and told her husband that she had to go home to Ukraine. Her sister and her sister’s two teenage sons were holed up in the bathroom of their home in Mariupol, a seaside city that was getting shelled. Tanya got a text from her: “We’re so scared.”By the sixth day of the war, her sister’s water had been cut. They couldn’t even flush the toilet. “We’ll use the cat litter box,” her sister wrote. Go to a bomb shelter, Tanya urged. Then, suddenly, the text messages stopped.Tanya sobbed, imagining them dead. But her father, who lives in the pro-Russian city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, didn’t believe that Russian troops would hurt them. He called it fake news, dismissing the images of destruction. He sent her video of Russian soldiers saying: “Don’t be afraid. We just came here to free you.”Tanya cursed him out and blocked him on her messaging app. The next day, she caught a flight to Poland.ImageAn apartment building on fire after shelling in Mariupol.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressI met Tanya in Boston’s airport on March 2, as we waited for a flight to Warsaw. I saw her Ukrainian passport and her eyes, puffy from crying, and asked her to tell me her story. I ended up traveling with her to the Ukrainian border and have kept in touch with her ever since. Tanya is a nickname — she didn’t want to use her real name, to protect her parents, who she feared might face retaliation in Donetsk for her choices.The war in Ukraine is often portrayed as a battle between autocracy and democracy; the East against the West. Tanya’s story reveals that, for many families, it can also feel like a civil war, pitting the old against the young. Tanya’s parents support Russia, even now. “We are Russian,” her father told her. Old people in Donetsk, like Tanya’s parents, are nostalgic about the Soviet Union, she told me. They are the welcoming committee that Vladimir Putin told Russians to expect when he ordered this invasion.But Tanya, like so many Russian speakers of her generation, sided with Ukraine. “People my age or younger,” she said, “they don’t want to go back.”Every Ukrainian I interviewed who grew up speaking Russian at home had a story like Tanya’s. Russian speakers, who make up roughly a quarter of Ukraine’s population, were favored during the Soviet era. But Tanya’s generation came of age as communism crumbled. They became Ukrainian in a way their parents never did. Volodymyr Zelensky — a Russian speaker young enough to be Mr. Putin’s son — is a prime example of this. He was elected Ukraine’s president with a wide majority, and many of his supporters wanted him to stop Russia from meddling in Ukraine’s affairs. He did so more boldly than any previous Ukrainian president had dared.*Tanya was born in Volnovakha, a town outside Donetsk, in 1978. She turned 11 the year the Berlin Wall fell and was 13 when Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly to break away from the Soviet Union. She says she was the first in her class to resign from the Pioneers, a Communist version of the Girl Scouts. She’d always hated the propaganda about “Grandpa Lenin” and the expectation that she should never let her brightness show. Back then, panties came in one color: beige. “If you wanted it black, you had to dye it,” she told me. The dye stained her mother’s midriff. Somehow, Tanya knew that better underwear was out there, even if she’d never seen it.She learned the Ukrainian language in college when she was 20. She’d always been told that it was the tongue of country bumpkins; educated people spoke Russian. Nonetheless, Tanya fell in love with it.But she didn’t actually feel Ukrainian until 2013 — at age 35 — when protests in Kyiv swept President Viktor Yanukovych from power after he backed out of a trade deal with the European Union. Tanya agreed with the protesters, but her parents were outraged that Mr. Yanukovych — a president they’d voted for — had been chased away by an unruly mob. They dismissed it as a coup that had been financed by the United States. They joined a protest in the city square. “Putin, come and help us,” they chanted.In 2014, her parents voted to break away from Ukraine and form the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, and the war in that region began. “I call it the Donetsk Retired People’s Republic,” Tanya told me, rolling her eyes. Pro-Russian separatists had been battling the Ukrainian Army over the city for months, when Tanya packed her car and moved to “Free Ukraine,” like nearly every other young person she knew. She eventually settled in Mariupol, a charming city by the sea that was home to some 400,000 people.Tanya fell in love with an American she’d met online and moved to the United States in 2020. Her sister took over her rented apartment. Then Tanya helped her buy a cozy house in the center of Mariupol, a block from City Hall. Tanya kept in close touch with her parents, too, although she avoided talking to them about politics. During the pandemic, her parents sent her videos from Donetsk, of their rooster and the apple trees, at the house where windows had once been shattered by a mine explosion during the years of conflict. The war over Donetsk seemed endless. Tanya’s parents blamed Ukraine, complaining that it was trying to kill them to avoid paying for their retirement.Nobody Tanya knew in Mariupol expected Russia to invade. They all thought the Russian troops amassing on the borders were a bluff. Tanya urged her sister to stock up on food, just in case. She watched the mayor of Mariupol encourage city residents to stand strong, as the Russians attacked. She heard from friends in Kyiv who were signing up to fight. She decided that she had to do something, so she collected supplies for Ukraine. A group called Sunflower of Peace gave her medicine. She bought more with her own money. She filled three huge suitcases with drone parts, insulin, painkillers, tourniquets and a brand of coagulant called BleedStop.ImageDemonstrators in Donetsk in 2014.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesWe landed in Warsaw on the eighth day of the war. A Polish man Tanya knew had agreed to drive her to the Ukrainian border, where she planned to hand off the supplies to a friend of a friend who would take them deeper into Ukraine. I wanted to go to the border, too, so I caught a ride.During the five-hour drive, Tanya sat in the back seat, lost in thought. She’d gotten a text from her sister, who had finally made it to a bomb shelter. But the shelter had no electricity and almost no food or water. Tanya’s sister and her sons had tried to leave to look for food, but a mine exploded right in front of them, forcing them to run back inside. One of the sons had hurt his leg. A few days later, Russian airstrikes destroyed a hospital maternity ward and, the following week, a theater where hundreds had taken shelter. A bomb left a giant crater near Tanya’s sister’s house. Mariupol was becoming a death trap.Tanya’s sister’s phone fell silent again. But Tanya’s parents still refused to blame Russia. Instead, they echoed Russian propaganda and said “Ukrainian Nazis” were killing their own people to whip up hatred against Russia.During the drive to the border, Tanya’s Polish friend told me that Mr. Putin was like a cornered rat — a dangerous thing.He conceded that Ukrainians had made some mistakes. They probably shouldn’t have passed a divisive law that reinforced Ukrainian as the sole state language. That had inflamed Russian speakers like Tanya's parents. And for too long, Ukrainian nationalism had rested on the likes of Stepan Bandera, a nationalist leader who tried to get Ukraine out from the grip of the Soviet Union by collaborating with Nazi Germany. A statue of Bandera had been erected in Lviv, fueling Russian propaganda that casts Ukraine’s government as “Nazis.” It didn’t help, either, that the Azov Battalion, a regiment with far-right fighters and origins, is among the defenders of Mariupol.But now, Ukrainians are more focused on their survival. Before the war, Tanya told me, about half of her friends could have lived happily under either Russia or Ukraine. Now, she said, none of them want Russia. Ukraine is solidifying as a country, even as it is being destroyed.We arrived at the Polish border town of Korczowa and searched for Oksana, the wife of a border guard, who made daily trips ferrying supplies from Poland into Ukraine. We waited for her at a shopping mall that had been turned into a welcome center for refugees. It was a surreal scene. Mannequins in fashionable clothes presided over rows of cots crowded with women who had fled with nothing but backpacks, children and pets. Tanya walked through the mall and burst into tears, thinking about her sister.Oksana arrived. She hugged Tanya and lit a cigarette with manicured nails.“Everything is OK,” she told Tanya, smiling. “They are fighting.” Kyiv was holding strong.Oksana thanked Tanya for the supplies. Then she listed other items that Ukrainians needed: flak jackets, walkie-talkies, thermal vision goggles, generators.ImageOksana, right, with Tanya, picking up supplies to take to Ukraine.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesThat night, Tanya and I parted ways. I went to another border checkpoint. She returned to Warsaw to find more supplies. She made three more trips to the border. Then she crossed over into Ukraine. I kept in touch with her and asked about her sister. Day after day, she had no word. The last she had heard was that her sister had joined a humanitarian convoy, but it had been turned back because of shooting.Tanya spoke with bitterness about city officials of Mariupol who posted sad-faced messages on Facebook from safe havens outside the country. I wondered how long the city could hold on.“To end this war, are there any compromises you would be willing to make?” I asked her in a text. “Should Zelensky give up Mariupol?”“Nope,” she replied. “If we compromise, we lose our sovereignty.” The war would only be postponed. This has “got to be our final battle,” she wrote back.On the 20th day of the war, Tanya finally got through on the phone to a man in Mariupol who was staying with her sister’s neighbor. She’d heard there would be a pause in the fighting to allow a humanitarian convoy out of the city. “Today is a good chance to escape,” Tanya told him. She asked him to tell her sister to leave right away. “Save their lives,” she pleaded.Tanya’s sister crammed her sons, her cat and another family from the bomb shelter into her Kia Ceed. Five days later, they arrived in western Ukraine, at a place that Tanya had arranged. Tanya hadn’t spoken to her parents in weeks. But on their mother’s birthday, she called home.“This is your birthday gift,” Tanya told her mother. “Your daughter and your grandsons survived.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

140,"Within days of the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the canceling and boycotting of Russian cultural events in Europe and North America began. Cultural organizations broke ties with Russian performers and artists. Two of the world’s most revered Russian musical artists — the conductor Valery Gergiev and the soprano Anna Netrebko — had their performances in multiple countries canceled. The repercussions have reached artists and works with no direct connection to President Vladimir Putin or his agenda, like the 20-year-old Russian pianist Alexander Malofeev, who had openly denounced the invasion, whose debut concert tour in Canada was called off. The Polish National Opera even canceled performances of Mussorgsky’s “Boris Godunov.” The list goes on.In the heat of this moment — as the depraved brutality of the unprovoked Russian invasion becomes more and more apparent — these high-profile retaliations against anyone and anything Russian may be understandable, but they are far from reasonable. Russian art, music, painting and film do not “belong” to the Russian state. In fact, there is no one “Russian culture” — there are many.It is profoundly ironic that those who react to the war in Ukraine by aggressively or indiscriminately canceling or restricting artists and artistic works simply for being Russian are reflecting the same kind of nationalist thinking driving the Russian invasion in the first place. Mr. Putin legitimates his war as an attempt to “save” Russians in Ukraine and reunite them with the Russian Federation. For him, there can be only one Russian culture and it can have only one homeland. Yet most Russians in Ukraine have no desire for Mr. Putin’s “salvation” — and a great many have taken up arms to resist it. They have a different homeland. Now that is a demonstration of a distinct Russian culture.In Mr. Putin’s view, the only place Russian identity and culture — like Russian people — are safe is under the Russian state — any territory in which Russians reside must therefore belong to the Russian Federation, and any Russian who rejects the “protection” of the Russian state is a national traitor. Ms. Netrebko herself is now being denounced as a traitor in the Russian Federation after making attempts to distance herself from Mr. Putin.Yet a spirit of resistance pulses through the work of many artists throughout the global diaspora who are creating art, music, film, literature and dance and who have been fleeing the Russian Federation at an increasing pace since the invasion and occupation of Crimea in 2014. They include the poet and publisher Dmitry Kuzmin, who begins one of his poems:Recent data from a sociological survey:88 percent of the population of my country — are fascists.Mr. Kuzmin resettled in Latvia in 2015 in order to write Russian poetry at a safe distance from Mr. Putin and his state. His Russian culture is certainly not Mr. Putin’s. It is both more peaceful and humane.The idea of discrete national cultures, conducted in distinct languages and associated with states and their “proper territories” — French culture in France, German culture in Germany — is associated with the rising tide of ethnic nationalist ideology of the 19th century. Even then, this idea didn’t correspond to reality. The forces of migration — as well as the more destructive means of war, conquest and colonialism — have insured the mingling of people, languages and cultures throughout history. Borders between territories associated with one or another language or ethnic group have shifted over and over again, and so have the cultures they created.This is also true in terms of simple geography. The Russian diaspora includes large communities of people of Russian heritage in several countries across the globe — millions of them in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan; in the Baltic States, especially in Estonia and Latvia; in Israel, the United States, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Australia; and, of course, in Ukraine.Movements like the voluntary migration of over one million Russian-speaking Jews from the former Soviet Union to Israel in the 1990s, for instance, and refugee crises like the current displacement of more than five million people from Ukraine, continue to blur these borders. Russian speakers in Israel create their own Russian culture. As do Russian speakers in the Baltic States, and in Ukraine.Russia’s literary history is replete with examples of authors who have written powerful works of protest, at a far remove from “Russian national culture.” Osip Mandelstam, a Russian poet of Jewish origins who defined his own brand of poetry, Acmeism, as a “yearning for world culture,” died in the Soviet penal camp system in 1938 as a result of an epigram caricaturing Stalin and his cruelty. He is only one of many.Today, the poet Shamshad Abdullaev, an ethnic Uzbek from the city of Fergana in Uzbekistan, writes experimental poetry in Russian, rising out of Central Asian landscapes, but inspired by European avant-garde traditions, like this passage from his poem, “End of the Week: A Walk With a Friend”:So we came out on the pockmarked square — so broadthe path traversed is clear, but the rough curveof the clay-walled street with its sour-green moss coverand the dirty windblast that overtakes usfrom the blind alley, as always, from behind,have silenced the epic scrim, like Paris,seen by Rousseau for the first timein its greasy, squawking grayness.Abdullaev has won poetry prizes and fellowships in Russia, Germany, Italy, the United States and elsewhere. His work addresses audiences across the world. Both intensely local and emphatically global, his writing in Russian bears no relation to the Russian state or the territories it seeks to claim.Or consider this passage from a poem written last month by Boris Khersonsky, a Jewish poet from Odesa who writes mainly in Russian. This poem, whose title I’ve translated as “As in a Game of Battleship, Their Victory Is on Paper,” was posted on Facebook:You’ve shed our blood. Smeared yourself with blood.You’d do better to keep count of your own brood.Freely tossing men, like logs, in the conflagration.You won’t wash the blood stains from your mad generation.Khersonsky, of course, might best be described as a Ukrainian poet. Yet his poetry forms part of a distinctive Russian culture. That is the crux of the matter.That the world should be amplifying Ukrainian art and culture is clear. This is of the highest priority. Yet support for Ukrainian culture does not entail canceling Russian culture. To adopt such a stance is to support a world of pernicious national antagonisms and closed borders. That is precisely the world that Mr. Putin seeks to create with his war. We, along with right-minded Russians, should be working to resist the reactive canceling of Russian artists and performances, rather than playing along.Kevin M. F.

141,"LUBLIN, Poland — On a recent morning, I sat in the sun-filled dining room of a tidy house in eastern Poland, across from one of the most generous men I’ve ever met.He was a Polish apple farmer who took in eight Ukrainian refugees, all complete strangers, and gave them a place to stay, cooked them meals, brought them armloads of fresh bread every morning and has been trying to find them jobs.But when it came to talking about World War II, this is what he said: “The real disaster started when the Russians invaded. The Russians were worse than the Germans.”“The Germans,” he said, “did not hurt ordinary people.”ImageThe ruins of a Jewish cemetery, in Przemysl, a town one-third Jewish before World War II. Now, there are six Jewish families left.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesMy first reaction fell somewhere between disappointment and silent outrage: How could this farmer be so kind and so blind? How could he say the Germans didn’t hurt “ordinary people” when they murdered millions of Jews right here in Poland? The biggest death camps were in Poland, and the more I thought about it, the more I was shocked by what the farmer said. I don’t want to include his name, because my point is not to shame him over an offhand comment, a few words in an hourlong interview, but to share my intense reaction to it.But then I realized he and I were actually engaging in a similar type of thinking.He couldn’t stop obsessing about Russia, which occupied Poland during World War II and controlled it for many decades afterward, and is now dropping bombs just a few miles from the border. And I couldn’t stop thinking about the Holocaust. Neither of us had lived through all that history ourselves — the trauma was handed down to us from our families — but both of us were trapped in the past.I think that’s the hardest aspect of covering the war in Ukraine and its spillover effect across the region: how to integrate the past with the present.For Jews like me, whose ancestors come from Eastern Europe, we feel especially yanked back and forth because the most searing event in our collective histories, the Holocaust, happened exactly where the news is unfolding today.ImageJews being carted off from the Warsaw Ghetto in 1941.Credit...Universal History Archive, via Getty ImagesJews were wiped out during World War II in the same places as in today’s headlines: Lviv, Warsaw, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, the list goes on. Countless Ukrainians and Poles helped the Nazis; some did take brave steps to save Jews. But even after the war ended and the Nazis left, Polish mobs killed Jews. Those are facts.Yet now Ukraine is rallying around a Jewish president. The nation’s spirited resistance against a powerful invader has inspired people around the world. The Poles have also done something truly remarkable: absorbing more than two million refugees in less than two months, and they haven’t stuck them in grim camps but instead have taken them into their own homes. Those are facts, too.How should we reconcile them?I asked the writer Daniel Mendelsohn, author of a profoundly moving book called “The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million,” about his quest to discover what happened to relatives who disappeared during the Holocaust from Ukraine, a place where the Nazis found many eager collaborators and where many Jews were massacred in pogroms during czarist times.“The feeling you’re talking about is one I know well,” he said. “When I was growing up the refrain was: The Germans were bad, the Poles were worse, and the Ukrainians were the worst. And now look. Whoever thought we’d be rooting for the Ukrainians?”What’s important, he said, is allowing yourself to update deeply felt beliefs.ImageA woman exiting a building underneath an indentation that would have held a mezuzah, signifying that Jews had lived there, in Lviv, Ukraine, in 2001.

The earth spins on its axis. And hopefully a new world emerges.”I don’t doubt the apple farmer is a good person, but the ghosts he stirred in that room trailed after me.When I toured a museum in Przemysl, a beautiful little city with a blood-soaked history right on the border of Poland and Ukraine, I found myself unable to pull my eyes from a photograph of the Jewish Ghetto there: two Nazi soldiers pinning an old Jewish man against a wall and cutting off his beard, a small but deeply humiliating act.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.I’d been steeped in the broader story my entire life. I learned it from my family, in Hebrew school, at temple. Remembrance of the Holocaust is part of our culture. But this was my first time in Poland, and it’s something entirely different to stand in the same place where all these innocent people were killed and allow yourself to really think about it. It made me lightheaded and nauseated.The director of the museum, giving me a tour, could tell I was upset.“This town used to be a third Jewish,” he said.How many are left?“Six families,” he said.ImageNazi soldiers cutting off the beard of a Jew to humiliate him, in a photo provided by the National Museum of the Przemysl Land.Credit...National Museum of Przemysl LandI left that museum almost broken, overwhelmed with grief for people I didn’t know. The feeling was paralyzing, big and shapeless.For the rest of my time in Poland, I traveled through a landscape filled with vivid memories that belonged to others. I passed snowbound villages with frozen lakes and little wooden houses that thrust me back into the pages of one of the most unforgettable books I’ve ever read, “The Painted Bird” by Jerzy Kosinski.As I stood in the bitter cold outside Przemysl’s train station, watching crowds of refugees drift off a train from Lviv, exhausted, lost and hungry, I couldn’t stop thinking of “Everything Is Illuminated,” an exquisitely written novel whose plot begins at Lviv’s train station.I asked its author, Jonathan Safran Foer, who, like Mr. Mendelsohn, wrote about going back to Ukraine in a quest for his roots: What do you feel about this whole crisis?“I feel guilt,” he said, explaining that while his grandmother’s family was murdered in Ukraine, his grandfather was sheltered in secret, at great risk, by a Ukrainian family.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the bravery and goodness of that Ukrainian family,” Mr. Foer said.And so he asks himself, without a good answer: “Am I not doing for them what they did for me?”ImageA group of Jews held at gunpoint by German SS troops after being forced out of a bunker where they had been sheltering in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. Credit...Hulton Archive, via Getty ImagesThen he added, quietly: “If I’d said to my grandmother that the president of Ukraine is Jewish, it’s hard to imagine anything that would have been more surprising to her.”In so many dimensions of this war, the past infuses the present. President Vladimir V. Putin says he invaded Ukraine to “de-Nazify” it, which is false, but during World War II many Ukrainian nationalists did back the Nazis.Some of Russia’s biggest oligarchs are Jews who have helped both Israel and Mr. Putin. Israel itself is trying to maintain a tenuous balance between sympathy for Ukrainians and its security concerns in Syria, whose government Russia props up.It’s a lot to get one’s head around. After I sent a Polish carpenter friend, Marek Sawicki, a message from Przemysl, telling him how charmed I had been by the culture, the food and the overwhelming hospitality extended toward Ukrainian refugees, he wrote back: “Even I am surprised. There was bad blood between Poles and Ukrainians for centuries.”Perhaps Poland is looking for redemption, he implied.ImageAn empty tram bearing a Star of David ran through the streets of Warsaw in January to commemorate the Jews murdered in the Holocaust.

He never looked back.I see the value in that, but it’s a hard line to walk, cognitively and emotionally.We shouldn’t forget what happened and, for some of us, even distantly connected to the events of the past, we simply can’t.But the Ukraine of today and the Poland of today are not the Ukraine or Poland of the Holocaust.And perhaps that’s one of the greatest lessons of this awful war.

143,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had charged a Russian oligarch with violating U.S. sanctions and unveiled additional measures intended to counter Russian money laundering and disrupt online criminal networks in an effort to enforce financial penalties on Moscow.The moves came as the United States has ratcheted up pressure on the Kremlin and some of the wealthiest Russians in light of growing evidence of atrocities in Ukraine and as Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the United States was helping its European partners investigate potential war crimes.The oligarch, Konstantin Malofeev, 47, is widely considered one of Russia’s most influential business moguls — he is said to have deep ties to President Vladimir V. Putin — and is among the more prominent conservatives in the country’s Kremlin-allied elite. (The indictment renders his surname as Malofeyev.)The actions demonstrated the reach of a task force created last month to find and seize the assets of wealthy Russians who violate U.S. sanctions on Russia, and the penalties appeared meant to enforce the far-reaching economic sanctions that the United States has imposed along with European allies.“The Justice Department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots and hold you accountable,” Mr. Garland said, adding that officials had moved “to prosecute criminal Russian activity.” He pointed to the seizure this week of a $90 million yacht owned by Viktor F. Vekselberg, who was previously targeted with sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Garland said law enforcement was also pursuing Mr. Malofeev for illegally transferring money in violation of sanctions.The criminal charges against Mr. Malofeev, which were unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, follow an indictment filed there in March against a former Fox News employee, John Hanick. Mr. Hanick, an American citizen, is accused of working for the oligarch from 2013 to 2017, and was arrested in February in London.Justice Department officials said in a statement on Wednesday that the charges against Mr. Malofeev were in connection with his hiring of Mr. Hanick “to work for him in operating television networks in Russia and Greece and attempting to acquire a television network in Bulgaria.”The U.S. Treasury Department, in imposing sanctions on Mr. Malofeev in December 2014, called him “one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea.”Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement on Wednesday that the sanctions barred Mr. Malofeev from paying or receiving services from American citizens, or from conducting transactions with his property in the United States.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The department said that it believed the market accounted for 80 percent of cryptocurrency transactions on the dark web, and that roughly $5.2 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had been seized with help from German authorities.The announcement came in tandem with new sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies on Wednesday targeting some of Russia’s largest banks.Zach Montague reported from Washington, and Benjamin Weiser from New York.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/justice-department-russian-oligarch-charged.html
144,"The Pentagon is sending an additional $800 million in defense aid to Ukraine that effectively will create five new Ukrainian artillery battalions, and includes more than 120 new drones built specifically for use by Ukraine’s forces. Officials made the announcement in a statement sent to reporters Thursday morning.Shortly afterward, two senior defense officials described to reporters the efforts by the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, to move as many weapons as possible from American stockpiles to the border of Ukraine.Representatives from 14 nations, including Ukraine, have posted liaison officers to a task force in Stuttgart that takes requests from the government in Kyiv and arranges for weapons and supplies from different countries to be delivered, said one of the officials, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the effort to arm Ukraine against Russia.The existence of the task force, called European Command Control Center Ukraine, has not previously been disclosed.The new drone that will soon head to the region, called Phoenix Ghost, is a previously-unknown design that “was developed rapidly by the Air Force” after discussions with Ukrainian troops about what kinds of weapons they need, the second official said.It is roughly similar to the Switchblade drone already being sent to Ukraine, in that it is capable of surveillance but ultimately used to crash into a target and explode on impact, the officials said. Such “tactical drones” are useful in destroying high-value targets because they fly directly into them.“It provides the same sort of tactical capability that Switchblade does,” the second official said. “It is clearly designed to deliver a punch.”For the expected battle between large Ukrainian and Russian forces over the Donbas region, the United States is providing a significant new flush of artillery weapons: dozens of 155-millimeter howitzers.Five new Ukrainian artillery battalions will be outfitted, each with 18 guns and nearly 37,000 rounds. Weapons of this type can generally fire three to five times per minute, according to military documents, striking targets about 25 miles away with 90-pound shells.The howitzers, which have to be towed into position and then can be moved again after firing, are able to maintain a steady stream of fire that can be used to force Russian forces to duck into trenches while Ukrainian infantry troops advance.“We think it could have significant additional firepower for the Ukrainians,” one of the senior defense officials said. “If we didn’t believe that, we wouldn’t have moved forward with that many howitzers and that many more rounds.”The decision was made, the official said, in consultation with the Ukrainian military.“We think it will be a significant contributor, and a meaningful contributor to their ability to continue to defend themselves in the Donbas,” the official added.Some of the first batch of 18 howitzers have already arrived in Ukraine, having been drawn from U.S. Army and Marine Corps inventories in the United States, the Pentagon said.Additional howitzers will arrive over the weekend, when more than 50 Ukrainian artillery soldiers are expected to complete their training on the new American guns at an undisclosed location outside their country, and then return to the fight against the Russians.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/world/europe/us-weapons-ukraine.html
145,"The mass flight of refugees from Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis that dwarfs anything Europe has seen since World War II. More than four million people have poured into neighboring countries, and as long as Russia’s savage war continues, millions more will flee. Already, the flow of refugees from Ukraine is far greater than the number from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq who fled to Europe in 2015, upending European politics.Europe’s initial reaction to the flight from Ukraine has been an impressive show of solidarity, given how suddenly the crisis exploded. Refugees, most of whom are women and children, because most men are required to stay behind in Ukraine to fight, have been welcomed and housed even as their numbers swell.But the scale of this crisis is staggering, and it is still in its early stages. Coping with it will demand more coordination, imagination, funds and determination both within Europe and by the United States and allies elsewhere. Existing refugee centers should receive far more assistance, and ways need to be found to encourage refugees to move on to countries that have more capacity to host them. Preparations should also be made now to help Ukrainians return home, should a lasting peace eventually take hold.Opening the doors wide to European refugees raises an inevitable comparison to the treatment of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and other countries. About 16,000 people remain in refugee camps in Greece, and many of them are going hungry because they lack the same rights that are being guaranteed to Ukrainians. But the answer to a double standard cannot be to close the doors to Ukrainians.To put it in perspective, close to one million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek refuge in Europe in one year, 2015. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, nearly one million people have left Ukraine every week. Barring a peace agreement, Russia will keep bombarding civilian infrastructure. Ukraine will keep fighting for its survival. Ten million people — roughly a quarter of the population of Ukraine — could end up leaving the country in the coming months.Cities in Poland, Moldova and Romania have been transformed, putting pressure on schools, housing, hospitals and government assistance programs. Warsaw, a city of about 1.6 million people, is now hosting more than 300,000 Ukrainian refugees, many of whom are sleeping in hastily set up welcome centers. Overcrowded shelters for women and children are targets for human trafficking and criminal exploitation.Refugees are not a design flaw of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian infrastructure is part of a broader strategy to demoralize the civilian population and drive residents into neighboring countries, where their presence can be destabilizing. This became clear during last year’s episode on the Belarus-Poland border, after Aleksandr Lukashenko, the autocratic ruler of Belarus, apparently manufactured a crisis by encouraging migrants to cross into Poland.Over time, resentment of Ukrainian refugees may grow. People who started off welcoming the refugees could turn against them, putting pressure on their governments to force Ukraine to end the war on Russia’s terms. Easing this pressure, by supporting the countries that are hosting refugees, makes this tactic of trying to weaponize refugees less effective.The Council of the European Union has already taken an important step by passing a directive that grants temporary protected status to Ukrainian nationals and certain legal permanent residents of Ukraine for up to one year. Most Ukrainians already had the right to travel without visas to European Union countries for 90 days. The new measure gives them the right to live, work and attend school in E.U. countries without having to go through the official process of seeking asylum.But far more needs to be done to assist the places where refugees are clustered, and to help refugees find their way out of overcrowded welcome centers. Britain’s “Homes for Ukraine” program, which pays families and organizations to take in refugees, has resulted in the issuing of 2,700 visas so far, while Finland has offered spots in universities to 2,000 Ukrainians.These ad hoc efforts are important but insufficient given the millions of people who are affected. The European Union has established a platform to match offers of help with those in need. Seven countries, including Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, have pledged to take in some 15,000 of the Ukrainians now in Moldova. But that’s a small fraction of the estimated 98,000 Ukrainians in Moldova, many of whom are reluctant to leave because a language they know, Russian, is spoken there.The European Union has also identified roughly 17 billion euros in funds for pandemic recovery and programs to promote social and economic cohesion that could be immediately spent on urgent needs, including housing, education, health care and child care. An E.U. proposal to address the current crisis would distribute more of those funds to countries hosting large numbers of refugees. Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia would receive 45 percent more funding than they would have gotten. Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Estonia — member states that have received the highest number of Ukrainians in proportion to their national populations — would get that increase as well.Efforts to humanely accommodate those displaced by the war need not be confined to Europe. Canada, which is home to a large Ukrainian population, has agreed to welcome an unlimited number of people fleeing the war to stay for up to three years. Even Japan, which has long been reluctant to take in refugees, has agreed to accept Ukrainians.President Biden’s announcement that the United States would accept up to 100,000 is a good start, but the country can do more, especially when public support for welcoming Ukrainian refugees is strong. The United States has been a key player in Ukraine over the years, from encouraging Ukrainians to stand up to Russia to persuading Ukrainians to agree to the removal of nuclear weapons from their territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union, a decision that many Ukrainians deeply regret today.As the world enters a period of greater instability, its leaders can no longer ignore the need for a coordinated and humane response to all of those fleeing war and other desperate circumstances.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

146,"A few weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, Valerie Glodan wrote in a post on Instagram that she was living with “a new level of happiness” after she gave birth to her first child.“Our girl is one month old now,” she wrote in the post, showing a photograph taken in late pregnancy. “It has been the best 40 weeks.”But the chapter ended in tragedy on Saturday when Ms. Glodan, 27, was killed with her 3-month-old daughter, Kira, after a missile hit a residential area on the outskirts of the Black Sea port of Odesa, where they were staying. They had just moved in with Ms. Glodan’s mother, who was also killed in the attack.The Instagram post and the violent death of a newborn broke through the daily reports of Russian attacks, whose randomness has caught many civilians — unable to flee or refusing to do so — in the middle.“The war started when this baby was one month old. Can you imagine what is happening?” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said, in tears, at a news conference a few hours after the attack.Five others were also killed when two cruise missiles hit the residential neighborhood in the Tairove district in the far western corner of the city and the number is set to rise given the extent of the damage, Ukrainian officials said. Photographs and video appeared to show extensive damage.Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, reacted with anger on Twitter, saying the only objective of Russian missile strikes in Odesa is terror.One of Ms. Glodan’s closest friends, Oleksandra Iliashenko, said she was “filled with emptiness.” Ms. Glodan was “a bright light, full of life,” she said and added: “She gave me hope for our future.”A few weeks earlier, Ms. Glodan had called Ms. Iliashenko to tell her that she was starting to feel uneasy about the mounting violence. She said she had moved her family from their high-rise apartment, close to Odesa’s airport, to her mother’s home in the Tairove district, which is further from the city center.The two friends talked and agreed that if the apartment the family abandoned was hit, it would be time to leave Odesa. Instead, the mother’s home was destroyed.The two women met while studying journalism at the University of Odesa, and since then their lives ran in tandem. After college they started their first jobs at the same time and found husbands who became good friends. They bought neighboring apartments and were always rotating through each other’s front doors, planning parties, exchanging pets, looking after plants and later, children.“We were planning on raising our families together. She was always telling me that we were in our prime, with such amazing opportunities ­— she believed we had great lives,” Ms. Iliashenko said, between sobs. She spoke in a phone interview from Warsaw, where she has been staying for the past few weeks.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

I admired her very much,” Ms. Iliashenko said.In the weeks following the invasion, the two friends told each other they doubted the war would come to Odesa, and they believed the conflict would be over in three weeks, Ms. Iliashenko said. They tried to distract each other by cooking meals together and dreaming up vacations their families could take when the war ended.Ms. Glodan’s husband, Uri, who survived the attack, was around the corner at a shop when the missile struck, Ms. Iliashenko said.Mr. Glodan, a well-known Odesa baker, had spent the lead-up to the Orthodox Easter weekend making cakes for sale, decorated in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. On Sunday, he posted a series of photos to his Instagram account, commemorating his wife, daughter and mother-in-law. “My dear ones,” he wrote under the images. “You are in our hearts!”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/mother-baby-odesa-missile-attack.html
147,"WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India not to increase his country’s reliance on Russian oil and gas, officials said, part of a global effort by the United States to maintain economic pressure on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.Mr. Biden also emphasized growing defense cooperation with India in a virtual meeting with Mr. Modi — a line U.S. officials have increasingly highlighted in the hopes of convincing New Delhi to come off the fence over Russia’s invasion.In the meeting between the two leaders, Mr. Biden offered to help Mr. Modi acquire oil and other energy from other sources. The United States and its allies have been working for months to deprive President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of the financial resources generated from the sale of oil and gas around the world.But Mr. Biden stopped well short of pressuring India to stop buying Russian oil, which amounts to about 1 percent of its imports. And American officials said the president did not ask India to condemn Russia by name for the brutal military campaign against its neighbor, a step that India has been unwilling to take since the beginning of the invasion.“The president made clear that he does not believe it’s in India’s interest to accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy and other commodities,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters after the leaders’ meeting, which lasted about an hour.On Monday, Mr. Modi again declined to single out Russia by name even as he condemned the apparent human rights abuses in Bucha, which the United States and others have said are evidence of war crimes.“The news about the killings of innocent civilians in the Bucha city was very worrying,” Mr. Modi said in public remarks at the beginning of his meeting with Mr. Biden. He did not attribute the killings to Russia, but said that “we instantly condemned the killings and have called for an independent inquiry.”India has long been reliant on Russia for military hardware, an important factor in the deep historic ties between the two countries. And so despite global condemnations of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Mr. Modi’s administration has tried to remain neutral — refraining from criticizing Russia, while calling for negotiations and engaging Ukraine with humanitarian assistance.While American officials have been understanding of the complexity of India’s balancing act, seeing New Delhi as an important ally in the face of an assertive China, they have at times expressed frustration that India’s stance is offering Mr. Putin some cover. Some U.S. officials have warned of consequences if India expands trade with Russia, especially any increase in purchasing oil, as the West tries to tighten sanctions.ImageDemonstrators gathered outside the White House last weekend.Credit...Kenny Holston for The New York TimesIndia is emblematic of the challenge facing Mr. Biden and other Western allies as they seek to expand the coalition of nations willing to punish Mr. Putin for his actions. The president has said global unity behind economic sanctions is the key to forcing the Russian leader to abandon what Mr. Biden calls his “war of choice” in Ukraine.But while the United States has had success rallying more than 50 nations, including much of Europe, behind that strategy, India and other countries around the world have held back. India abstained when the United Nations voted to condemn the invasion in March, and again when the U.N. ejected Russia from the organization’s Human Rights Council.That was not a surprise to Biden administration officials, according to longtime observers of India’s relations with other countries. Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the meeting on Monday underscored the careful American approach to relations with India over the past several decades.“They understand that forcing India to make a choice is not likely to be effective and might even be counterproductive,” she said. “And so, I think I’ve seen them talk about enabling India to make choices rather than forcing India to make choices. And so they don’t talk about it publicly as choosing camps.”That frustrates some inside and outside the administration, who believe that India, the world’s largest democracy, and other countries should be more assertive in defending the principles of national borders.And India’s determination to stay neutral in a conflict that is roiling Europe and much of the rest of the world is likely to be an irritant in the group known as the Quad — the United States, Australia, Japan and India — whose other nations have firmly condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, said the issue highlighted the differences among the four nations even as the group professes to come together around a set of common values.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“The Quad is really about maintaining a rules-based order, and one sovereign country, in Russia, invading and destroying another sovereign country, in Ukraine, is completely contrary to a rules-based order,” he said. “And so, that’s going make future Quad meetings — and we’re going to see them later this year — a bit awkward and a bit chilly.”But both Mr. Grossman and Ms. Madan praised Mr. Biden and his administration for trying to deal delicately with India. Ms. Madan said there was little to be gained for the United States to try to exert too much pressure on countries that have their own domestic realities.“You want to try to attract as many people to your positions,” she said, “but also recognizing that there will be a group of countries that will not necessarily be as like-minded as you.”“The next best thing is to try to continue your efforts to kind of align them with you,” she added, “but if not, keep them nonaligned.”As part of that effort, Mr. Biden on Monday echoed sentiments that other U.S. officials have expressed in recent weeks in attempts to reassure India that its source of military hardware would not run dry if it took a firmer stance against Russia.“We share a strong and growing major defense partnership,” the president said in his opening remarks, before the defense and foreign ministers of both countries sat for extended dialogue. “The United States and India will continue our close consultations on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.”India’s defense purchases from the United States have increased over the past decade to about $20 billion. But analysts have said expanding the ties to the point where India’s dependency on Russian military hardware would wane would take time. That would require overcoming deeply rooted hesitancy in the relationship between the United States and India that dates back decades.In his remarks, Mr. Modi continued India’s delicate line on Ukraine — expressing concern about the suffering caused by the war but refraining from calling out Russia as the aggressor.“Our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying,” Mr. Modi said. “During this entire process I spoke several times to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia. I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested there be direct talks between President Putin and the president of Ukraine.”Michael D.

Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesArming UkraineAs Russian forces regroup for a new offensive in the east, the U.S. and other NATO countries are searching for ways to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine. President Biden told President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call today that the U.S. would send an additional $800 million worth of military and other security aid, including “new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”Biden also said the U.S. would “transfer” additional helicopters — though he did not indicate whether they would come directly from the U.S. or another country. He said his administration would “continue to facilitate” the transfer of other weapons systems from allied countries to Ukraine to help in the fight.Last week, Slovakia agreed to send Ukraine a Soviet-era S-300 air defense system after the U.S. agreed to position a more modern Patriot system in Slovakia.The Pentagon separately hosted a meeting with leaders from the top eight U.S. arms manufacturers to discuss sending more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine and to eventually restock supplies if needed. Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Raytheon Company, two of the firms at the meeting, together make the Javelin anti-tank weapons, and Raytheon makes the Stinger antiaircraft weapon, both of which the U.S. has supplied to Ukraine. The U.S. has also increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine about Russian forces in the Donbas and Crimea, officials said. The information could allow the Ukrainians to conduct more effective counterattacks against Russian forces in the Donbas or Crimea, or better predict the movement of Russian troops from those areas against Ukrainian forces.Writing in The Atlantic, Eliot Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, argued that the U.S. and its allies could tip the balance in favor of Ukraine with weapons and advisers on the ground. He wrote that President Vladimir Putin of Russia “will order offensives that, if confronted by a well-resourced Ukrainian foe, can effectively destroy his own army.

And even a speedy application process could take a year, leaving both nonaligned nations vulnerable in the interim, so NATO members are already discussing security guarantees for the prospective members.Unlike Sweden, Finland shares a long border with Russia, which ruled it for most of the 19th century.

Thousands more flew to Georgia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries that accept Russian citizens without visas.Some left Russia because they objected to the war or feared that they could not speak their minds if they stayed. Working in tech, they had enough money to flee and could continue their work from anywhere with a laptop and an internet connection.Others left because their companies pulled them out.Tech is a small part of the Russian economy compared with the energy and metals industries but has been growing rapidly.

149,"DNIPRO, Ukraine — Under incessant fire from the air and with Russian troops closing in, a group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the besieged city of Mariupol issued a message of despair on Tuesday evening, expressing hope that their own forces would come to their rescue and demanding that the world do something to stop the Kremlin’s vicious war.“We’re surrounded; they’re bombing us with everything they can,” said a Ukrainian soldier who gave his name as Gasim. “Our only plan is for the blockade to be broken by our forces so that we can get out of here.”Gasim and his comrades reached out to a reporter near midnight as Russian forces continued their bombardment of a sprawling Soviet-era steel mill with underground bunkers that is sheltering thousands of soldiers and civilians. While Gasim and the others would not confirm that they were in the mill, the Azovstal steel plant, officials said that this was where the last Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol had taken refuge as Russia’s battle to take full control of the city appeared to be entering its final stages.The soldiers spoke by video chat on WhatsApp, offering a rare glimpse of a battlefield that has transfixed the world. The men often spoke over one another, the light of the phone occasionally bringing their faces into focus in the otherwise pitch-black darkness. They seemed unaware of the attention their fight had attracted and refused to divulge basic details about the number of troops and their locations that the Ukrainian authorities had already described.The holdouts in the underground fortress represent the last stand of a strategic city that has endured a relentless siege by Russian forces. The remaining defenders’ ordeal has captured global attention as they have held off the enemy for weeks, in what has been likened to a Ukrainian Alamo.With ammunition and supplies sparse, the men who were interviewed said they were carrying on the fight and refusing to acquiesce to the Kremlin’s demand’s for capitulation. But they acknowledged that they were running out of time and increasingly found it difficult to leave the protection of their shelter because of the heavy bombing.“We are putting up a difficult fight with the enemy, protecting our country and our people and our culture, our right to self-determination,” another soldier who gave his name as Kostya said, even as he acknowledged they had little to fight with.“As we’re talking to you, they’re firing on us from the air, dropping bombs,” Gasim said. “Tell America to help us.”After about 15 minutes, the video cut out and further attempts to reach the men were unsuccessful.The interviews came as Russian forces bombarded the plant with a heavy barrage of airstrikes and mortar rounds, as well as naval artillery fire from ships on the Sea of Azov.The Azovstal plant where the men are likely sheltered makes for a formidable fortress, an immense industrial complex of thick concrete and walls, steel doors and reinforced underground warrens. Yan Gagin, who identified himself as a Russian adviser in the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-declared government in eastern Ukraine backed by the Kremlin, said in a broadcast report that the steel factory was designed to withstand a nuclear war.“It is basically a city under a city,” he said, conceding that the Russian campaign to seize the plant had been significantly hampered by the sophisticated network of passages, rooms and communication systems connecting the basement levels of the plant. window.registerInteractive && window.registerInteractive(""100000008310557"");

Russian troop positions from Institute for the Study of War with American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project. Note: Russian-controlled areas represent territory that Russian forces are able to operate freely in, without immediate risk of Ukrainian counterattacks, as assessed by the Institute for the Study of War on April 18. Areas of Russian advances indicate where Russian troops were seen.By Scott ReinhardFrederick W. Kagan, director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, said, “I assume the Russians are going to throw everything they have at this, to eliminate this pocket,” but he added that doing so could cost them dearly. “You’d be surprised at how well people can survive big bombs in a facility like that,” he said.A spokeswoman for Metinvest, the company that owns the mill, said that the bunkers beneath it were used as shelters by steelworkers in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists tried to seize Mariupol.“Ever since the first invasion, we’ve kept the bunkers in good order and supplied with food and water,” said Galina Yatsura, who heads international communications for Metinvest, adding that the shelters can house up to 4,000 people and are stocked with enough food and water to last three weeks.Two employees who stayed at the plant in the early days of the siege said that more than 2,000 civilians had been staying there, many of them family members of employees.Russia’s Defense Ministry called a cease-fire for Wednesday in the area of the plant to allow civilians to leave, the Russian state news media reported. However, previous attempts to suspend fighting have fallen through.The plant stretches across four square miles, a complex of buildings, smokestacks, blast furnaces and stacks of coiled and plate steel, and it has its own port facilities on the Sea of Azov.One of the largest metal mills in Europe, it produced about 4.3 million tons of steel annually before the Russian invasion, according to Metinvest, a steel and mining conglomerate owned by Ukraine’s richest man, the billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.The network of underground passages and rooms, which is now pivotal to the survival of the holed-up soldiers and civilians, was originally built to transport equipment between buildings, according to Metinvest. There was no planned military use for the tunnels before the war, the company said.The steel mill has been under heavy bombardment, a Ukrainian commander, Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko, said Monday in a video recorded at the factory. “They use free-fall bombs, rockets, bunker-buster bombs, all varieties of artillery, both ground and naval for indiscriminate attacks,” he said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.The Russians are trying to establish uncontested control of territory linking the separatist-held regions of Donbas, in southeastern Ukraine, to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014. The holdouts in Mariupol are the last substantial obstacle left in the region.Russian forces have had the city, a major port, under siege since last month, bombarding much of it to rubble and slowly tightening their grip.The fight over the Azovstal steel plant recalls one of the great struggles of the Second World War, the battle for the Stalingrad Tractor Factory as Nazi Germany’s forces attempted to capture that city. Thousands of German and Soviet soldiers died there, as did many civilians, before the Soviets ultimately prevailed.“We’ve seen this movie before,” Mr. Kagan said. “Anytime you’re dealing with a sprawling, heavy industrial complex, it’s going to make a good fighting position for defenders.”Ukraine’s intelligence service wrote in a statement on Monday that the Russians were preparing to use three-ton bombs on the plant in an effort to raze it completely. Moscow is “not deterred by the fact that civilians have taken refuge in the plant,” the service said in a statement.The plant was first established by the Soviet Union in the 1930s and rebuilt following World War II. It is a labyrinth of rail systems, workshops, blast furnaces and warehouses, with many of the buildings made of thick concrete and designed to withstand high temperatures.If Russia succeeds in flattening the complex’s buildings, it is not clear how many people hunkered underground might survive. Eventually, though, they would run out of provisions, and the Ukrainians have warned repeatedly that the Russians might use chemical weapons to force them out or kill them.In the confusion of the siege, it was difficult to get a clear picture of what was happening inside the factory. But according to Ms. Yatsura, a number of employees remain there. They had stayed after the invasion began to prepare the complex’s bomb shelters and eliminate hazardous materials.Clearing the plant could hold particular symbolic value for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has justified his invasion with the false claim that Ukraine is run by Nazis, and that he is rooting them out. The plant’s defenders include members of the Azov Battalion, a force that does include far-right soldiers, some of them foreign, including white supremacists and people who have been described as fascists.Capturing the Azovstal plant would also give the Russians better access to the region’s railway system and seaport.How long the Ukrainian defenders can stave off the Russian invaders there will depend in large part on how many people are inside and how well sustained they are. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an aide to Mayor Vadym Boychenko of Mariupol, said the Ukrainian Army had arranged two operations over the past two weeks to take food to the plant; he did not say how that was accomplished. But the situation will probably grow more dire, he said, as Russian troops have blocked anyone, including civilians, from entering or leaving the city.“These people, many wanted to avoid being displaced or deported, so they found protection with our troops, in the basement of the plant,” said Mr. Andryushchenko, who, like the mayor, left the city weeks ago.The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its forces had completely surrounded the steel plant, and that the Ukrainian forces holding out “forbade negotiations about surrendering,” citing an intercepted radio transmission.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/mariupol-azovstal-steel-plant.html

Since the start of the war, churches have shrouded religious statues in protective wrapping and have boarded up stained glass windows.Russia, which is also predominantly Eastern Orthodox, rejected calls this week by Ukraine and the United Nations for an Easter cease-fire.Though most Ukrainians and Russians are Orthodox Christians, long-simmering tensions between church leaders in the two nations have deepened in recent years. In 2019, the church in Ukraine, which had been subordinate to Moscow since 1686, was granted its independence.ImageMembers of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces holding Easter sweet bread near their trenches in a forest defensive position on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, on Saturday.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesThis week Russian airstrikes killed at least seven people in Lviv, but the city has been spared most of the fighting raging in the east of the country for the past two months. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have sought refuge here or have passed through on the way to Poland and other countries.At Lviv’s central train station, volunteers handed out Easter chocolates to displaced children arriving from other cities. One family who received the treats had walked for five days with their four children from the devastated southern port of Mariupol on their way to the relative safety of western Ukraine.Many Ukrainians said they were sticking to their traditions in the face of a pervasive sadness and fear the war had brought.“This year there’s not so much happiness in people’s faces and eyes,” said Myroslava Zakharkiv, a college English instructor. “Many people are grieving, many men are gone to the front.”Ms. Zakharkiv, 48, said that she had done a traditional Easter cleaning of her home in a village near Lviv. She also had baked Easter bread and prepared foods to put in a basket to be blessed at the church.“We hope there will be no bombs and no alarms but no one knows what will happen so we are a bit afraid,” she said.For many of the displaced, the war has also meant separation from their families.Anna Mukoida, 22, said this was the first Easter she would spend away from her family, who stayed in Bila Tserkva, a town 50 miles south of the capital, Kyiv, while she fled to the southwestern city of Chernivtsi.Despite the danger and uncertainty, many Ukrainians were determined to hold on to tradition.“Easter in the time of the war is like the sun on a rainy day,” said Ms. Mukoida. “It is very important now to have such days just to feel alive and remember that there was life before the war.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Neonila Vodolska, 22, was also displaced. She was staying in the western city of Kalush, far from her family in Kyiv. To ease the pain of separation from her family, she said she bought a white shirt with traditional dark red embroidery to wear on Easter Day.“Now I fully understand the importance of saving such traditions,” Ms. Vodolska said. “Doing something normal, celebrating something that reminds me of the good times, of my childhood, brings me hope.”ImageA priest, Fotiy, blessing Easter sweet bread on Saturday before they were to be distributed by volunteers from a humanitarian aid center in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesIn most parts of the country, curfews remained in place over Saturday night, when many Christians traditionally hold vigils and celebrate a midnight Mass in memory of those who waited on Holy Saturday by Christ’s tomb. Instead many people planned to watch the Mass on television.“We must understand that the gathering of civilians at a predetermined time of all-night service can be a target for missiles, aircraft and artillery,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Saturday morning.In Lviv, the authorities initially announced the curfew would be lifted but then reimposed it after receiving intelligence that pro-Russia saboteurs could be planning attacks in the city.Earlier in the week, the head of Orthodox Church in Ukraine, the Metropolitan Epifaniy, asked clergy to forgo nighttime Easter services in areas of the country affected by fighting, fearing Russian bombardments.“It is not hard to believe this will really happen, because the enemy is trying to completely destroy us,” he said in a televised speech.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/ukrainian-easter-traditions.html
153,"Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, thousands of buildings across the country have been destroyed by cruise missiles, aerial bombs and shells. Entire cities — Mariupol, Izium and Volnovakha — are almost demolished. In Kharkiv, some of the most important architectural monuments of the Soviet era and the prerevolutionary period have suffered extensive damage. A number of UNESCO World Heritage sites and architectural treasures are under threat.If, in the first days of the invasion, the Russians declared that they were targeting only military infrastructure, it quickly became clear that they were hitting buildings suffused with the memory and history of the people who lived in them: residential buildings, kindergartens, office centers, theaters. There are thousands of open wounds across the country. The worst thing is that you never know where the next Russian bomb will land.After Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, many Ukrainians I know who were involved in protecting cultural heritage stepped up to defend the country as soldiers and volunteers because they had learned in peacetime how to protect what belonged to them — not just territory but also millions of small memories of walks home under a peaceful sky, good neighborliness and mutual support.Before 2014, we rarely saw public displays of interest in cultural heritage in Ukraine. The Maidan revolution that year, in which mass protests led to the ouster of a pro-Russian president, kick-started the development of civil society based on Western values, like freedom of expression and self-determination. In defending these values, Ukrainians learned to be responsible for public spaces.Young Ukrainian intellectuals — artists, researchers, filmmakers, cultural managers — became involved in documenting art and culture throughout the country. After Russia annexed Crimea and helped occupy part of the Donbas after the Maidan revolution, citing fictitious “fascism” and the need to protect the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine, the processes of decolonization of the country’s culture intensified.Preservation activists felt that this was their new purpose: to reclaim the history of Ukraine and its legacy, to destroy the colonial patterns of the Soviet Union.One striking example of this newfound mission sits on a busy street in one of Kyiv’s most popular neighborhoods: a beautiful building covered with dead vines. Pieces of the facade are lying around it, and parts of iron ceilings are sticking out of the columns. This building was damaged not by a Russian bomb but by real estate developers months before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The modernist building, with the bright name Flowers of Ukraine, was built in Kyiv in the 1980s for an institution studying flowers. Grapevines were planted on its facade and grew across the building over three decades. In the summer of 2021, a Kyiv construction company received permission to remodel much of the building and replace it with a shopping center and offices; the company started by cutting off the grapevines and destroying the facade with excavator buckets. This came as a shock to the citizens of Kyiv.Dozens of Kyivans took to the streets to protect the building, and in a short time, the protesters managed to halt its complete destruction. But the broken facade of the building, which sits in the middle of the city center, continued to grimly remind us that Ukrainian cultural heritage is fragile.The Flowers of Ukraine episode left a depressing impression. Passing by, I often thought that it reminded me of a house destroyed by war, which I saw more than once in the Donbas and Iraq.ImageA nurse outside her destroyed apartment building in Mariupol, Ukraine.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersEvery piece of Kyiv’s space is filled with memories that form a living history, passed from hand to hand through generations, that is important to preserve and protect. Before the war, as soon as it became known that a Ukrainian building of historical significance was threatened with destruction, citizens immediately ran to it and stood up for its defense. And the fight for every single building taught us to fight for our homes, cities and country.Looking at the news about the destruction of Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv, we hear many voices and the same mantra: After the war, we will rebuild it all; we will take back our cities and restore what cannot be destroyed — our culture.Katerina Sergatskova is the editor in chief of Zaborona Media and a co-founder of the 2402 Foundation, which helps journalists in Ukraine.

154,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in his latest address seized on an apparent Russian threat to use chemical weapons against the remaining defenders of Mariupol, as they prepare for what he called a “new stage of terror against Ukraine.”Mr. Zelensky’s comments came after Eduard Basurin, a spokesman for the Kremlin-backed, separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, said on Russian television that Russia should bring in “chemical forces” to use in Mariupol, the besieged southern city. He said the remaining Ukrainian forces in Mariupol were dug in at a steel plant and that Russia should encircle it and “smoke out the moles.”Referring to those remarks, Mr. Zelensky said in his latest video address, “We take this as seriously as possible.” The video was posted online Monday in the United States, and shortly after midnight on Tuesday in Ukraine.Earlier in the day, a Ukrainian unit in Mariupol claimed on social media that Russian invaders had used chemical weapons there. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament, made a similar charge. But those reports could not be independently confirmed.“We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine,” John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. “We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.”The British Defense Ministry said on Monday that prior use of phosphorous munitions by Russian forces in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine “raises in the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies.”The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday night.The Ukrainian Parliament said on Monday that it had learned of local reports from the police that Russian forces had fired on nitric acid tanks in the Donetsk region.In his address, Mr. Zelensky called on Ukrainian allies to help supply “necessary weapons.”“Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner,” Mr. Zelensky said in a translation of his address shared by his office. “I am sure that we will get almost everything we need, but not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost — lives that can no longer be returned.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/world/chemical-weapons-mariupol.html
155,"PARIS — Emmanuel Macron won a second term as president of France, triumphing on Sunday over Marine Le Pen, his far-right challenger, after a campaign where his promise of stability prevailed over the temptation of an extremist lurch.Projections at the close of voting, which are generally reliable, showed Mr. Macron, a centrist, gaining 58.5 percent of the vote to Ms. Le Pen’s 41.5 percent. His victory was much narrower than in 2017, when the margin was 66.1 percent to 33.9 percent for Ms. Le Pen, but wider than appeared likely two weeks ago.Speaking to a crowd massed on the Champ de Mars in front of a twinkling Eiffel Tower, a solemn Mr. Macron said his was a victory for “a more independent France and a stronger Europe.” He added: “Our country is riddled with so many doubts, so many divisions. We will have to be strong, but nobody will be left by the side of the road.”Ms. Le Pen conceded defeat in her third attempt to become president, but bitterly criticized the “brutal and violent methods” of Mr. Macron, without explaining what she meant. She vowed to fight on to secure a large number of representatives in legislative elections in June, declaring that “French people have this evening shown their desire for a strong counter power to Emmanuel Macron.”ImageMr. Macron addressed supporters in front of the Eiffel Tower after his victory.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesAt a critical moment in Europe, with fighting raging in Ukraine after the Russian invasion, France rejected a candidate hostile to NATO, to the European Union, to the United States, and to its fundamental values that hold that no French citizens should be discriminated against because they are Muslim.Jean-Yves Le Drian, the foreign minister, said the result reflected “the mobilization of French people for the maintenance of their values and against a narrow vision of France.”The French do not generally love their presidents, and none had succeeded in being re-elected since 2002, let alone by a 17-point margin. Mr. Macron’s unusual achievement in securing five more years in power reflects his effective stewardship over the Covid-19 crisis, his rekindling of the economy, and his political agility in occupying the entire center of the political spectrum.Ms. Le Pen, softening her image if not her anti-immigrant nationalist program, rode a wave of alienation and disenchantment to bring the extreme right closer to power than at any time since 1944. Her National Rally party has joined the mainstream, even if at the last minute many French people clearly voted for Mr. Macron to ensure that France not succumb to the xenophobic vitriol of the darker passages of its history.Ms. Le Pen is a longtime sympathizer with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she visited at the Kremlin during her last campaign in 2017. She would almost certainly have pursued policies that weakened the united allied front to save Ukraine from Russia’s assault; offered Mr. Putin a breach to exploit in Europe; and undermined the European Union, whose engine has always been a joint Franco-German commitment to it.ImageMarine Le Pen conceded to Mr. Macron on Sunday.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesIf Brexit was a blow to unity, a French nationalist quasi-exit, as set out in Ms. Le Pen’s proposals, would have left the European Union on life support. That, in turn, would have crippled an essential guarantor of peace on the continent in a volatile moment.Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, declared that Mr. Macron’s win was “a vote of confidence in Europe.” Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, congratulated the French leader and called France “one of our closest and most important allies.”Mr. Scholz and two other European leaders had taken the unusual step last week of making clear the importance of a vote against Ms. Le Pen in an opinion article in the daily newspaper Le Monde. The letter was a reflection of the anxiety in European capitals and Washington that preceded the vote.“It is the choice between a democratic candidate, who believes that France is stronger in a powerful and autonomous European Union, and a far-right candidate, who openly sides with those who attack our freedom and our democracy,” they wrote.Mr. Macron’s second victory felt different from his first. Five years ago, he was a 39-year-old wunderkind bursting on the French political scene with a promise to bury sterile left-right divisions and build a more just, equal, open and dynamic society. He organized a massive celebration in the main courtyard of the Louvre to mark the dawn of a new political era in France.Sunday night, given the war in Europe, he asked for sobriety from his supporters. As Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” the European hymn, played (but much more softly than in 2017), he walked onto the Champ de Mars holding the hand of his wife, Brigitte. Children surrounded the couple; the choreography conveyed simplicity and humility.ImageSupporters of Mr. Macron celebrated on the Champ de Mars.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesMr. Macron has often been criticized for an aloofness bordering on arrogance during his first term.“We avoided a certain form of violence. I am relieved,” said Eric Maus, 64, a Macron supporter. “But I feel like I am handing my daughter an uncertain world where the extreme right scores so high.”Mr. Macron succeeded in spurring growth, slashing unemployment and instilling a start-up tech culture, but was unable to address growing inequality or simmering anger among the alienated and the struggling in areas of urban blight and rural remoteness. Societal divisions sharpened as incomes stagnated, prices rose and factories moved abroad.As a result, Mr. Macron’s political capital is more limited, even if his clear victory has saved France from a dangerous tilt toward xenophobic nationalism and given him momentum ahead of the June legislative elections.Still, many of the 7.7 million voters who had supported the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round of the presidential election on April 10 voted only reluctantly for Mr. Macron to keep Ms. Le Pen from power. Assina Channa, a Muslim of Algerian descent voting in the suburb of Saint-Denis north of Paris, said, “Nothing is going to change but I had no choice.”Ms. Le Pen had proposed a ban on the Muslim head scarf and has regularly equated Islam with violence in the country with the largest Muslim community in western Europe. “At least he doesn’t threaten us like she does,” Ms. Channa said.ImageA polling station in Saint-Denis.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesMr. Macron acknowledged that “many of our compatriots voted for me today not to support my ideas but to form a dam against the extreme right.” He thanked them and said “I am now entrusted with their sense of duty, their attachment to the Republic and their respect for the differences expressed these past weeks.”Some 28 percent of the electorate abstained, three percentage points higher than in 2017, and it appeared that more than 13 million people had voted for Ms. Le Pen and the extreme right. “The anger and the disagreements that led my compatriots to vote for this project must also find an answer,” Mr. Macron said.It was a speech not of soaring rhetoric but of sober realism, almost at times contrition, reflecting his recognition of a starkly divided France and perhaps also his inattention to those for whom life has been hardest.The dreams of radical change of 2017 have been supplanted by fears of political confrontation over the summer, in part because the dislike of Mr. Macron among his opponents is strong, and in part because the legislative elections in June could result in a National Assembly less pliant to his will.Constantly adjusting his positions, extending the circle of his allies and refining his ideas, Mr. Macron has proved himself a consummate politician, suffocating any would-be moderate challengers. He engineered the near total demise of the center-left Socialist Party and the center-right Republicans, the two political forces at the heart of postwar French politics. It was a remarkable feat.ImageSupporters of Mr. Macron celebrating in Paris on Sunday.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesBut there was a price to pay for all this. The old structure of French politics has collapsed, and it is less clear how the violent conflicts of society can be mediated.Those conflicts have become more acute as anger has grown in the parts of France that have felt neglected, even forgotten, by the elites in major cities. By addressing these concerns, and promising a series of tax cuts to help people cope with rising prices for gas and electricity, Ms. Le Pen built an effective campaign.Her message, for some voters, was that she would care for and protect them while their president seemed to have other concerns. But her nationalist message also resonated among people angered by undocumented immigrants entering the country and seeking scapegoats for the country’s problems.The president’s problems have reflected both his personality and political choices. His highly personalized top-down style of government owed more to Bonaparte than to the democratic opening he had said he would bring to the French presidential system. His attempts to force march Europe toward a vision of “strategic autonomy” backed by its own integrated military has met resistance in the countries like Poland that are most attached to America as a European power.Emerging from the moderate left of the political system, and supported by many Socialists five years ago, Mr. Macron veered to the right both in his initial economic policy and in a much-criticized decision to confront what he called “Islamist separatism” by shutting down several mosques and Islamic associations — often on flimsy legal grounds.He judged that he had more to gain on the right than to fear on the fragmented left of the political spectrum in a country whose psyche has been deeply marked by several Islamist terrorist attacks since 2015. In a sense, his victory proved him correct, the master of a broad web of adjustable allegiances that left his opponents floundering.Aida Alami, Daphné Anglès, Aurelien Breeden, Adèle Cordonnier and Constant Méheut contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/french-election-results-macron-le-pen.html

Do we have the attention span to stay focused on the Russian descent into pure evil?With brutal methods perfected in other conflicts, the Russians are committing ever more brazen atrocities; they are raping and killing civilians. On Friday, they struck fleeing civilians in a train station in eastern Ukraine, where a missile psychopathically labeled “For our children” killed at least 50 people and wounded nearly 100.“Why do they need to hit civilians with missiles? Why this cruelty?” Volodymyr Zelensky asked the Finnish Parliament on Friday, adding, “Sometimes, you think whether they are human at all.”He pleaded, “Hatred has to lose.”But are we moving on?

Now, there are trends. “You’re trending” is the highest compliment you can pay someone — or the biggest alarm you can sound. If something is trending, no matter what, it commands the highest commercial respect.But trends are transient, by definition. American attention goes from transient to transient to transient. A lifetime of ephemera. We used to have thought leaders; now we have influencers.It’s a cognitive challenge, but can we find ways to keep our attention on things that require our attention? Do we have any mental discipline at all?Consider climate change. We can stick with our concern when California and Colorado are burning to a crisp. But then the fires burn out and we move on to the next thing, the next trend. Crises are not trends.Look at energy independence.

Then, basically what happened is, Stalin came in and said, ‘No, it’s really just about violence and domination, and screw all that.’“I think the current wave of populism has that character,” Lanier added. “The ever finer gradations of thought on all kinds of issues, like gender and intersectionality and this theory and that theory, it’s so sophisticated that it requires a lot of patience. It’s too inbred to be robust. So this very crude thing comes in.“There’s more and more sophisticated talk about how we’re going to do blockchain, nonfungible tokens and cryptocurrencies, with contracts built in in its algorithms. I’m personally of the belief that this very fancy approach to technology is headed in the same direction as cultures or politics that get too fancy and too full of themselves.“Basically, the Russians came in and said, ‘Screw all of your ideas. We’re just going to brutally take this stuff over and use it for power.’ Putin’s psychological operatives looked at all the stuff we do on social media and said, ‘We’ll just step in and use that to weaken you. We don’t care about these ideas.’“I think ideals are great, but idealists who get too involved with their own sense of getting more sophisticated to perfect their schemes? I think then it reverts to brutality.”As he got off the phone, Lanier offered one note of optimism about Trump, Putin and their ilk: “One of the great truths of history is that the great deceivers also deceive themselves.”We live in a world of easy deceit and endless distractions.

157,"LVIV, Ukraine — The explosion — deafening, blinding — collapsed the walls around them, and “the moments afterwards felt like an eternity, waiting to hear my child’s scream so I would know she was alive,” Viktoria Dubovitskaya said. “Maybe she will be without legs or arms, but just let her be alive.”Ms. Dubovitskaya, interviewed last month at a shelter in Lviv, in western Ukraine, said she and her two young children were among the many civilians sheltering in Mariupol’s Drama Theater on March 16 when it was devastated by a Russian airstrike. A wall fell onto her 2-year-old daughter, Nastya, and in those horrific first moments, Ms. Dubovitskaya recalled, she did not know if the girl had survived.Finally, she heard it: “Mama!” Nastya screamed. A mattress that had been propped up against the wall fell against her daughter, cushioning the blows. Under the shattered masonry, Nastya was alive, but the place where they had taken refuge for 11 days, along with hundreds of others, was destroyed.The theater bombing in Mariupol, a port city in southern Ukraine, may have killed hundreds of people in a single strike and is one of the most prominent examples of the atrocities that Russia has inflicted in its invasion of Ukraine. Soon after that attack, President Biden labeled President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a war criminal.Like so much of what has happened in besieged and bombarded Mariupol, information about the attack on the theater has emerged in an unsteady trickle. It is not clear how many civilians were there or how many died, and communication with the city has been all but eliminated. Mariupol’s administration says it believes about 300 people died in the theater strike. Officials said they knew of 130 survivors.ImageMariupol’s Drama Theater was devastated by a Russian airstrike last month. Hundreds of people were thought to have been sheltering there.Credit...Alexei Alexandrov/Associated PressMultiple attempts to open safe corridors and evacuate Mariupol residents have been stymied, and several aid convoys have been forced to turn back. The mayor said on Thursday that he believed at least 5,000 people had been killed in attacks on the city.Ms. Dubovitskaya, 24, said she lost her phone, with photographs from the theater, in the chaos of the bombing, and her story could not be independently verified. But the Instagram account of her husband, Dmitri Dubovitsky, features photographs of the family with geolocation tags showing they were from Mariupol. A friend of Mr. Dubovitsky’s, Maksim Glusets, said his wife had also been inside the theater and saw Ms. Dubovitskaya and her children, whom they also knew socially from Mariupol.The New York Times interviewed Ms. Dubovitskaya after being contacted by a volunteer helping to coordinate outreach to Ukrainian and international media so that evacuees could tell their stories. The volunteer was made aware by a doctor who helps displaced people that Ms. Dubovitskaya had arrived in Lviv. Ms. Dubovitskaya said she wanted to share her account of being in the theater in Mariupol, which has also been cut off from water and electricity during the fighting, with the West and to ask nations to send more weapons to Ukraine.As the Russian military has flattened Mariupol and tightened its cordon around the remaining Ukrainian defenders, people have fled in fits and starts, in cars and buses weaving through rubble, craters, burned-out vehicles and Russian military checkpoints.ImageA Mariupol resident cooking food last week outside a damaged children’s home where she had taken refuge.

(Her husband was in Poland, where he had been working since before the war began on Feb. 24.) The bomb hit near the stage, she said, and people who had been sheltering there, or in the basement under it, had little chance of surviving. With combat raging nearby, and follow-up strikes feared, emergency services could not immediately reach the scene.“When we walked downstairs, we just saw dead bodies,” Ms. Dubovitskaya said. “So many bodies. The whole place was covered in blood. We knew that another strike could happen, or that Russian soldiers might come for a zachistka,” or “cleansing,” of the city.“We just ran,” she said.

He knows everything.”But he has been traumatized by what has happened around him — suffering that became evident days before the theater bombing.“He fell asleep at lunch, and when he woke up, he did not know where he was, who I was or who my friend was,” she said. “I immediately took him to the doctor in my arms. This child does not sit in arms — he never sits at all — and then he allowed me to take him and carry him. And I try to talk to him, and he doesn’t recognize me. He calls out for his mother, and he doesn’t understand that I am his mother.”Once he returned to himself 20 minutes later, she said, he told her, “I just want to live.”Ms. Dubovitskaya said the episode brought home how much of his childhood had been taken from him. “He is not asking for toys or even for food,” she said. “He just wants to live.”It was another visit to a doctor that may have saved the family’s lives.Staying in the crowded, freezing theater, her daughter developed pneumonia, Ms. Dubovitskaya said. So she took her children to a makeshift clinic on the second floor, where they were allotted a place to stay. That took them away from the bomb’s point of impact.When her daughter screamed, “Mama!” after the wall fell on her, Ms. Dubovitskaya said, happiness and relief rushed through her. “I began to grope around in the rubble,” she said. “I felt some kind of fabric, and just pulled and pulled. She was all white, except for her face, because she covered her face with a blanket and fell into it.”“It probably saved her,” Ms. Dubovitskaya said, “because if a stone had hit her head, it would be almost impossible for a 2-year-old child to survive.”ImageMs. Dubovitskaya playing with her daughter last month in Lviv.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/mariupol-theater-ukraine.html
158,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Thursday that global supply chains had proved to be unstable amid the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine and called for a reshaping of trade relationships oriented around “trusted partners,” even if it meant higher costs for businesses and consumers.Ms. Yellen spoke at a news conference during the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, where policymakers around the world have been discussing how to revive economic growth and combat inflation while keeping pressure on Russia. The Treasury secretary said that protectionism, or taxing imports more, was not the answer, but that the economic benefits of the world’s network of supply chains were not worth the risk of a reliance on adversaries.“Our supply chains are not secure, and they’re not resilient,” Ms. Yellen said at the Treasury Department. “And I think that’s something, in terms of long-term risk to the U.S. and to other countries, that’s a threat that needs to be addressed.”Ms. Yellen added that trusted trading blocs would need to be big enough to avoid amplifying inflation while ensuring that supply chains were secure.“I don’t think it would mean permanently higher inflation, but just a somewhat higher level of cost, a somewhat less efficient system but one that is more resilient,” she said.Global policymakers at the meetings this week have been grappling with how to address supply chain disruptions that have led food prices to surge around the world. Officials will release in the coming weeks proposals to bolster food supplies, ensure that small farmers can afford fertilizer and improve social safety nets in places with food insecurity.“There’s a very real risk soaring global market prices for food and fertilizer will result in more people going hungry, further exacerbate inflation and harmful fiscal and external positions,” Ms. Yellen said.Economic forecasts this week underscored the significant headwinds that the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia were inflicting on the global economy. The Biden administration made clear this week that it intended to ramp up pressure on Russia, rolling out new sanctions and announcing on Thursday $1.3 billion in military and economic aid to Ukraine.At the news conference, Ms. Yellen said rebuilding Ukraine would be costly and suggested that Russia should have to bear some of that expense.“It’s clear that the rebuilding costs, ultimately, in Ukraine are going be enormous,” Ms. Yellen said. “And certainly looking to Russia one way or another to help provide some of what’s necessary for Ukraine to build is something I think we ought to be pursuing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/business/janet-yellen-supply-chains.html
159,"WASHINGTON — As Western leaders have raced to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with steps to reduce imports of Russian fossil fuels, U.S. lawmakers and officials are confronting a thorny dilemma over another source of energy: the Russian uranium that powers many American nuclear plants.While President Biden banned imports of Russian oil, gas and coal last month, his administration did not immediately move to halt uranium imports from Russia. The United States relied on Russia for about 16 percent of its uranium in 2020, with another 30 percent from two of the country’s close partners, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Russia’s exports of oil and gas have received outsize attention as Western nations have sought to impose economic penalties on the country. But the invasion of Ukraine has also put a spotlight on Russia’s sale of uranium to the United States, the world’s largest consumer of the metal, where nuclear power accounts for about 20 percent of electricity generation.Dismay over the war has given common purpose to energy officials who view nuclear power as key to Mr. Biden’s long-term vision for reducing carbon emissions and to members of Congress who have argued for years to scale up domestic uranium production and enrichment. To both camps, Russia’s aggression adds urgency for the United States to reduce its dependency on imported uranium and invest in domestic suppliers that could help power the next generation of nuclear plants.Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, introduced a bill in March to ban imports of Russian uranium, and a matching, bipartisan bill was introduced in the House last week.“While banning imports of Russian oil, gas and coal is an important step, it cannot be the last,” Mr. Barrasso said in a statement. “Banning Russian uranium imports will further defund Russia’s war machine, help revive American uranium production and increase our national security.”At her confirmation hearing last month, Kathryn Huff, Mr. Biden’s pick to lead the Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy, said the invasion of Ukraine demonstrated the nuclear industry’s vulnerabilities and highlighted the need to increase domestic production.“It is critically important that we wean ourselves off unstable, untrustworthy sources of our critical fuels, including uranium,” she said.The United States has sought to manage its reliance on Russian uranium since the end of the Cold War. Under an agreement reached with Russia’s Ministry for Atomic Energy in 1992, the United States sought to limit purchases of Russian uranium to about 20 percent of its total need. An amendment to that agreement, signed in 2020, aimed to further reduce imports to 15 percent by 2028.But as of 2020, close to half the uranium used for fuel in the United States was imported from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The amended agreement authorized the United States to purchase as much as 24 percent of its nuclear fuel from Russia next year.Further complicating matters, the Energy Department announced plans in 2020 to invest up to $3.2 billion in the development of a new generation of advanced reactors — including one devised by TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates — that rely on a more enriched variety of uranium that is only produced at commercial scale by Russia.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Domestic suppliers have been hesitant to invest in producing that fuel — high-assay, low-enriched uranium, or HALEU — as the advanced reactors that could use it are still years from completion.“It’s not that anyone thinks we can’t make it,” said Matt Bowen, a research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. “But it would involve costs, and none of them have been willing, I think for very understandable reasons, to make that investment because they aren’t sure if these reactor projects are really going to happen.”The new reactors have been designed to be cheaper, safer and more efficient than older ones. They have been proposed in the hope of replacing some of the 93 reactors that are currently in operation across the United States, many of which are more than 40 years old and nearing the end of their intended life spans.But in light of Russia’s actions, TerraPower and other companies developing new reactors have said they will not use the more enriched fuel from Russia, even though no commercial alternative exists.As aging nuclear plants are gradually retired, renewable sources such as wind and solar power would have to be drastically increased to fill the gap in carbon-free power production if new nuclear plants are not built.In recent hearings on Capitol Hill, some senators have discussed asking the Energy Department to help create fuel that is needed for advanced reactor projects in the short term. The department maintains limited inventories of enriched uranium that can be “down-blended,” or mixed with unenriched material to produce fuel that is usable in advanced reactors.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.But to create a steady stream of uranium for existing nuclear plants and future models, lawmakers have also called for renewed funding for mines and enrichment facilities that have long sat idle or reduced production.The United States has significant uranium deposits in states such as Wyoming, Texas and New Mexico. But the troubled environmental history of some sites and the impact they have had on tribal lands have also revived longstanding concerns about resuming large-scale uranium production domestically.At a hearing on critical mineral supply chains on Thursday, Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, cited the continued environmental challenges caused by a mine in the Pueblo of Laguna, a Superfund site in his state that has defied cleanup efforts for decades.“Uranium mining and milling sites still leach radioactive waste into our groundwater,” Mr. Heinrich said. “It is still barely reclaimed.”The question of how to support the nuclear industry while moving away from Russian suppliers will most likely be an urgent priority for Dr. Huff, who could be confirmed by the Senate this month.Last year, the Energy Department moved ahead with plans to establish a national reserve that would stockpile uranium purchased from domestic producers in part to help jump-start the industry. Congress allocated $75 million in 2020 to help fund the reserve, but no purchases have been made.But the effort to begin buying uranium for the reserve has been met by resistance from Democrats, including Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. In a letter last year, Mr. Markey and five House members argued that the creation of the reserve posed “a serious threat to the health of tribal and environmental justice communities, as well as to the overall environment.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/russia-uranium-nuclear-power.html
160,"Ukraine has defeated Russia in the first phase of their war, and a second phase has begun.Having failed to topple Ukraine’s government, Russia has narrowed its ambitions and is concentrating on the eastern part of Ukraine known as the Donbas region. Vladimir Putin’s new goal appears to be severing Donbas from the rest of Ukraine and creating puppet republics there.ImageCredit...The New York TimesThis new phase brings some big advantages that Russia did not have when it was attempting to conquer all of Ukraine. But Putin and his military also face some of the same challenges — including low morale — as before. The outcome remains highly uncertain.(Here’s a Times overview of the coming battle.)Today’s newsletter explains the battle for Donbas, with help from Times reporters around the world. We will start by looking at Russia’s new advantages and then consider Ukraine’s continuing advantages.Russia’s edge …When I was talking with Eric Schmitt — a Times senior writer who has been covering military issues for most of the past three decades — he offered a useful analogy for thinking about the war’s new phase.Until now, much of the fighting has occurred in parts of Ukraine that roughly resemble an American suburb, Eric explained. There are houses, office buildings and side streets where Ukrainian forces can hide and then attack Russian soldiers. This physical geography leaves civilians vulnerable — but benefits troops that are using guerrilla warfare to defend territory against an advancing army.ImageA ravaged suburb of Kyiv.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesMuch of the Donbas region is different. Its geography more closely resembles the plains of Kansas than a New York City suburb. “It’s much more wide open,” Eric said. “There are fewer places for Ukrainians to pop out from.”Today, there are actual trench lines in Donbas, stretching over hundreds of miles and sometimes separating areas controlled by Ukraine from those controlled by Russia. This terrain will allow Russia to use its many tanks, large missile systems and other heavy weapons systems; Ukraine’s military has far fewer of these. The shoulder-fired missiles that Ukraine has been receiving from the West, and using to great effect over the past two months, will probably be less helpful in Donbas.The newly focused battlefield has other tactical advantages for Russia, too:It can concentrate its troops in Donbas, and a direct conflict between the countries’ armies seems to favor Russia. When the war began, it had more than twice as many troops as Ukraine, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.The Donbas region borders Russia, allowing Putin’s generals to build shorter and less exposed supply lines than they needed elsewhere in Ukraine.Russia is familiar with the territory. It began fighting sporadic battles in Donbas in 2014 and has since been supporting separatist rebels there. The new head of the war effort, General Aleksandr Dvornikov, has overseen Russian operations in Donbas since 2016, after commanding Russian troops in Syria.In addition to military tactics, public opinion in Donbas also appears to be more favorable to Russia than it is elsewhere in Ukraine. Shortly before the war, about 30 percent of the region’s residents wanted it to become part of Russia, while about another 10 percent favored independence, according to a poll by academic researchers.In areas currently controlled by Russian-backed separatists — which make up more than one-third of Donbas — a slight majority favored leaving Ukraine. That’s very different from the situation in the rest of the country, where Ukrainian patriotism is widely shared.… and Ukraine’s edgeTogether, Russia’s advantages offer reason to believe that it may fare better in the next phase of the war than during its humiliating defeat and withdrawal in the initial phase.But before you assume that’s inevitable, it is worth remembering something: On paper, Russia also seemed likely to win the first phase of the war. Military planners in Moscow expected that they would be able to topple Ukraine’s government within days or weeks. Many experts in the U.S. and Western Europe — and many westerners in Ukraine when the war began — assumed the same.It didn’t happen. Russia’s military proved far less effective than most observers expected.Its air force was not able to dominate the skies over Ukraine. Its military units rarely communicated over encrypted lines, allowing Ukraine to intercept its messages. Many Russian troops did not expect to invade Ukraine and were not happy their superiors ordered them to do so.“The vehicles are still poorly maintained, troop morale will remain low,” Michael Repass, an American major general who has worked with Ukraine for years, told The Times.Even if winning control of Donbas is an easier task than overwhelming all of Ukraine, it is not easy. Ukraine has highly motivated troops, more of whom can now shift to Donbas. And the West is racing to supply Ukraine with tanks and heavy, longer-range artillery, as well as the shoulder-fired missiles that proved so effective around Kyiv. “How this logistical race goes could well shape the outcome of the war,” this Times story explains.ImageA body in the street in Kharkiv after a Russian artillery strike.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesPublic opinion in Donbas may also be shifting away from Russia, because of the invasion. “If a bomb falls on your house, latent sympathies change into hard antipathies,” Michael Schwirtz, a Times reporter in Ukraine, said. At the start of the war, he was reporting from Kharkiv, an eastern Ukrainian city where — as in parts of Donbas — the primary language is Russian. Yet the invasion nonetheless made many Kharkiv residents “viciously, viciously angry,” Michael said.The Institute for the Study of War, a military research group in Washington, offered this summary:Russian forces may be able to gain ground through the heavy concentration of artillery and numbers. However, Russian operations are unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv. The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes — poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale — that impeded prior offensives.The bottom line: A quick victory — by either side — seems unlikely. Then again, war is often very difficult to predict.More on UkraineThe last Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol is a steel plant with underground tunnels. “They’re bombing us with everything they can,” one soldier said.Wimbledon is planning to bar tennis players from Russia and Belarus from this year’s tournament.From Times Opinion: Volodymyr Zelensky’s traits — courage, truth-telling and a fighting spirit — are rare among today’s politicians, Bret Stephens writes.THE LATEST NEWSThe VirusImageAn Amtrak train to New York yesterday.Credit...Hilary Swift for The New York TimesPresident Biden said Americans should decide for themselves whether to wear masks on public transportation.Airline workers expressed relief: “They don’t like being policemen,” one executive said.Travelers’ reactions were mixed: Some were ready to shed masks, and others planned to keep theirs on.BusinessImageDean Baquet and Joe Kahn.Credit...Celeste Sloman for The New York TimesJoe Kahn will be the next executive editor of The Times, succeeding Dean Baquet.

161,"Hackers affiliated with the governments of Russia and Belarus have turned their attention to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February, attempting to use Facebook for cyberespionage and disinformation campaigns, the social network’s parent company, Meta, said on Thursday.Some of the hackers, who had been focused on disinformation campaigns in Poland and the West, suddenly pivoted their attention to Ukraine, where they began trying to spread false messages about a Ukrainian military surrender, Meta executives said. Others blamed Russia’s invasion on NATO and accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilians, while amateur hackers and social media users tried to spread disinformation, remove Facebook accounts that criticized the invasion and profit off the crisis through scams.“Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we’ve seen attacks on internet freedom and access to information intensifying sharply,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs. The company has scrambled in recent weeks to moderate conversations about the conflict on its platform, while also fending off hackers. Some of the disinformation campaigns also used Twitter, YouTube and Russian social media sites to spread their messages, Meta said.Ghostwriter, a hacking group affiliated with Belarus, has continued its efforts to break into dozens of Ukrainian military officials’ Facebook accounts and post false messages about a surrender, Meta said in a broader quarterly report about cyberattacks and disinformation on its platform. The company, which disclosed similar efforts by Ghostwriter last month, blocked the group from posting videos purporting to show surrendering soldiers, said Ben Nimmo, Meta’s global threat intelligence lead for influence operations.Another group linked to the Belarusian K.G.B., which had focused on spreading disinformation in Poland, switched its focus to Ukraine as the conflict began and also tried to spread false surrender messages, Meta said in its report.Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which has been known for creating misleading social media profiles and using them to spread disinformation, set up a website last year to spread messages about police violence in the West and tried to set up Facebook accounts in January and February to boost content from the website, Meta executives said. Meta blocked the profiles but noticed that, upon the invasion, the group suddenly began creating articles blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine and accusing the Ukrainian military of targeting civilians.Civilians also jumped into the online conflict, Meta said. In the Luhansk region of Ukraine, websites and social media accounts that had promoted pro-Russian commentary were taken over by hackers, who directed their audiences to Telegram channels that showed images of Russian casualties. And in Russia, users established a Facebook group that purported to be for sharing cooking tips but was then used to mass-report profiles that criticized the invasion in an effort to get Facebook to remove them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/europe/russia-hackers-facebook-disinformation.html
162,"The brutalities of Russia’s war in Ukraine have stoked enormous demand among Ukrainians and much of the Western world for investigations, indictments, arrests and trials for the invaders and their commanders, notably President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Some leaders, including President Biden, have even accused them of genocide.The calls for accountability have pressed for prosecutions not only at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which was established precisely for such a purpose, but in other courts and even special war crimes tribunals that could be created specifically to put suspects on trial, like the proceedings against the Nazis who were judged at Nuremberg.And yet, despite the speedy collection of evidence in Ukraine and an outpouring of international cooperation to build criminal case files, the likelihood of any significant war crimes trials, much less convictions, could be years away — if they ever occur — especially for Mr. Putin.The Russian authorities have denied all responsibility for civilian killings and abuse, and Mr. Putin has falsely depicted the troves of evidence as fabricated smears.“Everybody wants the war to stop, and save Ukraine immediate pain, and see the chief perpetrators in the dock,” said Leila Sadat, an international law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an adviser to the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor. “Unfortunately, that is not going to be quick.”What, exactly, are war crimes?They are actions by antagonists in armed conflicts that violate international agreements and treaties like the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which were designed to limit the barbarities of war and protect the lives and safety of noncombatants — civilians, medics, aid workers — as well as soldiers who can no longer fight, like prisoners, the wounded and the sick. It is a war crime, for example, to knowingly bomb a hospital, a school or a place where civilians are sheltering, or to kill enemy soldiers who have disarmed and surrendered.What does the International Criminal Court do?The court, established in 2002 under an international treaty known as the Rome Statute, was empowered by the countries that ratified the agreement to investigate and prosecute not only war crimes but two arguably more sinister types of crimes: genocide — acts aimed at destroying a racial, religious, ethnic or national group — and crimes against humanity — acts including murder, enslavement, rape and other sexual abuse, torture, starvation, abduction and forcible displacement as part of a widespread, systematic attack.ImageKarim Khan, right, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, at a mass grave this week in Bucha, Ukraine, with the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova.Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn 2018, the court was empowered to investigate and prosecute a fourth type of crime: the crime of aggression, which prohibits the leaders of any country from “the planning, preparation, initiation or execution” of an attack on another country in violation of the United Nations Charter — in other words, making it illegal to invade another country. Although major restrictions were placed on the court that narrowed its jurisdiction in crime-of-aggression cases, legal scholars said it was the first time since the Nuremberg Trials that an international tribunal had been empowered to try suspects for crimes against peace.Why are many of these crimes difficult to prosecute and prove?The circumstances of what constitutes a war crime can be fuzzy and disputed. The bombing of a hospital may appear to be an obvious war crime, but the attacker could argue that the bombing was unintentional, or that the building had been used by enemy troops, or that it had been storing weapons. Such assertions cannot be easily disproved in court. Just because civilians are killed in an armed conflict does not necessarily mean they were deliberately targeted.Genocide convictions are even harder to attain because they require an especially high burden of proof. While the evidence may be there — mass graves, razed villages, witness testimony, intercepted communications — prosecutors must show that the defendants were committing atrocities with the intent to destroy a particular group. That essentially requires getting inside the minds of the perpetrators.ImageThe hospital in Trostyanets, Ukraine, was shelled late last month, though during the town’s occupation by Russia it had treated wounded people on both sides of the fight.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesJurisdiction is another issue. Only 126 countries have ratified the Rome Statute — meaning the International Criminal Court’s authority to prosecute is generally limited to those countries, which conspicuously do not include Russia or Ukraine (or the United States). Ukraine has granted the court jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, which can proceed without the need for Russia’s consent. But prosecuting the crime of aggression would require consent from Russia, the aggressor, which legal scholars say the Kremlin would never provide.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Moreover, trials at the International Criminal Court require the defendants to be present. The court has no power to enforce its arrest warrants. The likelihood that Russia would extradite anyone to face such trials is extremely remote.Is the crime of aggression easier to prove than other crimes?Yes, and it is easier to prove the guilt of the people responsible. In the case of Ukraine, there is no dispute that Russia massed forces on the Ukrainian border for months and invaded on Feb. 24. It is clear that Mr. Putin and his immediate subordinates gave the orders. Many world leaders, including the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, have said Russia violated the U.N. Charter.“There’s no question an act of aggression was done,” said Alex Whiting, a visiting professor of international law at Harvard and a war-crimes prosecutor. “And the most straightforward case, in a crime of aggression, is against Putin himself.”Nonetheless, for now at least, the prospect that Mr. Putin or other Russian leaders would soon face criminal prosecution at an international court on such charges appears remote.Have other national leaders been prosecuted for war crimes?Yes, and those prosecutions took years. Slobodan Milosevic, the onetime leader of Serbia and Yugoslavia who presided over ethnic atrocities in the Balkan wars of the 1990s, was the first former head of state to be tried for war crimes, in 2002. He died in his cell in The Hague as his four-year trial in a special court drew to a close, before a verdict had been reached.ImageSlobodan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia, on trial in 2003 at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.Credit...Paul Vreeker/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesCharles G. Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was sentenced to 50 years in 2012 by a special court for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone during its civil war in the 1990s. Laurent Gbagbo, the former president of Ivory Coast, was acquitted at the International Criminal Court in 2019 of crimes against humanity and other charges related to violence that followed the country’s presidential election in 2010.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Libya’s former leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011 accusing him of crimes against humanity, but he was killed that October in Libya.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The Ukrainian judicial authorities have made clear they intend to prosecute criminal cases against Russians in Ukraine and elsewhere, including countries in Europe that have embraced universal jurisdiction — the legal principle that some crimes are so odious they are an affront to humanity at large, and therefore can be tried by any nation’s court system. On Thursday, the Ukraine prosecutor general’s office posted a graphic on Twitter accusing Russia of more than 6,400 crimes of aggression and war crimes since the invasion.There are some expectations that Ukraine and sympathetic countries at the United Nations or within the European Union may organize a special tribunal just for the purpose of prosecuting Russian leaders for the crime of aggression. The risks, critics of that approach say, are that such a court lacks the appearance of impartiality, that it would need enormous investment and preparation time, and that the defendants would never participate.Payam Akhavan, a law professor at the University of Toronto and a former prosecutor who was involved in the special tribunals created for war crime prosecutions in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, said a special tribunal for Ukraine would be a mistake.“This is not a Nuremberg moment,” Mr. Akhavan said, arguing that efforts would be better spent strengthening the International Criminal Court’s powers. “There is no need to reinvent the wheel.”Victoria Kim contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/world/europe/ukraine-war-crimes-trials.html
163,"A video released by Russia’s Ministry of Defense purporting to show dozens of uniformed crew members from the missile cruiser Moskva standing in formation, apparently days after the ship sank, did not answer lingering questions about the fate of the vessel and its more than 500 personnel.The questions reached the point Saturday where even Vladimir Solovyev, a popular prime-time talk-show host whose pronouncements often reflect the Kremlin line, began asking what went wrong.Mr. Solovyev, describing himself as “outraged” over the sinking, then asked a series of rhetorical questions that picked at both versions of how the Black Sea fleet vessel sank overnight on Wednesday.If the ship caught fire before sinking, as the Russians claim, then why did it not have a system to extinguish such blazes, the television host wondered aloud. If the ship was sunk by two Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles, as Ukrainian and unidentified U.S. Defense Department officials have claimed, then why did it lack an antimissile system?“Just explain to me how you managed to lose it,” Mr. Solovyev asked no one in particular on his Saturday show, Solovyev Live, when he has no guests in the studio.The segment was unusual not least because Mr. Solovyev broached the idea that Ukraine had managed to sink the Moskva, one of the biggest naval losses anywhere in the world since World War II.It comes as more pundits and other television talking heads in Russia have started referring to the fighting in Ukraine as a “war” — although they have tended to use the term when suggesting that the whole of NATO, including the United States, is ganging up on Russia. They do not describe Russia’s invasion itself as part of a war, nor do they mention the fact that the Kremlin started the conflict.The Kremlin squelched any open discussion about the conflict by promulgating a law in early March that criminalizes spreading any “false information” about what Russia calls its “special military operation,” including calling it a war, with violators facing up to 15 years in prison. Over all, official Russian media continues to refer to the invasion as a “special military operation,” even while expanding the definition of the enemy. One state paper last week referred to the enemy next door as “Ukrainian-American neo-Nazism.”While carefully scripted television news programs still use the “military operation” formula, guests in the heat of the shouting that is a trademark of Russian TV talk shows often yell about “war.”The even angrier tone than usual when discussing the sinking of the Moskva indicated that many commentators found Ukraine culpable. Skipping the official explanation that it caught fire, for example, Vladimir Bortko, a film director and former member of the Duma, Russia’s parliament, said on Thursday that the assault on the vessel should be treated as an assault on Russia itself.“The special military operation has ended, it ended last night when our motherland was attacked,” he said, after asking the other panelists to remind him what Russia was calling the war. “The attack on our territory is casus belli, an absolute cause for war for real.” He suggested that possible responses included bombing Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv; the transportation networks that allowed foreign dignitaries to visit; or something more sinister: “Bomb them once and that is it.”His ranting about war brought an admonition from Olga Skabaeeva, the host of the popular “60 Minutes” program, who said that he was talking in the context of NATO aggression against Russia. Some analysts think all the talk of NATO attacking Russia is meant to lay the groundwork for a possible general mobilization of the male population — martial law is a necessary prior step, and a declaration of martial law requires going to war or being under threat.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Until now, however, Russian news programs are not calling the events in Ukraine a war. They take their cues from the Ministry of Defense’s briefings. “It is all the presidential administration with their giant printer, there are no differences of opinion available,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst based in the United States. “They will not risk interpreting reports from the Ministry of Defense.”When it comes to the Moskva, Russian media reports have stuck to the official version promulgated by the ministry and echoed on TASS, a state news agency. That version held that a fire onboard had ignited an ammunition magazine, seriously damaging the Moskva, named for the Russian capital.After the crew of at least 510 men was evacuated, according to the ministry, the ship sank in rough seas while being towed back to Sevastopol, the fleet’s Crimean headquarters. Ukraine has said it struck the ship with two missiles and the vessel rapidly sank.The defense ministry posted a video on its official Telegram channel, as well as on the channel of its Zvezda television network, on Saturday, showing Adm. Nikolai Yevmenov, the commander of the Russian Navy, and other officers purportedly meeting with what it said were some Moskva crew members in Sevastopol.The 26-second clip showed the admiral addressing dozens of sailors, but there was no explanation about the fate of the rest. “The traditions of the missile cruiser Moskva will be carefully preserved and continued in the way it has always been accepted in the navy,” he said, adding that the crew would continue to serve elsewhere.Social media posts suggested that some of the crew members had died, but the toll is unclear. Videos posted online from an unofficial memorial service at a monument to the 300th anniversary of the Black Sea fleet showed a wreath with a ribbon bearing the inscription “To the ship and sailors.”Radio Liberty, a U.S. government network based outside Russia, reached the widow of one midshipman who confirmed his death and said that 27 crew members remained missing.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/europe/russia-ship-sinking-moskva.html
164,"Russia reorganized the command of its flagging offensive in Ukraine on Saturday, selecting for the mission a general accused of ordering strikes on civilian neighborhoods in Syria, as Western nations poured more weapons into the country in anticipation of a renewed Russian assault in the east.The appointment of the general, Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, as the top battlefield commander came as Britain announced that it was sending missiles that target aircraft, tanks and even ships, and as Slovakia handed the Ukrainian military a long-range S-300 air defense system, with the blessing of the United States.In another show of support for Ukraine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain made a surprise visit on Saturday to Kyiv, the capital, where he met with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and discussed a “new package of financial and military aid,” the British government said.Mr. Zelensky called on other Western leaders to similarly provide military aide to Ukraine and impose further sanctions on Russia. ImagePrime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom walking with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Saturday.Credit...Ukrainian Presidential Press Service, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Other Western democratic countries should follow the U.K.’s example,” Mr. Zelensky said after meeting with Mr. Johnson.The two leaders walked through the mostly empty cobbled streets of Kyiv in a show of confidence that the Ukrainian capital was now safe from Russian attacks. Outside a shop, one man warmly greeted them, thanking Mr. Johnson for Britain’s support in effusive Ukrainian as Mr. Zelensky translated. “In the last few weeks the world has found new heroes, and those heroes are the people of Ukraine,” said Mr. Johnson. “What Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin, his war crimes, have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his government,” he added. “There is a huge amount to do to make sure that Ukraine is successful, that Ukraine wins and that Putin fails.” The effort by Mr. Johnson to bolster Ukraine came as fears of a new Russian onslaught escalated. Despite its large army and considerable military might, Russia was unable to take Kyiv and now appears to be scrambling to retain dominance in Ukraine’s southeast, appointing a new commander for its offensive and withdrawing troops from the capital to an area where it has the advantage of support from local ethnic Russian separatists. “Russian forces continue to attempt to regroup and redeploy units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to support an offensive in eastern Ukraine, but these units are unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale,” said a report from the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank. Even so, Russia’s air campaign and missiles continue to cause grave damage. A missile attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Friday killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured many more who were heeding official warnings to flee.Moscow denied responsibility for the attack, but U.S. military officials and independent analysts in Washington said they believed Russian forces had launched the missiles.In a statement condemning the train station attack, the European Union said on Saturday that Russia was clearly culpable and that “attempts to hide Russia’s responsibility for this and other crimes using disinformation and media manipulations are unacceptable.”ImageUkrainian servicemen near the fragment of a missile near the Kramatorsk railway station on Friday.Credit...Andriy Andriyenko/Associated PressMr. Zelensky described the attack as “another war crime” and said it would be investigated, along with other atrocities attributed to Russian troops, including the apparent murders of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv.“Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen,” Mr. Zelensky said, calling for Russian commanders to face trials like those faced by the Nazis at Nuremberg after World War II.Japan said it would join the United States and European nations in supporting investigations and would expel eight Russian diplomats, ban Russian coal and restrict Russian imports of timber, vodka and machinery.Japan accused Russia of repeatedly attacking civilians and nuclear power plants, a sore point for Japan after the 2011 nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.“We must hold Russia strictly accountable for these atrocities,” the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said.ImageAn abandoned Russian checkpoint on a road to the Exclusion Zone near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesLegal experts have said that bringing war crimes charges against Kremlin officials would be difficult. The burden of proof is very high, requiring prosecutors to show that soldiers and their commanders intended to violate the international law that establishes the rules of war.Western analysts and European intelligence officials believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is trying to achieve battlefield gains by May 9, when he is planning to give a victory day speech commemorating both the Soviet victory in World War II and the military operation in Ukraine.On Saturday, Russian forces stepped up shelling in eastern Ukraine, with explosions reported in the Odesa and Kharkiv regions. The massing of Russian forces in the region, after they withdrew from areas around Kyiv, has prompted officials in the east to urge residents to flee. And thousands have.“The Russian troops are coming, so we are leaving to save our lives,” said Svitlana Kyrychenko, 47, who evacuated from Kramatorsk with her 18-year-old daughter, elderly mother and aunt on Saturday morning. She was at the train station in the central city of Dnipro, looking for a place to stay.“I brought nothing with me,” she said. “I only brought my documents and clothes to change into for a few days.”ImageNadiya Tokarchuk and her chilren arriving from Dnipro at the central train station in Lviv on Saturday.

He said that he expected about one-quarter of the city’s 200,000 residents to stay there, and was preparing food, water and medical supplies.“The only thing that will convince them to leave the city is if it comes under siege,” Mr. Honcharenko said.Fewer than 400 people had boarded buses out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, he said, presumably headed for areas to the west that are believed to to be safer.ImagePassengers boarding a bus in Kramatorsk on Saturday, part of a mass exodus ahead of an anticipated Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine.Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe European Commission on Saturday said that a global fund-raising effort called “Stand Up for Ukraine” had raised 9.1 billion euros, including 1 billion euros from the commission, for people fleeing the Russian invasion.More than seven million Ukrainians have left their homes since the invasion on Feb. 24, and more than 4.4 million have left the country altogether, in the fastest-moving exodus of European refugees since World War II, according to the United Nations.The appointment of General Dvornikov came as the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that tracks the fighting, said in its latest assessment that Russian forces in the east appeared to be stalled, and were “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale.”General Dvornikov was the first commander dispatched by Moscow to oversee Russian forces in Syria’s civil war in 2015 after the Kremlin intervened to shore up President Bashar al-Assad’s struggling military. General Dvornikov was there for about a year and was named a hero of the Russian Federation for his role. He oversaw forces that have been widely accused of bombing civilian neighborhoods, targeting hospitals and resorting to other scorched-earth tactics to break the back of the rebel movement that sought to oust Mr. al-Assad.ImageFirefighters and other workers cleared debris amid a search for bodies in the rubble of a destroyed apartment building in Borodianka, Ukraine, on Saturday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times“Bashar al-Assad is not the only one to be held accountable for killing civilians in Syria. The Russian general should, too,” said Rami Abdulrahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain. “As the commander of military operations, that means he’s behind killing Syrian civilians by giving the orders.”The actions of the Syrian government and Russian forces were widely decried by Western officials and human rights organizations, which said that some of their tactics amounted to war crimes. The commander of a Syrian Christian militia that received support from and fought alongside Russian forces in Syria said General Dvornikov was involved in battles in many parts of the country.“He was a real commander, very serious, proud of the Russian army and its military history,” the commander said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with journalists. Russia had been running its military campaign against Ukraine out of Moscow, with no central commander on the ground to coordinate air, ground and sea units. That approach helped to explain why the invasion struggled against an unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance, and was plagued by poor logistics and flagging morale, American officials said.The disorganized assault also contributed to the deaths of at least seven Russian generals, as high-ranking officers were pushed to the front lines to untangle tactical problems that Western militaries would have left to more junior officers or senior enlisted personnel.Eric Schmitt reported from Washington, Jane Arraf from Lviv, Ukraine, and Michael Levenson from New York.

165,"Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen urged China on Wednesday to persuade Russia to end its war in Ukraine and warned that staying on the sidelines could jeopardize China’s standing in the global economy.She spoke amid growing frustration from the United States and its allies that China has refused to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Instead the two countries have solidified a “special relationship.” The United States has been watching with concern to see if China will help Russia evade sanctions and stabilize its economy.“Going forward, it will be increasingly difficult to separate economic issues from broader considerations of national interest, including national security,” Ms. Yellen said in a speech to the Atlantic Council, a think tank. “The world’s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China’s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia.”Ms. Yellen added that Russia’s actions were at odds with China’s longstanding public commitments to sovereignty and territorial integrity and called on China to use its influence with Russia to end the war.Eswar Prasad, the International Monetary Fund’s former China director, said the United States was trying to put China on the spot with Ms. Yellen’s comments.“The U.S. is calling the Chinese government’s bluff in trying to have it both ways, claiming to be a protector of the global governance system while it stands on the sidelines as that system is being challenged by Russia’s naked aggression in Ukraine,” said Mr. Prasad, a professor of international trade policy at Cornell University.Ms. Yellen also said fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was casting a shadow over the global economy after two years of disruptions from the pandemic, but she insisted that the United States and its allies would continue to work together to confront Russia with debilitating sanctions.“The war between Russia and Ukraine has redrawn the contours of the world economic outlook,” Ms. Yellen said.She spoke ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund next week, when finance ministers from around the world will gather in Washington. After two years of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, those officials are now consumed with coordinating sanctions in an effort to cripple the Russian economy while helping their own countries cope with soaring inflation.In the speech, Ms. Yellen singled out countries, such as China and India, that have continued to engage with Russia despite the global backlash against the atrocities it has committed in Ukraine.The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.“Let me now say a few words to those countries who are currently sitting on the fence, perhaps seeing an opportunity to gain by preserving their relationship with Russia and backfilling the void left by others,” Ms. Yellen said. “Such motivations are shortsighted.”“And let’s be clear: The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place,” she continued.The United States and its allies in Europe and Asia have imposed sanctions on Russia’s central bank, its top financial institutions and its military supply chain. There is growing pressure to level sanctions on Russia’s energy industry, and some have argued that the United States must consider “secondary sanctions” on countries that do not comply with restrictions that the Biden administration has enacted on transactions.Referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, Ms. Yellen asserted that the United States did not intend to let up in its effort to strangle the Russian economy, saying, “Rest assured, until Putin ends his heinous war of choice, the Biden administration will work with our partners to push Russia further towards economic, financial and strategic isolation.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/business/yellen-war-global-economy.html
166,"State television programs in Russia have not shied away from showing images of death and destruction in Ukraine. Viewers have seen corpses in the streets of Bucha, blasted-out cars at a train station in Kramatorsk and the remains of a hospital complex attacked in Mariupol.But the images are accompanied by rhetoric that blames Ukraine or the West for the attacks, or accuses the Ukrainian government of falsification. The word “fake” is thrown around constantly — in some cases printed in bright red letters across gruesome videos and photos.When the first photos and videos of the slaughter in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, began emerging on April 3, Russian propagandists quickly responded by saying that the bodies in the streets were those of actors.“They call this evidence,” said a news host on Channel One. “This is yet another fake. The footage is staged.”On Telegram, an app with broadcasting capabilities, channels devoted to supposed “fakes” pump out the same message, falsely claiming, for example, that a closer look at a video of bodies strewn across Yablonska Street in Bucha shows one of the corpses raising an arm and another one standing up.One of the most popular news programs in the country, “60 Minutes” on the channel Russia-1, uses the English word fake liberally, stamping it on screenshots of articles published by the Western news media and on videos and photos from Ukraine.“There is no evidence of victims, but the West doesn’t need the truth,” the show’s host, Olga Skabeyeva, declared in one episode. As she spoke, huge screens in the studio behind her projected a video showing corpses in Bucha, with “fake” written in red in one corner.On Channel One, an entire program devoted to exposing “fakes” is hosted by Alexander Smol, who also hosts the Russian equivalent of “America’s Funniest Home Videos.”In each episode of “AntiFake,” Mr. Smol convenes three experts in history, military tactics, social media or data — usually men — to pick over the details of social media posts or articles about the war in Ukraine published in Western publications like The New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC and The Associated Press.Mr. Smol and his guests have argued that the scenes in Bucha must have been staged. There is not enough blood, they say. The bodies are positioned in different ways in photos, they claim.They have not limited their campaign to Bucha.In a recent episode, Mr. Smol broadcast a video of doctors trying unsuccessfully to revive a 6-year-old girl who was rushed to a hospital in Mariupol after a catastrophic shelling. The video was first released in late February by The A.P. and circulated on Ukrainian television and Western news media sites.As the video of the dying girl was played over and over — the word “fake” stamped across it — the men on Mr. Smol’s show said it had been shot from too many angles and in too smooth a manner to be real. And they said a camera operator would not be allowed into an emergency room.Mr. Smol and others on his program have also echoed the state narrative that Ukrainian forces were behind the attacks on the hospital complex in Mariupol — a strike that killed a pregnant woman and wounded staff and maternity ward patients — and the train station in Kramatorsk, which left at least 50 people dead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/russian-media-atrocities-fake.html

168,"IN POLAND, NEAR THE UKRAINIAN BORDER — Just off a runway on a Polish airfield, forklifts busily emptied an Air Force C-17 transport jet of its cargo alongside a much smaller civilian propeller-driven plane, ferrying pallets of green boxes full of munitions from each to a nearby asphalt parking lot filling up with many dozens of them.Some bore American-made weapons, while others held a variety of ordnance made in Eastern Europe — all of them representative of Ukraine’s highest priorities for military aid that would soon be loaded into a fleet of waiting tractor-trailer trucks loitering nearby for the journey into Ukraine.The Pentagon sources much of the American-made weaponry it sends to Kyiv from its own stockpiles, but relies on American defense contractors to scour Eastern European munitions factories to find newly made weapons designed by the United States’ former adversary, the Soviet Union, to fulfill President Biden’s pledges of increased military aid for Ukraine.Ukraine still uses many weapons common to the Russian army, such as modern Kalashnikovs. And while Ukraine’s pleas for more sophisticated weaponry — such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger antiaircraft missiles — have received widespread attention, the country’s military has pressing needs for a wide range of munitions, including tens of millions of rounds for Soviet-era arms that are not on the cutting edge but are staples of the Ukrainian military.The Pentagon calls such arms, including rockets, artillery shells and ammunition for machine guns and assault rifles, “nonstandard ammunition” — given that the munitions are incompatible with those used by the United States and many allied nations, which are generally known as NATO-standard ammunition.And since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Pentagon has been buying large amounts of such weapons through a variety of American defense firms to supply client armies in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other countries that still rely on Soviet-designed arms.One of those companies is the Ultra Defense Corp. in Tampa, Fla., which has about 60 employees and has built a bustling business working with factories in Romania, Bosnia, Serbia, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Bulgaria.Those countries provide about 90 percent of the nonstandard ammunition purchased by the Pentagon, according to Matthew Herring, the company’s owner, though his firm provides just a fraction of the Pentagon’s total orders.Mr. Herring, who bought the company in 2011 when it was a three-person firm providing Russian-made helicopters to Afghan forces, is now in Poland meeting with Ukrainian officials to find out what else his company can do to provide them with Eastern Bloc munitions.“A month ago, when Kyiv was surrounded, it was, ‘What do we need in the next 48 hours?’” Mr. Herring said. “But now the Ukrainians are digging in for a long fight and it’s, ‘How do we get enough to sustain us in this fight?’”“So it’s a longer view about what they now need,” he added.The Pentagon’s nonstandard ammunition program was built in direct response to an investigation by The New York Times in 2008 that exposed illegal sales of Chinese-made arms to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, which became the subject of the 2016 movie “War Dogs.”According to Mr. Herring, after that scandal, the Pentagon contracted with large defense firms to provide nonstandard ammunition for Afghanistan and later allowed small companies like his to offer bids for the same kinds of services.Whether certain European nations that still make Soviet-designed munitions will sell their wares to Ukraine is a political decision — one that may depend in part on whether they value maintaining a good relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, a former Army Ranger who serves on the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said in an interview last week that much of Ukraine’s nonstandard ammunition “very rapidly will be depleted” because of the current pace of combat with Russia.The Ukrainian military will ultimately need to transition to NATO-standard weapons in the future, he said, so that it can further take advantage of the West’s vast stockpiles of ammunition sitting in bunkers across Europe and the United States.That move is already underway, in part, through the Pentagon’s provision of five battalions’ worth of 155-mm howitzers to fulfill Ukraine’s pressing needs for what it calls long-range fires, which are similar in capability to the Soviet-designed 152-millimeter guns that Ukraine has been using against Russia.So while businesses like the Ultra Defense Corp. will still buy as many 152-millimeter artillery shells as it can for Ukraine’s legacy artillery weapons, the Pentagon is aggressively moving in 184,000 shells from its stockpile in Europe for the 155-millimeter howitzers it has pulled from Army and Marine Corps stockpiles in the United States and shipped to Kyiv.At a news briefing last week, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said nonstandard ammunition remained an important part of the supply of arms the United States is providing Ukraine.“It’s the lifeblood here for the Ukrainian armed forces,” Mr. Kirby said of the ammunition supplies being given to Kyiv. “We don’t talk a lot about small arms ammunition. It doesn’t get the headlines, I understand that, but at every discussion we have with the Ukrainians, they talk about how important that is.”Since the invasion, he said, the United States has coordinated and delivered more than 50 million rounds of small arms ammunition to Ukraine, much of it Soviet-designed. Mr. Kirby said the United States was continuing to “talk to allies and partners about their inventories of nonstandard ammunition” in an effort to get more munitions to Ukraine.“It is having a truly significant impact on the battlefield,” he said of the Soviet-designed ordnance. “They use that ammunition literally every day in defending their country.”John Ismay reported from an undisclosed location in Poland near the Ukrainian border and Eric Schmitt from Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/us/ukraine-pentagon-arms-buyers.html
169,"Social media give us responses to the Russian invasion of Ukraine almost instantly, but some of the most moving responses I’ve seen come from the young Ukrainian artists who’ve managed to make new work documenting events as they unfold.What follows are four accounts run by Ukrainian artists — one currently in Austria, and three still in the country — and one by Ukrainian Americans, all working to keep the world’s attention on what’s happening on the ground.I’ve also been following the wave of relief efforts centered in New York, among them the Moldovan-born artist Alexandra Borovski’s sale of beautiful, obsessive ink drawings to help the American artist Clemens Poole ferry relief supplies from Poland. A collective called Spilka, co-founded by the Ukrainian American multimedia artist Betty Roytburd, is reaching isolated Ukrainians overlooked by larger aid groups — and organizing Ukrainian-food-themed fund-raisers in Bushwick, Brooklyn.Ekaterina Lisovenko @lisovenko_ekaterinaThe painter Ekaterina Lisovenko recently took on the Russian slogan “mozhem povtorit,” literally, “we can repeat,” which refers to the Soviet victory over the Nazis in World War II and has been revived in the hopes of convincing Russian people that the war in Ukraine is a similarly heroic undertaking. Lisovenko posted a single image four times. Captioned as “a raped and murdered woman and her murdered child,” the supine, yellowish, slightly abstracted figures on a dark gray ground are assigned to four different Russian invasions — the current one; the 2014 incursions into the Donbas region; the 2008 invasion of the Republic of Georgia; and the first Chechen war. It’s a shocking, extremely effective way to remind us what’s really at stake when we talk about sanctions, negotiations and troop movements.Asia Bazdyrieva @asiabazdyrievaFor the last six or seven weeks, the writer Asia Bazdyrieva has been keeping a mostly English-language online diary from somewhere outside Kyiv. Posted in white sans-serif letters on a black background — like iPhone notes adjusted for low light — the diary captures the mind-bending dissonance of life in a war zone. One entry notes that Bazdyrieva has slept for seven hours, delivered Molotov cocktail supplies to the Territorial Defense Forces, and repotted a plant; another, which uses the phrase “Russian roulette,” is captioned “Felt cute might delete later.” The different tones are impossible to reconcile, and that’s exactly what makes the diary so evocative.Andrey Rachinskiy @andrey_rachinskiyBefore the invasion, the new media artist Andrey Rachinskiy was making photo and video work about the stranger corners of post-Soviet reality with his longtime collaborator Daniil Revkovskiy, like one fascinating investigation into the duel between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian graffiti in their native city of Kharkiv. Now Rachinskiy is in Lviv, buying piles of food, diapers and medical supplies to send home — and keeping account of the piles with handsome, heartbreaking photographs. His feed is also a good place to find some of the billboards Ukraine has erected for its invaders, like the one telling them, “We are on our land, but you will be in it.”Ukrainian Modernism @ukrainianmodernismBefore the war, this popular account run by the photographer and educator Dmytro Soloviov was dedicated to celebrating the sharp corners and enormous chandeliers of Ukraine’s grandest 20th century buildings. Now it’s chronicling their violent destruction, as well as fund-raising for the preservation of cultural properties, like this stained glass in the Kyiv Funicular — and promoting the architectural tours Soloviov is conducting even now. Images of bombed out buildings, unfortunately, are easy enough to find, but the context of Soloviov’s account makes them into something slightly different. He’s not only adding to the record of airstrikes on apartment buildings and other civilian targets, as important as that is. He’s also found a way of picturing the harder to reckon with cultural damage that comes with loss of life and property.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine.

170,"Pink Floyd, the 1970s psychedelic rock band, is releasing its first new track in almost three decades on Friday to raise money for the people of Ukraine, the band said on Thursday.The recording, “Hey Hey Rise Up,” is a reworking of a protest song from World War I and features the Ukrainian rock star Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the band Boombox.Mr. Khlyvnyuk was on tour in the United States when the war started and returned to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, to enlist in his country’s army. The vocals on the Pink Floyd track come from a viral video the Ukrainian singer posted three days into the war of himself clad in combat gear, carrying a rifle and singing a Ukrainian protest anthem in Kyiv’s Sofiyskaya Square.The anthem, “The Red Viburnum in the Meadow,” was written during World War I and has been sung at Ukrainian solidarity rallies around the world since Russia’s invasion began. Pink Floyd gives it a soaring rock treatment, with David Gilmour providing an anguished guitar solo and Nick Mason’s steady drums driving it forward. Guy Pratt plays bass, and Nitin Sawhney adds keyboard. Roger Waters, who left the group in 1985, was not involved.The anthem’s last line, “Hey, hey, rise up and rejoice,” was the inspiration for the track’s title. Though an initial statement said proceeds from its sale would go to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, a spokesperson for the band said on Friday that a specific charity had not yet been designated. Mr. Gilmour said Mr. Khlyvnyuk had given his blessing for the song from the hospital where he is recovering from a mortar shrapnel injury.Mr. Gilmour described coming to know Mr. Khlyvnyuk in 2015, when Boombox backed him at a show in support of a persecuted Belarusian theater group.Both Pink Floyd and Mr. Gilmour, who has Ukrainian family members, pulled their music from digital providers in Russia and Belarus in March and said they stood with the world in “strongly condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”The move was one of several solidarity efforts from the music industry in recent weeks.

172,"The United States’ top diplomat and top defense official arrived in Kyiv on Sunday, a Ukrainian official said, following other world leaders who have visited the embattled capital over two months of war to signal their support for Ukraine.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, becoming the first senior U.S. officials known to have visited Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The visit was confirmed by Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky, in an interview with a Russian lawyer and activist on YouTube. “They’re right now in Kyiv, talking to the president,” Mr. Arestovich said. “Maybe something will be decided regarding how they can help.”The Biden administration has backed Ukraine with aid and weaponry, and has helped lead an international campaign of sanctions against Russia. But it had been under growing pressure to send a high-level official to Kyiv after recent visits there by several European officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, who walked the streets with Mr. Zelensky, and the prime ministers of Spain and Denmark.U.S. officials did not announce the visit, but Mr. Zelensky revealed it in a speech on Saturday, saying he would use the meeting to discuss “the military assistance we need.” The Pentagon and State Department did not immediately comment.Mr. Blinken was the last high-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine when he stopped there in mid-January. The United States closed its embassy in Kyiv on Feb. 14 and its diplomats soon left the country.Russia’s invasion began 10 days later, and as it tried to seize the capital in an initial offensive, parts of Kyiv were struck by shelling and Ukrainian and Russian forces fought in the streets of Kyiv’s suburbs. But Russia’s retreat from the area around Kyiv appears to have made the city far less dangerous than it was a few weeks ago, and Western leaders have been taking the opportunity to demonstrate solidarity with Mr. Zelensky.In March, only a few weeks after Russia’s invasion, the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv on a mission that was kept tightly under wraps. Over the following weeks, they were followed by leaders of Britain, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Estonia, Spain and Denmark. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, visited both Kyiv and Bucha, where in the wake of Russia’s retreat journalists and investigators have found evidence of atrocities.In March, Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Poland, where she expressed American support for Ukraine and U.S. allies in NATO and the European Union. Mr. Blinken went as far as Poland’s border with Ukraine, meeting with Ukrainian diplomats at a crossing used by hundreds of refugees over the course of an hour.President Biden also visited a town near the border on a state visit to Poland on March 25, but did not cross into Ukraine. He met with refugees and gave a speech in Warsaw the next day.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

173,"WARSAW — A leading human rights group said it had documented “apparent war crimes” by Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians in the occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions in Ukraine.The report, which was published by Human Rights Watch on Sunday, is based on a series of interviews with eye witnesses, victims and local residents of Russia-occupied territories between Feb. 27 and March 14. It documents with chilling detail numerous cases of laws-of-war violations, including repeated rape, two summary killings as well as other incidents of unlawful violence and threats against civilians.“The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, the director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.”The report’s findings did not include reports of actions in recent weeks in towns like Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, where Russian troops have been pulling back in recent days as part of their retreat from the capital.War crimes cases can be brought before the International Criminal Court in the Hague, but successful prosecution would be challenging, experts say.“It would likely be difficult to prove in court,’’ said David Scheffer, an international law expert. “The circumstances are unknown. Who executed them. Who bound their hands. This would require a very difficult and detailed investigation.’’“This is very different from a military strike on a city,’’ he said.Accusations can also be brought before the International Court of Justice, but the United Nations Security Council would be responsible for enforcing any ruling against Russia; as one of five members of the Security Council, Russia would have veto power over any decision.The Human Rights Watch report comes as global outrage against Moscow mounted on Sunday following allegations that Russian forces had executed civilians in Ukraine, and as the retreat of Russian troops from the suburbs of Kyiv offered a stark picture of the devastating toll of President Vladimir V. Putin’s six-week-old war.The brutality of the scenes are mirrored by some of the accounts from the report: One eyewitness from the town of Bucha described an execution there in early March, in which Russian soldiers forced five men to kneel on a roadside and pull their shirts over their heads before shooting one in the back of the head.In another case, a 31-year-old woman described being beaten and raped repeatedly by a Russian soldier in a local school in Kharkiv, where she had been sheltering with her family. “I am lucky to be alive,” she said.“The cases that we documented are corroborated by these recent allegations,” said Yulia Gorbunova, the author of the Human Rights Watch report, referring to the recent reports circulating from Bucha. “What is emerging now, if confirmed, is quite horrendous and gives an indication of the scale of these atrocities,” she said.Marlise Simons contributed reporting from Paris.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/world/europe/russia-war-crimes-ukraine.html
174,"Every morning, Olga Boichak’s grandmother wakes up at her home in western Ukraine, turns on the television and discovers anew that her country is at war.Panicked and flashing back to childhood memories of bombings during World War II, she starts packing to evacuate, her granddaughter said. Her husband of six decades hides the house keys and reassures her everything will be all right, and that their home is the safest place for them.Before long, the war, the fear and the reassurance will dissipate into the fog of dementia — as have all new memories in recent years. Until the next morning, or the next air raid siren, when the reality of the invasion that has subsumed Ukraine for more than 50 days will find her once more.“She’s going through the daily trauma of rediscovering that war has begun, and keeps trying to evacuate,” Dr. Boichak, who is based in Sydney and speaks to her grandparents and her aunt, a health care worker who looks after them, weekly over video chat. She declined to give her grandparents’ names or their exact location in relatively safe western Ukraine out of concern for their safety.“It’s really heartbreaking,” she said.In nearly two months of war, many Ukrainians who are young and able-bodied have left the country or taken up arms. Many who are elderly, infirm or disabled have stayed behind, unable to make the journey or unwilling to leave the surroundings set up for their needs.Dementia in particular is a “hidden” disability that can result in patients being left out of humanitarian assistance or protection from responders, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International, an umbrella organization for groups around the world. Even before Russia’s invasion in February, the war in Ukraine’s eastern separatist regions had disproportionately affected elderly Ukrainians.For Dr. Boichak’s grandparents, who are in their late 80s, childhood memories of being forced to flee amid Soviet shelling made them all the more attached to their home, and her grandfather is determined to stay despite their children and grandchildren’s pleas, she said. Her grandfather, a retired physician, felt strongly about spending his final years in the home they spent decades rebuilding and where her grandmother, a retired architect, tended to a garden for years growing tomatoes, zucchini and carrots, Dr. Boichak said.On day 41 of the war, Dr. Boichak, a sociologist and lecturer who has been researching the role of social media in shaping narratives about war and military violence, beginning with Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, posted her grandparents’ story on Twitter. She described how her grandmother had been caught in a “never-ending loop.”To her surprise, her tweet appeared to resonate around the world; more than 44,000 people liked the post.Among the people moved by their story was Liza Vovchenko, who immediately thought of her own grandmother in a Russian-occupied town in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine.ImageLiza Vovchenko and her grandmother Rita in 2012.Credit...via Liza VovchenkoFor weeks after the Russian soldiers took control, her 82-year-old grandmother, Rita, kept trying to go on her daily walks to the market in the town center even though the streets were no longer safe.

Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.“Her normal routine was impacted, and people like her really need routine in their lives,” said Ms. Vovchenko, who lives in Paris and speaks on the phone with her grandmother and the cousin who lives with her. Without her daily walks and conversations with friends and neighbors she sees along the way, and without her medication, her grandmother’s condition has been worsening, she said.The family has tried to keep her from the television, on which all Ukrainian programming has been replaced by a stream of Russian propaganda. She is running out of the pages of Sudoku she enjoys doing.Particularly painful for the family was having to keep the kitchen, which, like in many Soviet-era homes, is in a stand-alone building, locked. Her grandmother, a skilled cook who loves to bake pies with cherries, apples and plums from her garden, has repeatedly tried to prepare elaborate meals, not realizing the family needed to ration dwindling supplies of food.Last week, the family ended up evacuating her grandmother from the village where she was born in 1940, as fighting intensified along the eastern front, according to Ms. Vovchenko.Among her friends and contacts across Ukraine, stories abound of elderly relatives who are disabled or weak urging the young to leave them behind and get themselves to safety, she said.“To the young people who are able to escape, the older ones would push you to run,” she said. They say: “I will die here because it’s my land. I want to make sure you leave, and can come back and rebuild this country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/world/dementia-grandparent.html
175,"Produced by ‘The Ezra Klein Show’Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only getting more brutal: We’ve seen the bodies of civilians strewn in the streets in Bucha, the city of Mariupol almost leveled and, just a few days ago, a Russian missile attack on a crowded train station in Kramatorsk killing at least 50 people. The United Nations has confirmed 1,793 civilian deaths in Ukraine, though the actual number is thought to be far higher.Russia’s viciousness in this campaign makes Ukraine’s resilience all the more remarkable. Ukrainians have defied expectations in staving off Russia’s far larger army and holding cities like Kyiv that some believed might fall within days of an invasion. Much of the commentary in recent weeks has revolved around what this war has revealed about Russia: its myths, its military, its leadership, its threat. What’s no less important, though, is what this war has revealed about Ukraine.[You can listen to this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]Ukrainians have modeled a deep commitment to self-determination and shown how far they would go to protect it. The Ukrainian philosopher and editor Volodymyr Yermolenko has written that “freedom is the key trait of Ukraine’s identity as a political nation,” and Ukraine’s resistance testifies to how deep that trait runs.Yermolenko is a philosopher, the editor in chief of UkraineWorld and the editor of the essay collection “Ukraine in Histories and Stories.” I invited Yermolenko onto the show to help me understand how Ukraine has defined itself in relation to the political behemoths to its east and west: Russia and Europe. Our conversation also explores what it has felt like to be in Kyiv as Russian troops have shelled the city, how definitions of time and home change during war, what has — and hasn’t — surprised Yermolenko about the Ukrainian resistance, what people in the West may not understand about the cultural differences between Ukraine and Russia, why Ukraine’s political structure makes it so difficult to conquer, how Ukraine is reminding the West why its republican and humanistic values matter, what Yermolenko would say to President Biden if he could and more.You can listen to our whole conversation by following “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.

178,"LVIV, Ukraine — Christian Borys was at home in Toronto in February trying to find a way to help Ukrainians threatened by war when he decided to print some stickers from an internet meme: the Virgin Mary hoisting an antitank missile.Mr. Borys, who had worked for the e-commerce platform Shopify before turning to journalism, said he created a website in half an hour, hoping to raise money to send to a charity for Ukrainian orphans. That night, he made 88 Canadian dollars in sales. By the time he added T-shirts at the end of February, the threat of war had turned into a full-scale invasion, and he said sales grew to 170,000 Canadian dollars a day — most coming from the United States.“The internet speaks in memes and it just became this crazy, viral sensation,” he said. “I think it’s because people were looking for a symbol of support, a way to support Ukraine, because they saw the whole injustice of everything.”Images such as Ukrainian tractors towing away a disabled Russian tank and helicopter, although unverified, have not only helped fight Russian disinformation, but also helped support Ukrainian charities and even the Ukrainian military.ImageChristian Borys with some of the T-shirts and stickers sold by his company.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesThe merchandise sales they have generated in the United States and elsewhere are surprising given that many people buying the T-shirts, stickers, coffee mugs and chocolate bars would never have thought about the Eastern European country before the conflict.Mr. Borys’s site, Saint Javelin, has raised so far almost $1.5 million to assist the Ukrainian charity Help Us Help, which has branched into multiple services, and to provide protective equipment for journalists covering the war, he said.“I think it’s unprecedented,” said Peter Dickinson, editor of the UkraineAlert service at the Atlantic Council, speaking about the internet-generated support. “We’ve got to bear in mind that this is a technological thing as well, that we’re at the point where the tools are in place.”When Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the invasion received far less attention in the West. This time, President Biden’s warning in mid-February that Russia was days away from invading Ukraine brought thousands of journalists rushing in, and the news dominated the headlines.“Russia had been very successful in the past about putting out all sorts of information about Ukraine because nobody really knew much about Ukraine,” Mr. Dickinson said. “It was like a blank slate.”That quickly changed starting in February when Ukraine was seen as the clear underdog against a much more powerful invader. Crowdfunding efforts sprung up — raising millions of dollars for the Ukrainian military, including through cryptocurrency — when European allies at first would not send more arms to the country to avoid inflaming the fighting.ImageNatalia Taldykin, 36, trying on a T-shirt by Aviatsiya Halychyny in Lviv, Ukraine, on Friday.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesNow the overwhelming public image of Ukraine, boosted by memes and merchandise, is of a plucky country that, against all odds, is turning the tide of war.“This is about the spirit of our fight and our struggle,” said Taras Maselko, marketing director for the clothing company Aviatsiya Halychyny, which sells T-shirts under a category called “Fight Like Ukrainians.” Mr. Maselko said 20 percent of the orders came from outside Ukraine.“You know if you are wearing a T-shirt, if you are reading something on social media, it brings you to the reality of what is going on in Ukraine,” he said.The clothing brand’s biggest seller is a T-shirt with the now-famous, vulgar response that Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, an outpost in the Black Sea, gave to a Russian warship that had ordered him and his unit to surrender.The response is a rallying call, with all its vulgarity, put up on billboards in Ukraine and chanted by children and their parents at protests outside the country.This week, Ukraine’s postal service unveiled a stamp depicting a Ukrainian navy special forces operator with his middle finger raised at the warship. It plans to launch a website to sell the stamps, coffee cups and other merchandise.The Russian warship, called the Moskva, sank on Thursday after Ukraine fired Neptune missiles at it, according to U.S. officials. The Russian government denied that it was attacked and said that it was disabled when a fire broke out.ImageStamps released by the Ukrainian postal service showing a Ukrainian navy special forces operator with his middle finger raised at Moskva, the Russian missile cruiser, which recently sank.Credit...Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersThe head of the Ukrainian post office called the stamp “a symbol of courage and indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people in the fight against Russia.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

But Mr. Smelyansky, who is Ukrainian American, said the opportunity to demoralize Russia was priceless.“As the postal service we are always happy when the addressee gets the message,” he said.Humor amid adversity runs deep in Ukrainian culture. Before being elected president three years ago, President Volodymyr Zelensky was a comedian. A famous Russian painting depicts the Zaporozhian Cossacks, in what is now Ukraine, laughing uproariously as they draft a profanity-laced letter to the 17th-century sultan of the Ottoman Empire who demanded that they submit to him.In the current wartime, shops in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv sell chocolate bars with images of Mr. Zelensky. Another has the president’s adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, depicted as a television sitcom character saying, “Everything will be fine.”Aviatsiya Halychyny, the clothing company, continues to produce the T-shirts in Lviv.

Mr. Shaw based that painting on an earlier work in 2012 with the Madonna holding a Kalashnikov rifle.Mr. Borys acknowledges that some people may find the image blasphemous.“People definitely get offended but the vast, vast majority of people see what it actually stands for,” he said. “Religious symbolism has been used in war for hundreds of years.

Putin of Russia “a butcher” on Saturday, in response to a question after meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw, including several from Mariupol, the city that has been flattened by days of shelling from Russian forces.Asked what he thinks of Mr. Putin and of what has happened in Mariupol, Mr. Biden said simply: “He’s a butcher.”His comment came as he visited a stadium in Warsaw where the Polish authorities are assisting the waves of people who are fleeing Ukraine. He shook hands and exchanged comments with people as they crowded around him. At one point, he picked up a little girl with a pink jacket and brown pigtails and took a selfie with her.Each one of the children, Mr. Biden said, asked for him to pray “for my dad, or my grandfather, and my brother,” who remain in Ukraine. Biden’s comment drew a quick response. A spokesman for Mr. Putin, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the TASS, the state-owned news agency, that personal insults such as this “narrow down the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration.”Poland has received more than two million refugees, by far the largest number of the more than 3.5 million who have fled the fighting.On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would send another $1 billion to help Poland and the other eastern allies with the humanitarian crisis, bringing the total American aid to more than $2 billion since the run up to the invasion of Ukraine.Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Biden told President Andrzej Duda of Poland that he recognizes the burden his country is under and promised that the American people will continue to provide assistance for the Ukrainian people.“We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on significant responsibility,” he said. “I don’t think it should just be Poland. It should be the whole world, all of NATO’s responsibility.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/biden-putin-butcher-poland-refugees.html
180,"After the deadly strike on the train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, those who stayed behind are grim about the future: “We think we will be swept off the face of the earth.”By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia YermakPhotographs by Tyler HicksApril 10, 2022KRAMATORSK, Ukraine — Two days after more than 50 people were killed on its platforms by a missile strike, the only sounds at the Kramatorsk railway station on Sunday morning were a distant air-raid siren and the rhythmic sweeping of broken glass.“The town is dead now,” said Tetiana, 50, a shopkeeper who was working next to the station when it was attacked as thousands of people tried to board trains to evacuate the eastern city, fearing it would soon be besieged by Russian forces.Friday’s strike was a gruesome turn for the city after nearly eight years of being near the front line of the country’s struggle against Russia-backed separatists in the region known as Donbas.The station’s main hall was still filled with streaks of blood and luggage on Sunday morning, with the burned-out hulks of two sedans lying in the parking area outside.ImageLuggage remaining Sunday at the bloodied train station in Kramatorsk, where about 50 people were killed Friday in a Russian attack.Tetiana, who declined to provide her last name, was sure that more death was on the way.“We are being encircled. We understand that,” added Tetiana, who has lived for 10 years in Kramatorsk, a city with a prewar population of around 150,000 people and once one of the industrial hearts of the Donbas. She said she would not leave because she must look after her 82-year-old mother, who is ailing. But she knows more than ever the danger that brings.“We think we will be swept off the face of the earth,” she said.She recalled ducking inside a nearby market on Friday to take cover when the missile struck the train station, with what she estimated was 2,000 people inside. A family that took shelter with her at the market was almost crushed by a piece of a falling roof that was sheared off in the blast.“There were screams everywhere,” she said. “Nobody could understand anything, cars were burning and people were running.”With Moscow’s decision to shift the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, the people who remain in Kramatorsk fear that they will soon be shelled into oblivion, like the residents of Kharkiv and Mariupol, two other cities that have been ruthlessly assaulted by Russian forces. It feels like an assault here is inevitable: Cutting off Kramatorsk would partly cut off Ukrainian forces fighting in the eastern breakaway regions where Russia is consolidating.ImageDamage at the train station in Kramatorsk, where residents have started to hunker down, expecting a Russian siege.At the city’s main hospital, City Hospital 3, the staff was preparing for the kind of destruction that has swept over other urban centers. Their supplies for mass trauma are ample, one doctor said. But, he added, many of the nurses have evacuated and there was a shortage of critical care physicians.In Kramatorsk, residents have started to hunker down, preparing for a siege. Most small shops have been closed, a few grocery stores remain open and the city square, once teeming with people during these warm spring days, is all but empty.Just after noon on Sunday, Tetiana closed the small candy and coffee confectionery where she worked. It would be shuttered for the foreseeable future, as its main source of income, the train station’s passengers, were gone.Still, orange-vested maintenance workers tried to clean around the wreckage from the strike: parts of the train station itself, people’s shoes, a bag of potatoes and broken glass. A pack of stray dogs, frequent visitors to the area around the station, limped around the debris. The workers swept where they could until a water truck arrived, hosing down the blood that had pooled by the outside entrance.In the distance, the thud of artillery reverberated, barely loud enough to hear but still easily felt.ImageCleaning up debris on Sunday from the missile strike. Most small shops in Kramatorsk had shut down and the city square was all but empty.“We’re closing down,” Tetiana said. “There is no point. There are no people.”Evacuation vehicles were still leaving the city but not at the volume they had in the days before. One resident said that buses sent from western Ukraine were already leaving unfilled. Those who were staying in Kramatorsk, many of them older residents, were bracing what may lie ahead: making do without electricity, living in cold damp basements, cooking by fire and enduring the terror of incoming artillery fire.But on Sunday, Lidia, 65, and Valentyna, 72, dear friends, dressed in nice clothes and decided to leave their lifelong homes together. Both women declined to provide their surnames.“After what happened at the railway station, we can hear the explosions getting closer and closer,” Lidia said. Through tears, Valentyna added, “I can’t take these sirens anymore.” Their destination, as with millions of other Ukrainians since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, was somewhere vaguely west — just anywhere farther away.“We need to leave because we can’t bear it anymore,” Lidia said.ImageThe train station on Sunday. For many Kramatorsk residents, a waiting game has begun. “We think we will be swept off the face of the earth,” one woman said.Air-raid sirens in Kramatorsk are not the haunting, distant chorus you hear in the movies. They are, in most cases, just a loud single horn that seems inescapable, whether indoors or out. And if any kind of strike occurs, the sirens usually come afterward, too late, residents complained.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Kramatorsk and the neighboring, but smaller, city of Sloviansk are likely to be the first two cities that will be attacked by whatever Russian forces are able to reconstitute in the region following their defeat and withdrawal from around Kyiv, the capital. For now, the Russian front line traces like a jaw around the two cities.Encircling and cutting off Kramatorsk and Sloviansk would allow the Russians to isolate the Ukrainian forces that are holding their old front lines in the two breakaway regions — a maneuver, if successfully carried out, that would mean disaster for the Ukrainian military, as much of their forces are there.Sgt. Andriy Mykyta, a soldier in Ukraine’s border guard, was in Kramatorsk to try to head off that fate.ImageAn apartment building heavily damaged by recent Russian bombings in Kramatorsk on Sunday.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“There will be a serious fight,” Sergeant Mykyta said. “This is a tactic of the Russians: They take cities as hostages.”On Sunday, as he bought an energy drink and some snacks from one of the remaining open grocery stores in the city, the sergeant looked much like every other uniformed Ukrainian service member: a blue stripe on his arm, weathered boots and a jagged tattoo jutting above his collar.But he was, in fact, one of the most valuable members of the Ukrainian armed forces, a part of the select group that was quickly trained by NATO forces (a several-day course that was supposed to last at least a month, he said) to use some of the more complicated weapons that were helping push back Russian forces: the Javelin and NLAW antitank systems.But he played down the missile systems’ importance, saying, “These weapons are like a doughnut at the end of the day.” He said that the real fight would come down to whatever side could withstand its enemy’s artillery the longest and who retained the will to fight.ImageA Ukrainian soldier patrolling the train station on Sunday.“They have tanks and artillery, but their troops are demoralized,” he said.Maria Budym, a 69-year-old resident of Kramatorsk, shrugged off the artillery and the evacuations. She was staying. When Russian-backed separatists briefly held Kramatorsk in 2014, they were welcomed to the city by some of the pro-Russian population before being driven off by Ukrainian defenders, she said.This time, she added, the Russians will have to deal with her.“Only cowards and people already displaced by the war have fled the city,” she said, standing in a blue fleece pullover in front of her hollowed-out Soviet-style apartment. “Our soldiers will defend this city to their last breath.”Besides, Ms. Budym added, with anger in her eyes: “I have a pipe in my apartment. I’ll use it on whoever comes in that door.”ImageAn apartment building that was damaged Friday. “We are being encircled. We understand that,” said one woman, who planned to stay in Kramatorsk to care for her ailing mother.Tyler Hicks contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/asia/ukrainian-kramatorsk.html

182,"NAIROBI, Kenya — First came the drought, drying up rivers, and claiming the lives of two of Ruqiya Hussein Ahmed’s children as her family fled the barren countryside in southwest Somalia.Then came the war in Ukraine, pushing food prices so high that even after making it to the outskirts of the capital, Mogadishu, she is struggling to keep her two other children alive.“Even here, we have nothing,” she said.Across East Africa, below-average rainfall has created some of the driest conditions in four decades, according to the United Nations, leaving more than 13 million people facing severe hunger. Seasonal harvests have hit their lowest in decades, malnourished children are filling hospitals and many families are walking long distances to find help.The devastating drought has blanketed most of Somalia, leaving nearly a third of the population hungry. In neighboring Kenya, the drought has left more than three million people short of food and killed more than 1.5 million livestock.ImageThe Iftin Camp for internally displaced people outside Baradere town, in Somalia’s Jubaland state, in March.Credit...Feisal Omar/ReutersAnd in Ethiopia, where a civil war has impeded aid delivery into the northern Tigray region, food insecurity is more widespread than at any time in the last six years. The first food aid to Tigray in three months arrived on Friday. Now, the war in Ukraine is making the crisis even worse by raising the price of grains, fuel and fertilizer.Russia and Ukraine are some of the region’s top suppliers of agricultural commodities such as wheat, soybeans and barley. At least 14 African countries import half of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Eritrea depends on them entirely for its wheat imports.“The conflict in Ukraine is compounding an already complicated situation in East Africa,” Gabriela Bucher, the executive director for the charity organization Oxfam International, said in a phone interview. “East Africa is not on the global agenda now, but the region needs the solidarity of the international community and it needs it now.”The devastating drought and the war in Ukraine are amplified by a series of crises over the past two years.ImagePeople in Baidoa, Somalia wait for water at one of the 500 camps for internally displaced people. The drought has driven many from their homes and into camps.Credit...Yasuyoshi Chiba/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe coronavirus pandemic has disrupted food supply chains and forced many families to pay higher prices for food staples. The locust infestation in Kenya, the civil war in Ethiopia, extreme flooding in South Sudan, the political crises and growing terrorist attacks in Somalia, and the intensifying ethnic conflict in Sudan have all contributed to the destruction of farms, the depletion of harvests and a worsening food crisis, aid groups say.The war in Ukraine, which is in its second month, is expected to cause further spikes in food costs across the region. The conflict, depending on how long it lasts, could reduce “the quantity and quality” of staples like wheat, said Sean Granville-Ross, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a nongovernmental organization.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 9:01 a.m. ETFires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.Shelling echoes around Kharkiv after an Easter lull.Tens of thousands are without power as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine.“Meeting the basic needs of vulnerable drought-affected populations will become more expensive and challenging,” he said.That ominous outcome is already evident in many parts of the region.In Somalia, the price of a 20-liter container of cooking oil has increased to $55 from $32, while 25 kilograms of beans now go for $28 instead of $18, according to data gathered by Mercy Corps.In Sudan, the price of bread has nearly doubled, and some bakeries have closed because wheat imports have dropped by 60 percent since the beginning of the war, according to Elsadig Elnour, the Sudan country director for the charity organization Islamic Relief.ImageEmployees package bread at a bakery in Khartoum, Sudan, last month, as food prices rise across Sudan and the region because of the conflict in Ukraine.Credit...Ashraf Shazly/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesKenya, citing the war in Ukraine, also raised the price of fuel, leading to protests in parts of the country.When famine hits, children are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 5.5 million children in the region are facing high levels of malnutrition from the drought, according to World Vision, a Christian aid organization.“My children died of hunger. They suffered,” said Ms. Ahmed, whose children, aged 3 and 4, died during her days-long trek from her home in Adde Ali village in the Lower Shabelle region to the outskirts of Mogadishu. “They died under a tree.”In Mogadishu, families are already feeling the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, with rising food prices squeezing household budgets as the holy month of Ramadan approaches. With no job, proper shelter or access to the beans, maize and tomatoes she once farmed, Ms. Ahmed now relies on food donations from well-wishers to feed her two surviving children, ages 7 and 9.And aid programs are stretched thin. The war has affected the operations of the World Food Program, which this month said it had reduced rations for refugees and others in East Africa and the Middle East because of rising costs and depleting funds.ImageBodies of giraffes in Sabuli Wildlife Conservancy in Wajir County, Kenya in December.

While the situation hasn’t reached that level yet, the funding and resources needed to avert such a crisis have not yet begun to flow, Ms. Bucher of Oxfam said.Just 3 percent of the $6 billion the U.N. needs this year for Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan has been allocated, she said, while Kenya has only secured 11 percent of the $139 million needed for assistance.Last week, the African Development Bank said it would raise up to $1 billion to improve agricultural production and help Africans become self-sufficient in food in the long run. But while these initiatives are welcome, Ms. Bucher said it was imperative that donors also give unsparingly and immediately to avert a much wider crisis.“The world needs to come to the rescue of East Africa to avert a catastrophe,” she said.ImageWorkers clean the floor as sacks of food earmarked for the Tigray and Afar regions in Ethiopia sit in piles in a warehouse of the World Food Programme in Semera, the capital of the Afar region, in Ethiopia in February.Credit...Associated PressHussein Mohamed contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/world/africa/food-crisis-africa-drought-ukraine.html

His victory was much narrower than in 2017, when the margin was 66.1 percent to 33.9 percent for Le Pen, but wider than appeared likely two weeks ago.The contest hinged on economic issues, and Macron, distracted by his fruitless Russia diplomacy, seldom showed real concern for the financial difficulties many French have faced during the pandemic and the war.But his promise of stability and his effective stewardship over the Covid-19 crisis appear to have prevailed over the strong temptation of an extremist lurch toward nationalism.Analysis: Le Pen, the leader of an anti-immigrant movement, tried to focus on economic policy in an effort to sanitize her image without softening her xenophobic program, and brought the extreme right closer to power than at any time since 1944.Russia: The election has profound effects on the war in Ukraine. Le Pen, who owes millions to a Russian bank, is a longtime Moscow ally and heads a party hostile to NATO. European officials immediately expressed their relief after Macron’s victory.ImageUkrainian soldiers paused for Orthodox Easter services on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine.

Two days earlier, the Solomon Islands said it had reached a security agreement with China, which provoked unease among Western-aligned powers in the region.Ardern and Kishida also highlighted their opposition to “unilateral actions that seek to alter the status quo by force” in the East and South China seas, most likely a reference to Beijing’s efforts to construct artificial islands for military use and encroach on disputed territories.Analysis: Tokyo has long tried to join the “Five Eyes” intelligence partnership, through which the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand share intelligence. Members were concerned about the security of the Japanese intelligence community, but the country has overhauled its methods.Background: New Zealand has itself faced questions about its reliability as an intelligence partner because it is so economically dependent on China, by far the largest purchaser of its exports.THE LATEST NEWSAsia and The PacificImageRescuers shielded a stretcher on Sunday.Credit...Jiji Press/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAt least 10 people died after a Japanese tour boat sank off the coast of Hokkaido Island.

He saw parks as sites of healing, “literal common grounds forging communities, unstratified by race or class or faith.”“The young nation that Olmsted served might be unrecognizable to him today,” Audra continues, “except for the rituals preserved and encouraged by his own creations:Restoration and recreation.Wonder and discovery.Solitude and community.And sometimes, simply — sitting still.”I highly encourage you to take a trip through Olmstead’s creations, and view more of Ruth Fremson’s stunning photos, here.PLAY, WATCH, EATWhat to CookImageCredit...Bobbi Lin for The New York TimesIce cream and a spring of tarragon round out these grape dumplings, a popular recipe among Indigenous nations of the American Southeast.What to WatchStream these five action movies, including an Indonesian fight flick interrogating toxic masculinity, a Punjabi family mob drama and a muscular South Korean gangland film.WellnessCan your diet help prevent dementia?Now Time to PlayPlay today’s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Head pests (four letters).Here are today’s Wordle and today’s Spelling Bee.You can find all our puzzles here.That’s it for today’s briefing.

184,"BRUSSELS — Russia’s faltering war against Ukraine suffered a pair of setbacks Thursday when the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet sank after a catastrophic explosion and fire, as the European Union moved closer to an embargo on Russian oil imports.Ukraine claimed to have struck the vessel, the guided missile cruiser Moskva, with two of its own Neptune missiles, while Russia said the blast was caused by ammunition aboard the ship. If confirmed, the missile attack would be a serious blow to Russia, both militarily and symbolically — proof that its ships can no longer operate with impunity, and another damaging blow to morale.It would also give a lift to Ukrainian hopes, while demonstrating the defenders’ homegrown technological capacity and exposing an embarrassing weakness in the Russian navy’s antimissile defenses.Moscow also faces the possible loss of European markets in fossil fuels, which are providing billions of dollars a month to support its war effort. The European Union has long resisted calls to reduce its energy dependency on Russia, but officials revealed on Thursday that an oil embargo is in the works and is likely to be adopted in the coming weeks.That comes on top of a previously announced ban on imports of Russian coal. Taken together, the steps are bound to raise fuel and electricity prices in Europe, potentially disrupting the economy and provoking a political backlash.Ukraine continues to brace for a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region — where Moscow has said it will focus its war efforts after its failure to capture the capital, Kyiv — while Russian forces squeeze the shrinking pocket of resistance in the ruined southern port of Mariupol. The devastation rained there has offered a dire warning of what may befall other cities in the event of a prolonged Russian siege, prompting a mass exodus of civilians from the Donbas.ImageA destroyed residential building in Mariupol on Thursday.Credit...Pavel Klimov/ReutersIts international isolation deepening, the Kremlin reacted ominously to the growing indications that Finland and Sweden would join the NATO alliance in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, the government warned that any such expansion of NATO would prompt an increased Russian military presence, including nuclear weapons, in the region.The C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, warned on Thursday of the possibility that Mr. Putin, facing a debacle in Ukraine, might use a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon, though he stressed that he had seen no “practical evidence” that such a step was pending. It was the first time he discussed publicly a concern that has been much debated in the White House.“Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” Mr. Burns said, in answering questions after a speech in Atlanta.Prominent voices in Russian state media have made increasingly incendiary statements recently, calling for more brutality in battles that have already sparked calls for war-crimes investigations of the Russian forces.Much remained unclear about Russia’s setback in the western Black Sea, where a blast on Thursday morning — Wednesday night in the United States — and subsequent fire forced many of the Moskva’s roughly 500 crew members to abandon ship. There was no word on casualties. Ukraine said it had struck the vessel with two Neptune missiles and sunk it.Russia’s Defense Ministry initially said its sailors had managed to put out the fire and the Moskva, commissioned in 1983, remained afloat. But hours later, it said, the ship sank while being towed to port in a storm.Western defense officials said they could not be sure what caused the explosion aboard the 12,000-ton ship. Three American officials briefed on the incident said all indications were that it had been hit by missiles. The officials cautioned that early battlefield reports can sometimes change, but expressed deep skepticism over the Russian account of an accidental fire.Ukraine has been stressing the need for coastal defense weapons, and the U.S. announced this week that it would send more of them. Pentagon officials said that other Russian ships had moved farther from the Ukrainian shoreline, lending credence to the claim of missile strikes.“It’s going to have an impact on their naval capabilities, certainly in the near term,” but the long-term picture is unclear, said the Pentagon spokesman, John F. Kirby, a former Navy rear admiral.Until now, Russian ships have been able to fire missiles at will against coastal cities. They have blockaded Ukraine’s south coast and threatened an amphibious landing in the southwestern region. The presence of an effective Ukrainian anti-ship weapon — Ukraine says the Neptune has a range of about 190 miles — could change those calculations, though Ukraine’s commercial shipping is unlikely to resume anytime soon.Current and former American naval commanders said a successful missile attack would represent a shocking lack of Russian combat readiness.“This is not supposed to happen to a modern warship,” said Adm. James G. Foggo III, a former commander of the United States Sixth Fleet, whose area of operations includes Europe. “If this was a Neptune missile strike, it’s indicative of complacency and lack of an effective integrated air and missile defense capability.”Ukraine has endured most of the suffering in the war that began on Feb. 24, with untold thousands of casualties, widespread destruction and millions of people displaced, but the blowback on Russia has also been severe. Moscow’s vaunted military has often seemed hapless, absorbing unexpectedly heavy losses of men and equipment, while unprecedented sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies have shaken the Russian economy.President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged some of that cost on Thursday in a videoconference with top government officials and oil and gas executives, referring to “the disruption of export logistics” in that industry and “setbacks in payments for Russian energy exports.”ImageA photo released by Russian state media showing President Vladimir V. Putin during a videoconference with government officials and oil and gas executives on Thursday.Credit...Mikhail Klimentyev/SputnikFossil fuels are Russia’s biggest export product, a huge part of the Russian economy that employs millions of people and supplies the government with much of the revenue needed to support its war-making machinery.Now E.U. officials and European diplomats say the bloc is moving toward barring oil imports from Russia, a ban that would be phased in over months to allow countries to arrange alternative supplies. They said European leaders will not make a final decision until after April 24, when France will hold its presidential runoff; a rise in fuel prices could hurt the prospects of President Emmanuel Macron and boost his right-wing opponent, Marine Le Pen, who has praised Mr. Putin.The government of Germany, the most influential country in the European Union, has been particularly reluctant to cut off Russian fuel, which would come at a steep cost and could lead to shortages. But pressure from allies and mounting evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine have, step by step, overcome that resistance. Germany refused to allow the virtually completed, $10 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to go into service, supported the coal ban and now appears to be on board with an oil embargo.ImagePart of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Lubmin, Germany.Credit...Hannibal Hanschke/ReutersThe shifting stance of the neutral Scandinavian states is another unintended consequence for Mr. Putin. In waging a war that he said was intended to keep Ukraine out of NATO — a distant prospect at best — he may have succeeded in driving two countries that had been steadfastly nonaligned for generations into the arms of the alliance.Dmitri A. Medvedev, a senior Russian security official, said on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined NATO, there would be “no more talk of a nuclear-free Baltics” region. Moscow would be compelled to “seriously strengthen” its air and ground forces in the area, said Mr. Medvedev, a former president and prime minister, and could deploy nuclear-armed warships “at arm’s length” from Finnish and Swedish shores.Vladimir Solovyov, a television host who is considered a leading voice of Kremlin propaganda, said on Wednesday that Russia should destroy all Ukrainian infrastructure, including basic utilities.Russia “must bring these terrorists to their senses in the cruelest way,” he said on his show on the state-owned Russia-1 channel. “We need to talk differently with terrorists,” he added. “There shouldn’t be any illusions that they can win.”Russia has forced independent news outlets to shut down or leave the country, and has criminalized disputing the Kremlin’s account of the war. Yet Margarita Simonyan, the head of the state-owned RT news organization, said earlier this week that the government should restrict information even more.No major power can exist “without having information under its control,” she said, adding, “we are all waiting for this.”Matina Stevis-Gridneff reported from Brussels, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

185,"WASHINGTON — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has scrambled the global foreign policy landscape. But it has also upended President Biden’s domestic agenda back home, diverting the attention of the White House and contributing to rising prices that have become a top concern of Americans just months before congressional elections.Three months after Mr. Biden vowed in a sprawling, two-hour news conference to continue fighting for college tuition, child care, early education, prescription drugs and the environment, the president’s domestic agenda has drastically shriveled.The fighting in Ukraine has disrupted global oil markets, sending gas prices and inflation in the United States soaring and — for the moment — pushing aside longer-term issues that Mr. Biden had long hoped would become the centerpiece of his legacy.Mr. Biden, who spent months in congressional negotiations last year, now spends more of his time responding to the global crisis caused by Russia. Last month, he flew to Europe for four days of emergency meetings with allies. The president is expected to attend two more European summits in May and June.Asked about the administration’s legislative goals in an interview this week, Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, said the targets for the next several months included a bill to support American innovation and the semiconductor industry, and funding requests to battle the coronavirus and continue sending weapons to Ukraine.“We’ve got a bunch of agenda items like that,” Mr. Klain said on a podcast hosted by Chuck Todd of NBC News, conceding, “The calendar has only so many months left in this year.”Mr. Klain and others in the West Wing insist the president has not given up on larger ambitions. White House officials quietly continue to talk with lawmakers about some parts of what they used to call the president’s “Build Back Better” social policy agenda, which they still hope to pass with just a bare majority in the Senate using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation.“The president also continues to work with a wide range of lawmakers,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement, “on a reconciliation plan that would cut the costs of prescription drugs, energy and child care while lowering the deficit even more and fighting inflation for the long haul, as well as a landmark bill to strengthen our competitiveness with regard to China.”But Mr. Biden — who no longer uses the phrase “Build Back Better” because members of his own party distanced themselves from it when the legislation bogged down in bickering — has done little in recent weeks to revive parts of the $2.2 trillion bill that he fought for last year.On Thursday, during a visit to a historically black college in North Carolina, Mr. Biden ended a speech with a hopeful riff in which he said politicians in the United States had come together in unison to invest in middle-class families, colleges and clean technologies.“Let’s keep building a better America because that’s who we are,” Mr. Biden said, almost pleadingly. “And we can do this.”But polling suggests the sentiment is at odds with the reality of the country Mr. Biden governs and the Washington establishment he presides over, where politics have become more divisive, the country is less unified about the right direction, and the world is distracted by Russia’s brutal attempt to take over a neighbor.ImageThe Babushkin Sad Hotel, or Granny’s Garden, was destroyed on Monday near Mriia, Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has scrambled the global foreign policy landscape for the Biden administration.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesA poll by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service on civility in America released in February found the country deeply divided, with most people concerned about the rising cost of goods. In a Monmouth University poll last month, voters used the words “divided,” “mess” and “chaos” to describe the American political system.Mr. Biden’s aides frequently lean on the cliché that they can “walk and chew gum at the same time” to suggest that the president and his team can pursue his domestic agenda while navigating the crisis in Ukraine.They point in particular to Mr. Biden’s $5.8 trillion budget, which he released at the end of March. But while he proposed an increase in domestic spending of close to 7 percent, the president’s plan puts far less emphasis on the kind of big, ambitious social programs that have stalled amid opposition from moderate Democrats and almost all Republicans.The annual budget was in some ways the clearest indication of how far the president has pulled back in the midst of the Russian invasion, rising inflation and political stalemate in Washington.It included a nod to Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, whose opposition to the social policy plan helped tank its chances at the end of last year. The budget called for reducing the nation’s budget deficit by $1 trillion over the next decade, something Mr. Manchin has repeatedly said is necessary for the country’s economic health.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.In the interview this week, Mr. Klain hinted that the administration was still trying to persuade Mr. Manchin to sign on to some version of some pieces of the broader legislation. The Democratic caucus holds 50 seats in the evenly divided Senate and can approve the legislation over unified Republican opposition only with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote, meaning that failing to convince even one Democratic lawmaker — like Mr. Manchin — prevents it from passing.“We have to come back and figure out what formula works with the 50 to get it passed in the Senate,” Mr. Klain said. “And you know, we’re not there, that’s for sure.”But even if the president makes progress on that legislation, it is not the only part of his domestic agenda that remains incomplete. As a candidate, Mr. Biden vowed to find a new bipartisan willingness in Congress to confront longstanding challenges like overhauls to the nation’s immigration system, policing and sentencing, and a new sense of equity in how the government spends money.ImageThe fighting in Ukraine has disrupted global oil markets, sending gas prices and inflation in the United States soaring.Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York TimesThe immigration bill he sent to Congress on his first day in office is going nowhere, blocked by opposition from Republicans and squabbling among his allies. Efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would have made it easier to prosecute police officers, died in Congress last year. And efforts to make good on sweeping climate change legislation have sputtered.Courts have stymied the president on some initiatives. Early last year, Mr. Biden signed economic stimulus legislation that included $4 billion for Black and other “socially disadvantaged” farmers who were discriminated against for years by banks and the federal government. But the money remains frozen because of lawsuits.In the face of those failures, Mr. Biden has said he will increase the use of executive actions that do not require congressional approval. Officials say the president is close to signing an executive order on changes to policing that was delayed by a surge in violent crime across the country. Mr. Biden has also stressed the steps he has taken to address inflation, including releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and efforts to encourage competition in industries like meatpacking.In his remarks on Thursday in North Carolina, Mr. Biden called on Congress to act quickly on the semiconductor legislation, a sprawling bipartisan effort that would invest billions of dollars with the goal of helping the United States compete against China and other countries. The House and Senate passed competing versions of the bill and must reconcile the changes before sending it to Mr. Biden’s desk.Mr. Biden said the legislation would bring down the cost of goods, noting for the audience that it would provide $90 billion for research and development, manufacturing and education in science, technology, engineering and math.“All those elements of the supply chain,” he said, “we need to produce end products right here in America.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/us/politics/biden-ukraine-domestic-agenda.html

187,"During the early days of the war in Ukraine — as Russia was attacking the city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea — Anna Sevidova decided to hide in her basement with her son. She figured it was their best hope for staying safe.But they moved back above ground after several days, thinking the threat had receded. The next day, a missile exploded in Anna’s yard, and a fragment of it shot into her house, striking her in the face. With a piece of the missile lodged in her nose, she crawled through the house, dragging her son underneath her to protect him. Both of them were covered in blood. “I thought those were the last seconds of my life,” Anna said.Instead, they survived and soon fled to Moldova, which borders Ukraine. They are among the roughly 10 million Ukrainians, or about one-fourth of the country’s population, who have left their homes in the past month. Of the 10 million, about seven million have moved to other parts of Ukraine, while more than 3.5 million have left the country.It is the largest displacement of Europeans since World War II, according to the United Nations. More than half of Ukraine’s children are no longer living in their homes.The numbers are so large because Russia is using a deliberate strategy of attacking civilians to destabilize Ukraine. This flood of refugees has created major challenges in Europe. Moldova, for example, has taken in more than 100,000 Ukrainians, despite being one of Europe’s smallest and poorest countries. About 90 percent of those refugees are living in private homes. “For now, society is showing a great degree of empathy,” Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s foreign minister, told The Times.President Biden announced yesterday that the U.S. would accept 100,000 refugees and donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge in refugees. Previously, the Biden administration had set a cap for refugees, coming from anywhere in the world, of 125,000 per year.Today’s newsletter summarizes some of the best journalism about Ukraine’s refugees, including photographs that Sarah Hughes, a Times photo editor, selected.ImageA family from Odessa, Ukraine, at a temporary shelter in Chisinau, Moldova.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York Times“One day you are driving to the dentist.

188,"Americans are worrying about their gas prices. Germans are turning down their heating. Peru has seen violent protests — and a violent crackdown on them — over rising fuel costs. Nigeria’s national energy grid recently collapsed. And that’s just this spring. Focused on the future, the United Nations Intergovernmental Planet on Climate Change warned in a report on April 4 that too much investment is going into fossil fuels and too little into the energy transition that could prevent a devastating increase in global temperatures.This persistent, simmering crisis around energy, its cost and the politics around it will not end soon.Vladimir Putin has escalated this crisis. His invasion of Ukraine has pushed up prices and forced Europe — until now the largest importer of Russian natural gas — to begin an attempt to end its longstanding dependence on Russian gas. But Mr. Putin didn’t cause this crisis alone. For nearly a year before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, supply struggled to meet demand, causing prices to surge. For the best part of a decade, the American shale boom met the world’s rising energy needs, but in 2020 shale oil output slumped and the rate of growth of shale gas fell.President Biden’s hope that he could focus his presidency on the climate, not fixing the world’s oil supply, shattered. Unable to resurrect a nuclear deal with Iran that would have restored Iranian oil to world markets, Mr. Biden began last year to ask other producers to increase their output. His pressure was to no avail. Meanwhile, China’s demand for gas imports grew by 20 percent over 2021, helping push European gas prices up nearly sixfold between March and December.That was already putting pressure on politicians, but the Putin shock — oil prices rose by one third in the first two weeks after the invasion — has exposed just how much governments fear rising fossil fuel costs, never mind their optimistic rhetoric that high prices will encourage a transition to greener energy sources. By releasing one million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve between May and November, Mr. Biden will inject the largest-ever volume of emergency American supply into the market since the stockpile was established in 1975. It will provide, at best, temporary relief. And as Asian countries start to adjust to a world in which ships bearing liquid natural gas turn away from the Pacific and redirect to Europe, their demand for coal is going up.All of this means higher energy prices for everyone, everywhere — unless economies return to the recessions they endured during the pandemic, an option no one hopes for.The parallels with the 1970s are obvious. The oil shock in the wake of the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, which involved the world’s rising oil producer, Saudi Arabia, was extremely disruptive economically and geopolitically. That first shock was followed in 1978-79 by the revolution in Iran and Iraq’s invasion of Iran, plunging the two oil producers into a long war.Then, one geopolitical era ­— with the United States as the world’s largest oil producer and Britain as (when Washington let it act) the military guarantor of Western energy interests in the Middle East — unraveled. As the Arab states seized control of production and prices from the seven big Anglo-American companies that had controlled oil in the Middle East for decades, Western economies stagnated under the inflationary pressure, supercharging protests, strikes and electoral realignments across Western democracies.What lies ahead promises to be more disorderly — and ultimately transformative — than the events of the 1970s. This is, indeed, a bigger disruption. During the geopolitical upheaval of the 1970s, the physical supply of oil from the world’s reserves was never the issue. Now, with Asian energy demand vastly higher than it was, it is. And demand for gas and coal may well also exceed worldwide output over the next few years. We appear to have entered a time when countries will have to compete for the world’s remaining accessible fossil fuels and governments openly choose geopolitical alliances to secure them.Look to the Mediterranean, for an example. Europe’s decoupling from Russia will intensify the geopolitical tensions over gas around the sea. In the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey resents its exclusion from energy projects and has been increasingly confrontational in asserting its interests. When Turkey struck a deal with Libya in November 2019 to claim new maritime economic boundaries for itself in the eastern Mediterranean, European Union leaders denounced the agreement as a violation of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty and incompatible with United Nations law. Now the route for a pipeline to bring eastern Mediterranean gas to Europe is causing tensions, not just between Turkey and its neighbors, but also within NATO.On the other side of the Mediterranean, Algeria is another potential energy source for Europe. But this, too, comes with geopolitical complications: The state-owned Algerian energy firm Sonatrach announced last month it might increase gas prices to Spain after Madrid withdrew support for Algeria in mid-March over the longstanding dispute between Algeria and Morocco over the Western Sahara.Less Russia also means more trouble in the Middle East. Without Russian help, another Iran nuclear deal becomes less likely, even as Moscow’s war amplifies all of Mr. Biden’s incentives to restore Iran’s energy exports. Rather than breaking with Russia, Arab oil producers appear to have doubled down on OPEC Plus, the world’s new oil cartel with an implicit anti-American bent. The shale boom forced Saudi Arabia to seek wider alliances, including with Russia. Now, as tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia over Syria and Yemen lessen, the Saudis will prioritize managing their competition with Russia over China — the world’s largest oil export market — and the two states’ shared interests in a nondollar payment system.It’s not just international politics that are being shaped by the sustainability of present energy consumption. Domestic politics are being shaken up, too.By damning oil companies that aren’t ramping up production, Mr. Biden has decided to privilege the voters desperate for lower immediate prices over the Democrats who insist the climate crisis should remain the priority. For the European Union, the fact that European consumers are filling Moscow’s war coffers has forced unpalatable ethical issues to the surface. As the prime minister of Italy, Mario Draghi, asked Italians: “Do you prefer peace or the air conditioning on?”But the reality is, as Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice chancellor and economic minister, acknowledged before departing for a trip to gas-rich Qatar last month, there is no “value-based” fossil fuel energy strategy for European countries other than importing all their energy from the United States, Canada or Australia, which is impossible.In Europe, an innocence about energy has been shredded and won’t readily be restored. There, the Western political taboo about talking about reducing energy consumption by means other than greater efficiency is morally exhausted. It remains to be seen whether in the United States, ghosts of President Jimmy Carter’s failed exhortations for sacrifices to personal comfort (wearing sweaters indoors, for instance) as a way to restore American energy independence will prove any less fleeting. Thanks to shale, the United States is the world’s largest oil and gas producer, rendering the country’s energy politics vastly different from that in most European countries, where foreign-energy dependency has been an uncomfortable fact of life for more than a century.What does this mean for the most existential geopolitical issue of all — climate change?Back in 2019, an energy transformation to address the climate crisis appeared on the horizon. Across the world, more new renewable power was added than ever before, and sustainability-minded investors looked to pour capital into green energy innovation. Several Group of 7 governments passed legislation to establish legally binding net-zero targets for 2050.But over 2021, as prices rose, optimism dissipated. Mr. Biden’s signature climate change bill stalled in Congress. In Britain, the Committee on Climate Change set up to advise Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government reported that the country was nowhere near hitting its transition targets because “the policy is just not there.” As much of Europe experienced low winds in 2021, it became clear that there was still much work to be done to operate electricity grids based on renewables. There were a number of factors, but the overall impact was the same.Now the momentum has changed again. For the green transition, the renewed public awareness that the supply of hydrocarbons does not take care of itself, even as Western governments promise to curtail their use, is — paradoxically — a step forward. If governments and citizens are serious about transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward greener energy, a necessary transformation that requires nothing less than changing the material basis of modern civilization, then they will have to admit that oil, gas and coal — the energy sources of the past, on which we continue to rely — can’t be taken for granted. Their extraction and use are inseparable from the difficult work of politics. That is evident today. Let’s hope we can remember it in the future.Helen Thompson (@HelenHet20) is a professor of political economy at the University of Cambridge and the author of “Disorder: Hard Times in the 21st Century.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

189,"Residential areas of Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Mykolaiv have been under near constant bombardment for days, according to local officials, the latest escalation in a southern city as Russian forces have increasingly shifted focus to the region and the east of the country.Last week, a missile blasted a hole in the side of a government building in Mykolaiv, killing dozens. On Sunday, deadly strikes injured a 15-year-old, among several others. On Monday, at least 11 people were killed and 61 wounded in attacks, the regional governor said.Shelling in the city has continued nearly every day for weeks, but civilian infrastructure and homes have increasingly been targeted, local officials and soldiers say. Russian forces have struck residential buildings, a hospital, an orphanage and schools in recent days, Oleksandr Senkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, said.The assault on the city and others in Ukraine’s south comes as Russian forces refocus after withdrawing from positions in the north and northeast. Mykolaiv is a main target because of its location along the Black Sea coast between Russian forces in the east and Odesa, the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy and the country’s largest civilian port, in the west.Russian forces have increasingly laid siege to cities they have failed to control, targeting civilians and infrastructure to demoralize populations. In the case of places like Mariupol, the besieged southern port city, they have used hunger as a weapon of war, military analysts say.Ukrainian soldiers defending Mykolaiv said most of the attacks in recent days appeared to be directed at civilian targets rather than at their positions in and around the city.“Two days ago, some bombs hit our positions, but now it’s quiet,” said Sgt. Ruslan Khoda, who is based in Mykolaiv.On Tuesday and Wednesday, air raid alarms again echoed through the early morning hours in Mykolaiv, according to Mr. Senkevych, who urged residents to take shelter immediately in a series of posts on social media.ImageA pharmacy damaged in a strike on Mykolaiv, on Tuesday.Credit...Petros Giannakouris/Associated PressThe Russian government has said it is targeting military infrastructure. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that air-based and land-based missiles had destroyed five Ukrainian fuel depots, including in Mykolaiv, which it said were being used to resupply Ukrainian forces in the area.Military analysts have said the actions in the region are part of Russia’s broader offensive. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, said in a news conference ahead of a meeting with foreign ministers on Wednesday and Thursday that in coming weeks a further Russian push is expected in eastern and southern Ukraine.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

He shared video of the attack in which a British ambulance that had been donated to the hospital was hit.

Russia’s defense ministry claimed that the damage to the ship, the Moskva, was caused by a fire and that it later sunk while being towed in a storm.Ukraine said it struck the vessel with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles, which have never been used in combat. Russia initially said that it was “seriously damaged” and that the entire crew of 700 abandoned ship. Later, the defense ministry said the Moskva had sunk in the Black Sea while being towed during a storm to the fleet’s home port of Sevastopol, the TASS news agency reported.John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that the U.S. had not yet determined what caused the fire aboard the Moskva. But some half a dozen Russian ships in the Black Sea have moved farther away from the Ukrainian coast, a senior U.S. defense official said, lending credence to Ukraine’s claim that it hit the ship with a missile.The sinking of the Moskva was a potent symbolic victory for the Ukrainian military, an embarrassment for Moscow and — if a Neptune was used — a demonstration of the power that new weapons could have in shaping the war.“This is a big deal, because it shows that the Ukrainians have some capability,” said Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. “This will be a huge boost to them and will also increase deterrence. Russian ships will be hesitant to get too close.”Ships from Russia’s Black Sea Fleet have been offshore since the start of the war, periodically launching rocket and missile attacks against targets inside Ukraine. The fleet has also cut off Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea, removing a key economic lifeline.At the start of the war, the Moskva made headlines after it called on Ukrainian troops on Snake Island to surrender and received a profane response. It also was deployed in the war in Syria, where Russian forces backed President Bashar al-Assad.Mariupol on the vergeRussian forces have moved into the center of Mariupol, the strategic southern Ukrainian city that has been under siege for more than 40 days. Analysts expect it to fall soon.ImageCredit...Russian-controlled areas represent the frontline of Russian troops.

For Western leaders traveling to meet Zelensky, the answer is complicated.The Russian defense ministry said that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines in the 36th brigade had “voluntarily put the weapons and surrendered” at the plant. Ukrainian officials conceded that some forces had laid down their weapons but they denied reports of a mass surrender.Given the recent Russian gains, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believe that Russian forces are likely to capture all or most of Mariupol in the coming week.Controlling Mariupol is crucial for Russia’s plan to create a land corridor between the Donbas region in the east and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. If Russia takes control of the city, troops fighting there could be redeployed to the Donbas, which is now Russia’s central focus in the war.Mariupol would be the second major Ukrainian city to fall to Russian forces, after Kherson, which is also in the south.Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, has estimated that tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, though officials say it has been impossible to do an accurate count of civilian casualties or to survey the full extent of the destruction. On Wednesday, the mayor said that 120,000 people were left in the city.Those who remain in Mariupol lack access to water, food or electricity, and they face almost constant bombardment. Almost no area of the city has been left unscathed, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by Masae Analytics, a company that assesses damage to buildings.What else we’re followingFrom Opinion: Ukraine is utilizing the rules of next-generation warfare, including the idea that “many and small beats large and heavy,” writes the columnist Thomas Friedman.In RussiaRussian state television is showing images of corpses in Ukraine with the word “fake” stamped on them to dismiss evidence of atrocities.President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that sanctions were disrupting Russia’s oil and gas sector.Moody’s warned that Russia’s bond payments in rubles could lead to default.Around the worldAnna Netrebko, the superstar soprano whose career crumbled because of her past support for Putin, has been invited to sing at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo.Slovakia is helping Ukraine challenge Russia in the skies with the transfer of an S-300 air defense system.The Ukraine crisis could tip more than one-fifth of humanity “into poverty, destitution and hunger,” the U.N. said.For the Ukrainians who have journeyed to the Mexico-U.S. border with their pets, many will likely have to leave them behind.We also recommendOur international correspondent Jeffrey Gettleman shares a personal story: As a Jewish reporter with Eastern European roots, one of the hardest challenges is reconciling the horrors of the Holocaust with the Poland and Ukraine of today.Thanks for reading.

191,"Good evening. This is your Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, a weeknight guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict.Russia said it had tested a new intercontinental missile. President Vladimir Putin said it was aimed at showing Russia’s adversaries that they needed to “think twice.”A Ukrainian commander said his forces and hundreds of civilians holed up at a steel plant in Mariupol had only days — perhaps hours — to live.Russian forces pressed their offensive with artillery and missile strikes along the long eastern front.More than five million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, the U.N. refugee agency said.Wimbledon will bar Russian and Belarusian players from competing in this year’s tournament.These maps show the Russian advance in the east, from several directions.Follow our live updates.ImageMatviy, 12, lying in a basement shelter decorated with a graffiti-style mural in Avdiivka, Ukraine.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesOn the front line in the eastAvdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine, has lived in the shadow of the war with Russia-backed separatists for the past eight years. Now, as Russia wages a new offensive to seize the entire eastern Donbas region, the city finds itself squarely in its sights.Artillery shelling has intensified, and this week airstrikes destroyed a supermarket and athletics store right in the middle of Avdiivka, according to local officials. Dozens of residents have been wounded in recent weeks, and each week Russian forces kill a handful of civilians.“They can’t get through the front lines, and so they’re starting simply to destroy the city,” Vitaliy Barabash, the head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told our correspondent Michael Schwirtz, who reported from there today.The city has no heat or running water, and electricity is spotty. As many as 2,000 people have moved into its 60 bomb shelters, and many more have fled, Barabash said.The Ukrainian fighters defending Avdiivka have dug into an extensive World War I-style trench system. It will be difficult to dislodge them without immense firepower.Barabash compared the escalation in the bombing of Avdiivka to the attacks on Mariupol at the outset of the invasion, nearly two months ago. Russian forces have since turned Mariupol into a charred ruin.For years, Spartak Kyurdzhiev, 16, used to continue playing computer games or doing schoolwork when artillery attacks periodically rocked his hometown. Now, the rocket fire has become so intense that he takes cover.The story of escalating warfare is similar throughout the east. Russian forces are arrayed along a front that stretches nearly 300 miles, from Kharkiv in the north to Mariupol in the south.While fighting near Kharkiv and Mariupol has been intense for weeks, Russian forces have recently begun to probe points along the middle, including the cities of Izium and Kramatorsk, where a bombing this month at a central train station killed at least 50 people.JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @nytimes channel.ImageUnpacking U.S. Javelin anti-tank missiles in Kyiv, Ukraine, in February.

But the military aid comes with a risk: antagonizing Russia and potentially igniting a wider war.Russia has warned the U.S. that deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine could bring “unpredictable consequences.”Anxiety about provoking a wider war persists among some NATO allies, most visibly in Germany, which worries that supplying Marder infantry-fighting vehicles, considered one of the world’s best armored vehicles, could be perceived by Russia as making Berlin and NATO parties to the war.Germany has already sent missiles and artillery, but Ukraine also wants heavy artillery, Leopard tanks and the Mardar.

192,"ROME — On what he described this year as an “Easter of war,” Pope Francis spoke to tens of thousands of faithful in St. Peter’s Square about the “fear and anguish” evoked by the conflict in Ukraine, adding that he hoped news of suffering in Europe would also make people more mindful of similar situations elsewhere.Francis celebrated emerging from two years of pandemic, during which he had delivered his Easter message under coronavirus restrictions, even as he acknowledged that the solidarity he had sought as a legacy of the crisis had not prevailed.But it was events in Ukraine that weighed most heavily on the annual address “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and the World”). The country had been “sorely tried by the violence and destruction of the cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged,” Francis said. At those words, applause erupted in the square. “Let there be a decision for peace. May there be an end to the flexing of muscles while people are suffering,” the pope added.Peace was possible, a duty and everyone’s primary responsibility, Francis concluded, urging people to shout that message “from our balconies and in our streets” and for world leaders to heed the call.He also alluded to the specter of potential nuclear conflict, quoting a manifesto on the dangers of new weapons of mass destruction issued by the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1955 and signed by intellectuals and scientists including Albert Einstein: “Shall we put an end to the human race, or shall mankind renounce war?”The message and blessing, given on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day, which traditionally includes pleas for peace to conflicts the world over, was delivered after the Mass on the steps of the basilica. Some 100,000 people were present in the square, overflowing into an adjacent avenue, according to the Vatican. It was a far cry from the few hundreds who attended the celebration last year.The conflict in Europe, Francis said, should make people “more concerned about other situations of conflict, suffering and sorrow.”ImageA Ukrainian flag on display as Pope Francis delivered the traditional “Urbi et Orbi” blessing on Sunday.Credit...Alessandra Tarantino/Associated PressHe cited “years of conflict and division” in the Middle East. Just days after violent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli riot police officers in Jerusalem that left 150 injured, Francis prayed that “Israelis, Palestinians and all who dwell in the Holy City, together with the pilgrims, experience the beauty of peace, dwell in fraternity and enjoy free access to the Holy Places in mutual respect for the rights of each.”Francis called for peace in Libya so it could find “stability after years of tension,” and for Yemen, “which suffers from a conflict forgotten by all, with continuous victims.” He called for an end to the “hatred and violence” in Myanmar and cited the “tragic humanitarian crisis” in Afghanistan “bringing great suffering to its people” as well as struggles in African countries.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We have seen all too much blood, all too much violence. Our hearts, too, have been filled with fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing,” he said.Francis pleaded last week for an Easter truce in Ukraine, and he has called frequently for an end to the war, which he has denounced as blasphemous and an “outrage against God.” His comments have not cited President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by name, an omission that has drawn criticism, though during a visit to Malta this month, Francis laid blame for the war on a “potentate sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests.”The pope has repeatedly called for humanitarian corridors, as well as sending envoys — two of his closest collaborators — to Ukraine to show his closeness to the Ukrainian people, and he said earlier this month that he might visit Kyiv himself.On Sunday, he said that he held the “many Ukrainian victims” in his heart, referring to “the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, the divided families, the elderly left to themselves, the lives broken and the cities razed to the ground.” The faces of the orphaned children fleeing from the war in Ukraine, he said, reflected the same pain as “those other children who suffer throughout our world: those dying of hunger or lack of medical care, those who are victims of abuse and violence, and those denied the right to be born.”The Easter message is one of peace, Francis said, adding that it was especially welcome amid circumstances like these. “Let us allow the peace of Christ to enter our lives, our homes, our countries,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/europe/pope-francis-easter-ukraine.html

194,"Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen plans on Wednesday to warn of major consequences for the global economy as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with both the conflict and global sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s aggression disrupting the flow of food and energy around the world.The comments by Ms. Yellen, who will appear before a House committee on Wednesday, come as the United States and the European Union are poised to announce another round of sanctions on Russian financial institutions, government officials and state-owned enterprises as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of abating.“Russia’s actions represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based, global order, and will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond,” Ms. Yellen will say at a Financial Services Committee hearing, according to her prepared remarks.Ms. Yellen will make clear that the United States has no intention of easing the economic pressure it is exerting on Russia through sanctions on its central bank, financial institutions and leaders. Ms. Yellen plans to emphasize that more than half of the world economy is united in the effort to impose sanctions on Russia and that the Biden administration is working to ensure that Russia does not benefit from financing available through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.“Treasury is committed to holding Russia accountable for its actions so it cannot benefit from the international financial system,” Ms. Yellen plans to tell lawmakers.Ms. Yellen also plans to underscore how the war in Ukraine is causing global food prices to surge amid disruptions to wheat exports, casting the effect as especially problematic for poor countries. She will also argue that Russia’s actions are a reminder to invest in energy independence so the world is not reliant on such nations for oil and gas.“We are witnessing the vulnerability that comes from relying on one fuel source or one trade partner, which is why it is imperative to diversify energy sources and suppliers,” Ms. Yellen will say.The economic disruption is taking place at a fragile moment, as the global economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, which has snarled supply chains and fueled inflation.Ms. Yellen plans to note that low-income countries continue to need assistance in addressing their debt burdens and to call on international financial institutions to improve vaccine distribution to developing countries.“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable to new variants,” Ms. Yellen plans to say.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/business/yellen-russia-ukraine-sanctions.html
195,"Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.ImageRussian bombardment of the region around Kyiv continued on Friday. Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.ImageCol. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, left, at a military briefing in Moscow on Friday.Credit...Natalia Kolesnikova/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on a teleconference with award-winning culture professionals in Moscow on Friday.Credit...Pool photo by Mikhail Klimentyev“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.ImagePresident Biden, who visited Poland on Friday, received a briefing with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on the country’s response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesGreeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.ImageA man ran from a shop on fire following a Russian attack in Kharkiv on Friday.Credit...Felipe Dana/Associated PressPhotographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”ImageA Ukrainian soldier near a military outpost north of Kyiv on Friday.

Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters that he had no information about when the talks, which were last held last week, would resume, and whether the events in Bucha would affect their progress.“The situation is serious, there is no doubt,” Mr. Peskov said.Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research organization close to the Russian government, said that the events in Bucha will certainly make progress even more difficult.“It is hard to sit at a table and shake hands when such things happen,” he said.While the talks are important, Mr. Kortunov said, they primarily depend on the military situation on the ground, where both sides are still waiting for more favorable conditions to emerge for them to press harder from the position of strength.“As of today, there isn’t much hope,” he said.The situation is further complicated by the fact that, while Mr. Putin alone can dictate Russian policy, in Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky is dependent on public opinion and a multitude of political actors in the country.“The events in Bucha would make him even more constrained,” Mr. Kortunov said, referring to Mr. Zelensky.Throughout the war, Russian officials have given inconsistent statements about Moscow’s aims, about Ukrainian proposals, and about the prospects for a cease-fire, a summit meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky, or an ultimate peace deal. Several times, different high-level Russian officials have contradicted each other. Some Western officials and analysts have concluded that for the Kremlin, the negotiations are purely for show.Mr. Zelensky has accepted what Russia has described as its central demand, that Ukraine not join the NATO alliance, and he and his negotiators have expressed openness to other Russian demands. Last week, they presented a set of proposals describing the outlines of a peace deal, but Russia has not formally responded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html
197,"Like many people around the world, I viewed the images that have emerged in the last few days from Bucha, Ukraine, with horror and fury. I know that all wars cause ruin and destruction, that all wars destroy and shatter innocent lives. But, although I understand this intellectually and although I saw my fair share of human suffering as a soldier in Iraq, the seemingly endless mass graves and the bound and desecrated corpses left behind in Bucha by the fleeing Russian military felt to me some new circle of hell.I looked away from the images at some point. We all have our limits. Then I couldn’t stop picturing the faces of other Ukrainians on those fallen bodies — faces of people I know in the country who are still alive.I recently returned home from Lviv, Ukraine, where I’d spent a few weeks with friends and fellow combat veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan training Ukrainian civilians in basic urban-combat and survival tactics. We flew there on our own dime and volition because we saw a sovereign democracy under assault and believe that is wrong. Lviv is 300-plus miles to the west of Bucha, but the difference between those civilians we trained and those who were massacred is just a matter of geography.During our many hours together, I got to know our trainees on a personal level: There was the idealistic law student, the gruff middle-aged geography teacher, the cheerful I.T. worker. They’re parents, neighbors, churchgoers and businessmen. Regular people with regular lives who never thought they’d be put in a situation where they might have to pick up a gun to defend themselves and their families. Yet here they were, preparing for that very possibility.The Ukrainians gave us their time and commitment. In turn, we gave them experience and hard-earned wisdom. It was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and I have no doubt that if Russian soldiers reach Lviv, these civilians will resist occupation, in various ways. If our training didn’t instill the courage and will to fight in them, Bucha certainly has.Since returning home to the United States, my fellow trainers and I have been deluged with messages from other veterans asking if they should go to Ukraine. Their motivations are many; some are natural first responders and helpers, deeply committed to the principle of service. Others long for the purpose that their previous lives in uniform provided (or the purpose they remember it providing — memory’s a hell of a thing). Some seem to be seeking something like absolution for their part in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which went amiss early on and which no amount of money or time could make clean.And a few — not many, but a few — want the opportunity to shoot a Russian invader in the face in the name of democracy. I don’t mention this flippantly. Existential fights such as Ukraine’s need such people.Should these men and women go to Ukraine? It depends. Do the would-be volunteers have a family? A life insurance policy that covers death in conflict zones? Do they have contacts already on the ground, a clear exit plan, means to fund lodging?This is a small sampling of the questions I asked myself before flying overseas with the other trainers. To me, there’s a moral clarity to helping defend Ukraine that distinguishes it from many modern conflicts. But that has little to do with the practicalities involved of actually being able to contribute. Why and how must not be conflated.Those considering traveling to Ukraine must ask themselves how they will provide something the Ukrainian people lack and need.This is what best separates those who should go, if able and willing, from those who should find other ways to support the cause. To a person, those who know they can help there have already identified areas of need. For example, a former Special Forces medic who has a month between jobs and would like to treat wounded refugees and train civilians in combat medicine. That’s someone who can make a direct, immediate difference.Then there’s the other type of potential volunteer. We called them “goons” on our way home while in Krakow, Poland, where many mill about, as it’s become a staging ground for the war across the border. Goons are easy to spot — loud and obvious, usually dressed in fatigues and sometimes adhering to extremist ideology. Some even sincerely want to help. They just don’t know where or how.Some of these people have figured their way into the war, joining Ukraine’s newly formed foreign legion and fighting Russian troops around Kyiv. There have been mixed results. “We should only take experienced combat veterans — that is the lesson that we are learning,” a Ukrainian general told Task & Purpose last month. “The others don’t know what they are getting themselves into.”This foreign legion has drawn a lot of media attention since President Volodymyr Zelensky put out the call for international recruits in late February. The Defense Ministry claims upwards of 20,000 fighters from 52 countries, with 3,000 Americans in the ranks. Harrowing anecdotes from legionnaires have emerged since, tales of not enough training and equipment, along with a pronounced absence of oversight from Ukrainian officers.“What’s different with the U.S. military and all the other NATO militaries — they’re spoiled,” an American legionnaire told Vice News. “When it comes to fighting a war, they have air support, medevac, logistics, all kinds of different levels of intelligence and support.” In Ukraine, he said, “we had none of that.”There’s also been a documented lack of trust and cohesion in the foreign legion, and Antonia Hitchens, writing in The New York Review of Books, was told that the more professional foreign fighters are finding placement in the Georgian National Legion, a separate, more established paramilitary unit fighting for Ukraine, as a result. Recruitment for the Ukrainian foreign legion has reportedly been put on hold.Whatever one’s motivation, whatever one’s purpose, the risk of simply being an American in Ukraine is tremendous. At least two U.S. citizens have been killed there — James Whitney Hill, who died during Russian artillery shelling on the city of Chernihiv, and the documentary filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot while reporting in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv. During our time in Ukraine, rumors that Americans were among the legionnaires killed in the cruise-missiles attack on the Yavoriv military base were persistent; a source in Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense whom I questioned about these claims refused to confirm or deny them. And on March 31, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, said, “Russian government security officials in both Russia and in Ukraine may be singling out U.S. citizens.”There’s little doubt an American captive, particularly a veteran, would be a propaganda coup for the Kremlin. It’s also plausible that a veteran would be treated as a combatant, regardless of his or her actual work in Ukraine. There must now be thousands of Americans in the country, working in both military and humanitarian capacities. I fear it’s a matter of when, not if, one of them falls into Russian hands and becomes the main character in a cautionary tale.There is also the not-insignificant factor of the American government to consider. The State Department has been clear: American citizens should keep away from Ukraine. Washington’s financial and “lethal aid” support seems to me the correct approach; even the Ukrainian government seems to understand why more direct intervention cannot occur.Yet there are no legal barriers to Americans going to Ukraine. In my experience, the only thing Customs officials seemed to care about when they saw Ukraine stamps in my passport was whether I was transporting weapons. (I was not.)One of the best things about being an American is we don’t need to wait around for our government to give its permission. Discouraging my fellow veterans from going to Ukraine would be both hypocritical and disingenuous. There are people there suffering, and despite America’s many recent ills and failures, our country is still viewed by many in Eastern Europe as a beacon for democratic values and ideals. That matters, I think, even in a world on fire.Morally righteous and practically sound support is what Ukrainians need from others right now. The former without the latter will only burden them. There are people who know they can help, and people who hope to.

198,"LVIV, Ukraine — Mariana Vladimirtsova was finally settled in western Ukraine after evacuating her native Kharkiv, which has been pummeled by Russian bombs since the first days of the war. Now she and her family are fleeing again because their new makeshift home in Lviv is near one of several targets struck by Russian missiles on Saturday night, upending the region’s sense of security.“We were only just starting to feel settled here,” she said as she stood with her husband, her two children and her husband’s mother on the platform at Lviv’s train station Sunday evening, about to board for Przemysl, just across the border in Poland. They were still deeply shaken by the memory of what they experienced in Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s northeast. “We were so close to the explosions there,” she said.She lamented their departure, especially the fact that she would have to leave her husband behind because martial law prevents men of military age from leaving the country. But they had decided that it was safer for the children if Ms. Vladimirtsova took them over the border.Until Saturday, the only target near Lviv that had been hit was an airplane repair factory near the city’s airport. Before that, the nearest attack had come at a military training base near Yavoriv, more than an hour’s drive away.But now the war was moving closer to their doorstep. On Sunday, Ms. Vladimirtsova and others living in Lviv woke and began surveying the damage from an overnight barrage of missile attacks on a fuel storage site and a tank repair facility. The fuel site in the city’s northeast was completely destroyed, according to Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytsky.ImageFirefighters at an oil terminal in Lviv on Sunday.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesThe new strikes have intensified fears that the city in western Ukraine may no longer be a safe haven. “It is one thing to see the war on television and it is another thing to experience it and feel that it is much closer right now,” said Yuliya Kuleba, 38, who lives near the fuel storage site. “We are worried for our kids.’’Nataliya Tatarin swept broken glass from the small shop she runs near the fuel storage facility, as firefighters lugged hoses to the site.“We heard three big explosions, and everything started to shake and fall off the shelves,” said Ms. Tatarin, 42. She ran to her nearby home, where her three children were sheltering.“There was a lot of fog and it was all just black,” she said. “My 7-year-old daughter was shaking and vomiting for most of the night,” she added, as tears welled in her eyes. The roof of the store had cracked and she was worried that it could cave in.By early Sunday, most of the fires in Lviv had been extinguished. The local authorities said the missiles had been fired from Sevastopol, a port on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.The attacks on Saturday evening came as President Biden delivered a fiery speech in Warsaw, castigating Russia for its invasion. Lviv is about 35 miles from Poland.“I think with these strikes the aggressor wants to say hello to President Biden,” Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, said on Saturday night.An independent Russian website calculated that on Saturday Russian forces had sent a record 52 missiles from the occupied Black Sea port of Sevastopol, and at least 18 from Belarusian territory. The website, The Insider, found that of the 70 rockets, at least eight landed, meaning that Ukraine had also repelled a significant amount. Those figures could not be independently verified.ImageA Russian cruise missile spotted over Lviv on Saturday.Credit...Wojtek Jargilo/EPA, via ShutterstockRussia’s Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its military had struck 67 “military objects” in Ukraine in the past 24 hours. It said that it had also destroyed a military installation in Lviv that helped upgrade and modernize missile systems, radar stations and electronic warfare equipment. Ukrainian authorities did not confirm this and it could not be independently verified.Some people in Lviv said a tank repair factory had been hit in Saturday’s strike. The uniformed men guarding the site would not provide any information on Sunday afternoon. In a small shop nearby, a man in fatigues was overheard telling a shopkeeper about how he and his comrades saw the missiles flying in the air and hid under the tanks inside the facility.Since the war began in late February, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled west to Lviv and beyond, trying to escape the worst of the fighting, which was concentrated in the east.Alyona Puzanova arrived in Lviv on March 11 after two harrowing weeks in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, the capital, where there was intense fighting with Russians.“Yesterday when they hit Lviv, the place I felt safe, I started to worry that it is going to be a new Bucha,” said Ms. Puzanova, 35, as tears streamed down her face. “I can’t believe this is happening.”Despite her fears, Ms. Puzanova said she wanted to remain in Lviv and volunteer, instead of accompanying her mother to a village a few miles away from the city center that they hope will be safer.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.“I want to help here, there is so much to do,” said Ms. Puzanova, who previously worked as a waitress and restaurant manager.Before Saturday, many people ignored air raid sirens in Lviv. They did not seek shelter, and could be seen strolling about Rynok Square, a UNESCO world heritage site and the city’s ancient heart, unflinchingly raising their coffee cups.But at the Dovzhenka Center, a former movie theater now hosting people who have been displaced, the families staying there take the sirens seriously. On Saturday, everyone piled behind the stage when the sirens blared, Julia Muzhik, a volunteer at the bomb shelter, said.ImageFamilies eating at Dovzhenka Center, a former cinema and cultural center turned into a shelter for internally displaced people in Lviv, Ukraine, on Sunday.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesVioletta Kalashnikova said after being in Kharkiv, where she left behind two apartments and her beauty salon, the sound of every plane made her flinch.But she was grateful to be far from that city, where bombs are falling indiscriminately, and which is only 30 miles from the Russian border.“In Lviv,” she said, “At least you are far enough away from where the missiles are being fired, whether it is the Black Sea or Belarus, that you have time for the system to detect the missiles and 15 or 20 minutes to hide.”Back near the fuel storage facility, Ms. Kuleba said that the soil in her yard, where she had planted vegetables, was covered in oil. She said she hoped that this would be the last missile strike and that the oil would be cleaned away soon.Ms. Tatarin, the shop owner, was inconsolable. She showed a video of her daughter, asking Russian troops not to attack children. The young girl held a heart-shaped piece of paper that she had colored in with yellow and blue, the colors of the flag of Ukraine.Ms. Tatarin said her pro-Russian mother-in-law, who lives in Crimea, from where the missiles were reportedly fired, now sees her son as a “traitor” and believes he was “brainwashed” by his wife.“We are totally alone now, my husband and I,” she said. “And each air raid siren stops my breath.”Anna Ivanova contributed reporting from Lviv.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/world/europe/lviv-ukraine-russia-missile-strikes.html
199,"BUCHA, Ukraine — The day war broke out, one of Ukraine’s most decorated pilots stepped onto the balcony of his three-story home to watch a battle raging at a nearby airport.From where he was standing, the pilot, Oleksandr Halunenko, could see the explosions and feel the shudders. The Russians were invading his country and he was worried about something close to his heart.Mriya.The plane.In a hangar a few miles away rested the world’s largest airplane, so special that only one was ever built. Its name is Mriya, pronounced Mer-EE-ah, which in Ukrainian means The Dream. With its six jet engines, twin tail fins and a wingspan nearly as long as a football field, Mriya hauled gargantuan amounts of cargo across the world, mesmerizing crowds wherever it landed. It was an airplane celebrity, aviation enthusiasts say, and widely beloved. It was also a cherished symbol of Ukraine.ImageMr. Halunenko at his home in Bucha, Ukraine. “I saw so many bombs and so much smoke,” he said. “I knew Mriya could not survive.”Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesMr. Halunenko was Mriya’s first pilot and loved it like a child. He has turned his home into a Mriya shrine — pictures and paintings and models of the aircraft hang in every room.But that morning, he had a terrible feeling.“I saw so many bombs and so much smoke,” he said. “I knew Mriya could not survive.”The war in Ukraine, not even two months old, has already destroyed so much: thousands of lives, entire families, happiness and security for countless people.But it has also destroyed material things that mean a lot — homes burned to the ground; supermarkets that fed communities smashed by shelling; toys and prized possessions scorched beyond recognition.In the case of Mriya, which took a direct hit during the pivotal battle at that airport, the damage to the aircraft has stirred an incredible outpouring of what can only be described as grief. Heartbroken airplane buffs around the world are getting Mriya tattoos. A sad cartoon has been circulating, with tears streaming out of Mriya’s eyes.But there may be no one as broken up as Mr. Halunenko, who comes from a generation where emotions are not so easily shared.“If I were not a man,” he said, “I would cry.”ImageMr. Halunenko has turned his home into a Mriya shrine. Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesMr. Halunenko, 76, was a child of the Cold War. His father was a Russian Army captain, his mother a Ukrainian peasant. Both died when he was young.At boarding school in southeastern Ukraine, he took flying lessons and discovered he had a gift. He became a MiG-21 fighter pilot and then an elite Soviet test pilot. He captained all kinds of aircraft, from sleek new fighter planes to powerful freighters but nothing as grand as what he would soon fly.In the 1980s, the Soviet leadership was eager to get back into the space race. Engineers designed a reusable spacecraft called the Buran that looked like the American space shuttle.But the components were spread all around — the shuttle was constructed in Moscow, the rockets were made hundreds of miles away and the launchpad was in Kazakhstan. The only feasible way to get everything in the same place was to fly the shuttle and the rockets on the back of a plane, a really big one.And so, at the Antonov aviation company production plant in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, Mriya was born. It made its first flight in 1988, Mr. Halunenko at the controls.At 276 feet long and six stories high, the plane, designated AN-225, was bigger than any other in the sky. It boasted 32 landing wheels and a wingspan of 290 feet. Its maximum takeoff weight stood at a staggering 1.4 million pounds, far more than a fully loaded 747. Its nose cone flipped up so that big objects, like turbine blades or even smaller jets, could be slid into its cavernous belly.ImageA replica of Mriya and the Soviet reusable spacecraft Buran.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesThere are different ways to measure size, but experts said Mriya was longer and heavier than other giant aircraft.“The AN-225 absolutely was the largest airplane ever built, of any type, for any use,” said Shea Oakley, an aviation historian in New Jersey. “People came out to see this airplane wherever it flew just to marvel at the size of the thing.”Mr. Halunenko, whose grizzly white beard makes him resemble a late-in-life Ernest Hemingway, smiled as he remembered an air show in Oklahoma more than 30 years ago.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.“It takes a lot to impress the Americans,” he said. “But I’ll never forget the crowds lined up to see us.”“And no one knew where Kyiv was,” he laughed.Mriya wasn’t easy to fly, especially with a space shuttle strapped to its back. It turned in wide arcs — Mr. Halunenko held his arms straight out like wings and rocked side to side. On the ground it was hard to dock.After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the shuttle program went down with it. Mriya was repurposed into a gigantic flying workhorse. It hauled generators, vast pieces of glass, stupendous quantities of medical supplies and even battle tanks.And the Ukrainians kept tinkering with it. In 2001, Mr. Halunenko broke more aviation records, including for the heaviest cargo load (253.8 tons) ever lifted in the air. The plane also holds the world record for transporting the longest piece of air cargo — a 138-foot turbine blade — and hosting the highest altitude art exhibition.ImageMr. Halunenko reminiscing over previous flights on Mriya with his wife, Olha, at their home in Bucha.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesBy 2004, Mr. Halunenko, who was awarded the acclaimed Hero of Ukraine medal, retired as its pilot. But Mriya carried on. In the past two years, it made hundreds of flights, often stuffed with Covid-19 supplies. For one journey to Poland, 80,000 people live-streamed the landing. With a new paint job, the yellow and blue of the Ukrainian flag, Mriya was Ukraine’s winged ambassador to the world.Its last mission came on Feb. 2, delivering Covid test kits from China to Europe before returning to its base in Hostomel, said Dmytro Antonov, one of its latest pilots.“She was in great operating shape,” he said. “We were expecting at least 15 to 25 more years out of her.”As the war neared, American intelligence officials warned Ukraine that the Russians planned to seize the Hostomel airport, not far from Kyiv. Hostomel has a long runway that the Russians wanted so that they could fly in thousands of troops.Mriya’s owners discussed moving the plane to a safer location, Mr. Antonov said, but it never happened. Company officials declined to comment on the decision, saying it was under investigation.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.At 6:30 a.m. on Feb. 24, the day the war started, Russian missiles slammed into a national guard base near Hostomel airport. A few hours later, Russian helicopters blasted the airport with more missiles that hit the hangars where Mriya and other airplanes were stored, Ukrainian soldiers said.“But we didn’t know Mriya was still here,” said Sgt. Stanislav Petriakov, a soldier at the airport. “We thought Mriya had been moved.”ImageIt is not clear how Mriya was destroyed.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesA pitched battle broke out, but the Ukrainians soon ran out of ammunition and retreated to a forest.It is not clear how Mriya was destroyed. Ukrainian soldiers said that they intentionally shelled the runway to prevent the Russians from using it. The Ukrainians said it was not their shells that hit Mriya, whose hangar is about 700 meters from the runway. When asked who he thought hit the plane, Mr. Antonov, the pilot, said, “Nobody knows.”For the next month, as the Russians occupied and brutalized Bucha, where Mr. Halunenko has lived for more than 20 years, the old pilot stood his ground. He lectured the young Russian soldiers who searched his house not to point their guns at him and at times, he defied their orders to stay inside.But he couldn’t stop thinking about Mriya.“She’s like my child,” he said. “I taught her to fly.”When the Russians finally left at the end of March, Mr. Halunenko stayed away from the airport. Until Sunday evening.That’s when he stepped past burned trucks, and with shoes crunching over pieces of metal and glass he walked across a battlefield of debris toward the plane.Slowly he approached the plane.It was a mangled fuselage with a huge hole ripped out of its middle, a nose cone sliced up by shrapnel, a wing torn open and his captain’s chair lost in a tangle of blackened metal and ash.Mr. Halunenko simply stood there, his face a blank screen.His wife, Olha, who had come to support him, whispered: “Oleksandr is a pilot. Right now he’s just processing the information. Later the emotions will hit him.”Image“We had hoped she was repairable,” Mr. Halunenko said. “But now we realize we are saying goodbye.”Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesAfter walking around the plane, he put his hand on one of the burned engines and hung his head down.“We had hoped she was repairable,” he said. “But now we realize we are saying goodbye.”All might not be lost, though. The Ukrainian government, knowing the power of Mriya’s symbolism, has vowed to rebuild her with war reparations it hopes to squeeze from Russia.Unknown to many, there is a second, half-finished Mriya fuselage. The plan, said Yuriy Husyev, the chief executive officer of Ukroboronprom, the state-owned company that runs Antonov, was to use that fuselage along with salvaged parts from the old Mriya to “build a new dream.”Mr. Halunenko is sober about this, knowing it would take “huge money” to resurrect his old friend.But sitting in his living room, surrounded by photographs of Mriya soaring through crystalline skies and parked on snowy airfields, he said, “something else is important here.” “No other country has created such an aircraft,” he said.Mriya, he added quietly, was Ukraine’s prestige.ImageMr. Halunenko with a replica of Mriya and the Soviet reusable spacecraft Buran.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesOleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/world/europe/ukraine-airplane-russia-war-mriya.html
200,"The scenes of German and Soviet soldiers overtaking Ukraine in Sergei Loznitsa’s “Babi Yar: Context” inevitably bring to mind the current Russian invasion of the country. For more than two decades, Loznitsa, a Ukrainian filmmaker who was raised in the Soviet Union, has chronicled the past and the present in Ukraine and Russia by revisiting historic events and depicting daily life in the grips of war and empire.“Babi Yar: Context,” a documentary that opens on Friday at Film Forum, recreates Ukraine during World War II through vivid archival footage of Kyiv, where Nazis murdered thousands of Jews at a single site, the ravine of the film’s title. In the fictional satire “Donbass,” which opens on April 8, Loznitsa re-enacts bizarre and disturbing episodes from Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine in the 2010s.Loznitsa, 57, recently made news when he quit the European Film Academy over a statement by the group on the Russian invasion that he deemed “toothless”; then he returned to the headlines after he was ejected from the Ukrainian Film Academy for opposing boycotts of Russian filmmakers. Even Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, weighed in during a March 27 interview with Russian journalists, saying of Loznitsa, “He’s an artist who supports Ukraine.”Loznitsa regards the conflict as “a European war, not just a Ukrainian war.” Speaking in Russian, with his producing partner Maria Choustova-Baker serving as an interpreter, he spoke about his films and current events during a video chat from Berlin, where he lives. These are excerpts from our conversation.Where were you when the Russian invasion started?Vilnius. I am finishing a new film there. I was awoken by an SMS from my friend, Russian filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky. It said, “Forgive me. What a nightmare.”Is it true that you helped your parents get out of Ukraine?In contrast to many others, I actually believed in what the U.S. intelligence was reporting and what President Biden was telling the world [that Russia had planned to invade]. I even guessed the dates correctly. My friend, the Ukrainian co-producer Serge Lavrenyuk, helped me remove my parents [from Kyiv, three days before the invasion started]. This war comes as an enormous shock for millions of people. My father was born in 1939, and he remembers very well his childhood and these horrors. My mother was born in 1940 and also remembers all the movement during the war. Now they are [in their 80s] and it is the same circumstances!ImageA scene from “Babi Yar: Context,” his documentary about Kyiv in World War II.Credit...via Film ForumHow would you compare the situation now with the history in “Babi Yar: Context”?The fundamental difference is that back then, it was a fight between two totalitarian regimes. Now there is one totalitarian regime fighting with a country aspiring to be independent. Back then, the big countries like the U.S. and the U.K. also participated in the war. But today, the majority of the countries who have the potential to stop this war have chosen this immoral position of an onlooker, of noninterference. And the politicians of these countries have put their citizens in this situation of immorality, because the only choice the citizens have is to observe online, in real time, how city after city of Ukraine is destroyed.You could say that Putin is winning at the moment internationally, because the policies of world leaders are based on fear. They’re not even capable of taking a rather neutral step of introducing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.Some worry that such involvement would lead to escalation and nuclear conflict.I don’t think it’s a valid excuse. First of all, do these politicians have any guarantee that in case — God forbid — Russia does manage to swallow Ukraine, they won’t use nuclear weapons? Putin had no valid reason for invading Ukraine. So why do you think he would need a valid reason to use nuclear weapons? This can only be stopped by force. Sooner or later, NATO will have to get involved, and the longer they wait, the bloodier the resolution of the conflict would be.“Babi Yar: Context” doesn’t shy from addressing the role of people within Ukraine in the massacre of Jews. Have you experienced any criticism about this?There were people who criticized me in Ukraine for making this film the way I made it. The contemporary situation is completely different. And it’s absolutely obvious that all that Putin is talking about, that there are Nazis in Ukraine, was all nonsense. At the same time this question of collaboration in history is very, very painful in Ukraine. Yes, I was heavily criticized.Do you have relatives that were affected by the Babi Yar killings?[Nods]In “Donbass” you take a different approach: dramatizing events based on actual cellphone videos. Why this form?First, because I was mesmerized by those amateur videos that I found on the internet. Second, I wanted to create this grotesque form because I needed something to keep the film together and I didn’t want to use just one protagonist or a group of protagonists. I wanted you to observe the idiocy in all its shapes and forms. This wonderful film by Luis Buñuel, “The Phantom of Liberty,” also employs this method.Image“Donbass” is an antiwar satire.Credit...Arthouse TrafficOne of the scenes shows Russians moving artillery around from place to place after firing on a civilian bus.Yes, the most important thing for them was not to be identified. So this is why they had to move from one place to the other. And the killing that occurs afterward [in the film] is because they wanted to get rid of the witnesses.That sounds like a mafia movie.Yes, in fact, these criminal gangs that took power in 1917 and that hold power today, there’s no difference between them and any other mafia. Before this, the mafia covered itself up with Soviet ideology. Nowadays there is no ideology anymore. It’s just mafia.“Donbass” also portrays people who are hired to pretend to be witnesses to a staged explosion.Yes, it happens all the time. This is the technique that’s routinely employed by Russian television, and monitoring groups managed to identify actors who play the parts of witnesses in different locations. So they have almost a cast of actors that they employ for fabrication of fake news. There was a notorious TV report around 2014: a story of how Ukrainians crucify a Russian boy. This report was analyzed by professionals who proved that every single element was fake, all staged.When you were growing up in the Soviet Union, was there a point where you became disillusioned?The fact is that the entire Soviet Union lived in this kind of double reality or multiple realities, and everybody was aware of it, but very few people actually questioned it. But I was a very bad pupil. [Laughs] I was a very good pupil in terms of school results, but I always questioned this double reality and asked myself, “Where am I and what is going on?”Today this criminal group [in power in Russia] has regrouped. They fixed the country’s economy a little bit. They upgraded their military force. And now they’re ready to conquer the world again. [Laughs]These days your movies can look like prophecies because of their familiar images of war.The problems that I talk about in my films have been around for a long time. This is why I wanted to make “Mr. Landsbergis” [a new film about Lithuania’s successful bid for independence from the Soviet Union in 1989-91]. Because there is this unique and fantastic and colossal experience of fighting against the Soviet Union and winning.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/movies/sergei-loznitsa-russia-ukraine.html

202,"The apocalyptic images of bodies sprawled in the mud among twisted tanks, charred walls and splintered trees in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities speak to the brutality of the war that Vladimir Putin started. The knowledge that more such horrors, many more, will be revealed as Russian troops retreat cries out for a reckoning.President Biden called for a war crime trial, and President Emmanuel Macron of France declared there were “clear” indications of war crimes. Human Rights Watch reported documented cases of rape and summary executions. Ukrainian and international investigators have already begun collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses. It is imperative that this work be done promptly and scrupulously.It may appear unduly legalistic to parse evidence or to question witnesses as countless civilians cower in their homes hoping against hope that Russian shells don’t hit their apartment buildings. The very notion that warfare can have rules, suggesting that there are correct ways to inflict death and destruction on an enemy, is difficult to grasp, and prosecuting commanders carries the risk of appearing as victor’s justice.For at least 75 years, the international community has undertaken a real but incomplete effort to define wars of unprovoked aggression as crimes in and of themselves. In the words of the Nuremberg tribunal, “To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.”In Ukraine, there is no question that Russia is the aggressor, that Bucha, the Ukrainian town that had been occupied by Russian forces for five weeks — and Mariupol and Kharkiv and Chernihiv and Kyiv and scores of other cities and towns — would be peacefully greeting spring had Mr. Putin not ordered an unprovoked war to satisfy his ambitions of empire and the destruction of a neighboring nation. Ukraine’s resistance is unquestionably self-defense, and the nations of the world are within their rights to impose sanctions on Mr. Putin and his country. Concerned nations are also right to help arm the Ukrainian military, if only to make the price of aggression so high that he, or at least those around him, might come to their senses.Yet the world has also identified crimes that are unacceptable even in the fog of battle. Objectively gathering and documenting evidence is a powerful way to cut through the muck and preserve the possibility that someone might someday be held accountable. It holds out the possibility, however slim, that someday a judge will declare the orders to fire on a village or hospital illegal and that that legal judgment might one day serve as a deterrent in the next war. War crime investigations are a powerful political tool that can be used to underscore the dignity of victims and the lawlessness of the invaders.An array of international criminal laws emerged after World War II, most famously the Geneva Convention of 1949, which aims to hold combatants personally responsible for war crimes — such as intentionally slaughtering civilians, torture, wanton destruction of property, sexual violence, pillaging, conscripting children. Other measures included the Genocide Convention and laws prohibiting crimes against humanity.The Russian Army’s actions give every appearance of violating these rules, and investigations have already begun in the International Criminal Court and some other courts. The indiscriminate shelling of cities and towns, the killings evidenced by the mass graves discovered in Bucha and the bombing of a Mariupol theater are among the many actions that could be deemed war crimes. The entire invasion would appear to be a crime of aggression, which would presumably reach Mr. Putin. If these crimes are determined to be part of a widespread or systematic attack on the civilian population based on a state policy, they could also amount to crimes against humanity.Russia, for the record, says the atrocities in Bucha are all staged. And it may well be that investigators will find evidence of atrocities committed by Ukrainian troops against Russians or collaborators. All the more reason to conduct a thorough accounting.Delivering justice — collecting the evidence, securing an indictment, holding a fair trial — is hard, time-consuming and expensive. As such, few instances of war crimes lead to punishment. Though the I.C.C. can initiate prosecution on any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime on its own, a charge of the crime of aggression — the one most applicable to Mr. Putin and his lieutenants — would have to be initiated by the United Nations Security Council, where it would face a certain Russian veto. In addition, Russia does not recognize the I.C.C. and would not surrender suspects.Ukraine also is not party to the treaty that established the court but has allowed it jurisdiction over crimes committed on Ukrainian soil. The United States, for its part, has its own history of hostility to the I.C.C., and when accusing Mr. Putin of war crimes, Mr. Biden did not make clear what forum should be responsible for prosecution.Yet none of these hurdles should preclude a search for justice. Even if the process is difficult and stretches into months and years, it is important that history be left a forensic, credible, verified and judicially processed record of the specific crimes in Ukraine. Those responsible should be named, their actions specified, and if at all possible, the guilty should be locked away. The very fact that Russia is arguing that the atrocities were all concocted requires a detailed and incontrovertible judicial response.The Biden administration and its allies have done an admirable job of puncturing the Kremlin’s propaganda with accurate intelligence. An authoritative record of war crimes would serve the same purpose for the future.It would be good for the Biden administration to find a way to cooperate with the I.C.C. in collecting evidence, even if it is precluded by law from helping to finance the effort. There are other options: A special tribunal could be established without a U.N. endorsement, and several nations, including the United States, could claim universal jurisdiction and hold their own trials. But too many investigations would dilute the public impact of the legal process, and no tribunal carries the authority or mandate of the I.C.C.However it is done, seeking justice against Mr. Putin and others responsible for war crimes in Ukraine is a goal for the longer term. Russia is not retreating. It is repositioning its forces for an assault in the east. And Russia’s participation in sputtering peace talks is looking increasingly like a ploy. The horrors of Bucha have prompted talk of offering Ukraine deadlier weapons and imposing yet more sanctions. These must be the focus of the West’s efforts to help Ukraine.But it is also imperative to make sure that the horrific evidence of criminal atrocities on display in Bucha and so many other places is promptly collected while it is still there and that witnesses are questioned while their memories are still raw. Posterity must know what really happened. Justice must be given a chance.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

203,"An embargo on Russian natural gas could cause Germany’s economic output to drop as much as 5 percent this year, the Bundesbank warned on Friday, potentially driving the country into a recession while pushing up already high consumer prices.The central bank’s predictions, largely in line with those of several economic institutes, also served as a warning of the danger that Europe’s largest economy could face if Russia decides to cut off gas exports to Europe.The central bank said its predictions were couched in uncertainty, given the unpredictable nature of the crisis surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But its economic modeling showed that cutting off Russian natural gas, which before the war accounted for 55 percent of Germany’s supplies, would cause gross domestic product for the year to shrink 2 percent instead of growing by 3 percent.“Natural gas prices are likely to rise the most, as Russian deliveries are difficult to replace in the short term,” the bank said. Roughly a third of all natural gas is used for industrial production, including steel and chemicals.This week, the International Monetary Fund warned that the war in Ukraine would drag down the eurozone economy. It downgraded its forecast of economic growth to 2.8 percent from the 3.9 percent it had predicted in January.Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen also warned that a ban on Russian gas could have a “counterintuitive” effect and harm Europe’s economy more than Russia’s by driving up the global price of fuel.“Europe clearly needs to reduce its dependence on Russia with respect to energy,” Ms. Yellen told reporters in Washington on Thursday. “But we need to be careful when we think about a complete European ban.”The European Union has banned Russian coal and is preparing a plan to embargo Russian oil. Although Germany has said it is working to end imports of Russian oil this year, it has been reluctant to move more quickly. Last year, Germany imported about a third of its crude oil from Russia.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/business/germany-economy-russian-gas.html
204,"With a pointed warning to Ukraine’s Western allies, Russia test-launched a new intercontinental missile on Wednesday, even as it unleashed a hail of bombs, artillery and missiles inside Ukraine in a drive to weaken Ukrainian defenses for a major ground offensive in the east.The intensifying barrage, aimed at more than 1,100 targets, came as the Russian military made probing attacks along a 300-mile front line winding through Ukraine’s southeastern Donbas region, which the Kremlin has said will be the focus of the next phase of its war, and continued to build up and prepare a massive force there.The new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile “will force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice,” President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said in televised remarks, a clear reference to the United States and other nations that have aided Ukraine in the face of Russia’s eight-week-old invasion.It is not yet clear if the missile, which Russia’s Defense Ministry said could carry multiple nuclear warheads and outwit defenses anywhere in the world, actually possesses game-changing capabilities. The ministry also acknowledged the missile is not yet ready for active deployment, and the United States said it had not been surprised by the launch.But the test-firing and Mr. Putin’s comments fit neatly into a relentless Kremlin propaganda campaign — the only information many of his people ever see — presenting Russians not as aggressors but as victims of Western persecution, yet still powerful and unbowed.In a televised appearance with a group of school children at the Kremlin, Mr. Putin repeated his lie that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian speakers in Donbas, which had “forced, simply compelled Russia to start this military operation.”ImageAn image taken from video released by the Russian military on Wednesday showing the launch of a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile during a test at Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia.Credit...Russian Defense MinistryThe rising death and destruction in Donbas, along with a critical scarcity of basic supplies and services, have been driving an exodus of staggering proportions in Ukraine, a country with a prewar population estimated at 43 million. The United Nations said the number of people who have left the country reached 5 million, in addition to more than 7 million who have fled or been forced from their homes but remain within Ukraine.Russia rejected calls by the United Nations and others for a humanitarian cease-fire to allow civilians to evacuate safely and supplies to reach those who remain. At a U.N. Security Council meeting on Tuesday night, the Russian deputy ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said such pleas were “insincere, and in practice they merely point to an aspiration to provide Kyiv nationalists breathing room to regroup and receive more drones, more antitank missiles” and antiaircraft missiles.ImageA priest conducting funeral services for two Ukrainians in Hostomel, Ukraine, including one who had been held captive by Russian occupation forces. Credit...Alexey Furman/Getty ImagesIn Finland, lawmakers began debating whether to join NATO — the latest example of the war backfiring against Russia’s goals. Mr. Putin sought to prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance, eliminate the country’s military and political independence, and sow divisions within NATO.Instead, Finland and Sweden are edging toward abandoning their longstanding nonalignment, seeking NATO’s protection from an aggressive Russia. NATO is ramping up military spending and is more united than it has been in years, and Ukraine’s military has put up a surprisingly tough fight against the larger but often disorganized and demoralized invading force.The Ukraine invasion also has left Russia ostracized financially and economically — punctuated Wednesday at a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting. Several participants, including Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, abruptly left in protest when Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, started to speak. The United States and other NATO countries have funneled enormous quantities of arms to Ukraine, and increasingly those shipments include heavier, more sophisticated and longer-range weapons — large-caliber artillery, armored vehicles, antiaircraft missiles and spare parts for damaged aircraft — drawing ominous warnings from the Kremlin.Even Germany has reversed a long-held prohibition on sending arms to a conflict zone and has beefed up its own military spending, but calls to go farther still and ship tanks to Ukraine have divided the government in Berlin.Russia has falsely insisted since the invasion began on Feb. 24 that it was striking only military targets, but countless shattered, burned-out and flattened apartment blocks, stores, offices, houses and cars attest otherwise. In the Donbas town of Avdiivka, near the front lines, where Russian bombardment has caused a number of civilian deaths and injuries, and driven many of those who remain underground, just this week airstrikes destroyed a supermarket and an athletics store in the heart of town.The extended shelling and bombing before sending large ground forces into battle reflect a change in Russian strategy from the early part of the war, when it tried and failed to seize major cities and other locations quickly.A Russian ground offensive backed by air, land and sea bombardment continues to lay waste to the southeastern port of Mariupol, now a scene of destruction and casualties on a scale all but unknown in Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials said 20,000 people there had been killed — a figure impossible to verify, with access to the world cut off and many bodies still uncollected — and about 120,000 of the city’s prewar population of more than 430,000 remain trapped in the ruins, with little access to food, water, power or heat.ImageUnexploded ordnance littering a field on Wednesday in Ivanivka village in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine.Credit...Oleg Petrasyuk/EPA, via ShutterstockUkrainian officials said early on Wednesday that they had reached an agreement with Russian forces to allow children, women and the elderly to safely leave Mariupol, only to say later that the evacuation deal had fallen apart, like so many before it. “Due to the lack of control over their own military at the place, the occupiers were unable to ensure a proper cease-fire,” said Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister.Soldiers and civilians were holding out in a warren of underground bunkers beneath the sprawling Azovstal steel mill complex in the city, defying ultimatums to surrender, while Russian fire concentrated on that site.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We are probably facing our last days, if not hours,” Serhiy Volyna, a commander from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, said in a video on Facebook from the plant. “We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us.”He and other Ukrainians said that Russian forces had bombed a hospital at the Azovstal complex. “We are pulling people from the rubble,” Sviatoslav Palamar, another commander inside the steel mill, told Radio Liberty.Azovstal employees say about 4,000 people took refuge beneath the mill early in the war, mostly plant workers and their family members, but many later left. Other civilians sought shelter inside the plant, fleeing the Russian advance and, according to Ukrainian officials, fearing capture and forced relocation to detention camps in Russia. For soldiers, Azovstal is the last redoubt in the city.It is not clear how many people remain there. Mr. Volyna said that 500 of them were injured.ImageSmoke from the besieged Azovstal steel mill complex in Mariupol on Wednesday.

Earlier in the war, Mr. Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on a higher state of alert, and a top Russian official has spoken of placing nuclear weapons along the borders of the Baltic States.American officials said those earlier steps had no apparent action behind their heated rhetoric, and required no response from the United States. They reacted similarly on Wednesday. The Pentagon and the White House both said Moscow had properly notified Washington in advance of the Sarmat test.“Such testing is routine,” said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. “It was not a surprise.”Like many I.C.B.M.s operated by Russia, the United States and other nuclear powers, the Sarmat is made to carry multiple nuclear warheads, each aimed at a different target, delivered by “independent re-entry vehicles” that the missile releases high above the atmosphere, along with decoys, to evade missile defense systems.ImageA photo released by Russian state media shows President Vladimir V. Putin watching the I.C.B.M. test on Wednesday.Credit...Mikhail Klimentyev/SputnikIn addition, Russian officials have said that those re-entry vehicles could be “hypersonic glide vehicles,” able to maneuver en route to their targets, making them even harder to stop. The Sarmat was one of the next generation of weapons Mr. Putin announced in 2018, describing them as impossible to defend against, but Western analysts have questioned whether the glide vehicles and other new technology exists yet, or will any time soon.The missile, launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia, struck a target on the Kamchatka Peninsula, 3,500 miles to the east, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

205,"BERLIN — Chancellor Olaf Scholz surprised the world, and his own country, when he responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a 100-billion-euro plan to arm Germany, send weapons to Ukraine and end his nation’s deep dependence on Russian energy.It was Germany’s biggest foreign policy shift since the Cold War, what Mr. Scholz called a “Zeitenwende” — an epochal change — that won applause for his leadership at home and abroad.But six weeks later, the applause has largely ceased. Even as images of atrocities emerge from Ukraine since the invasion by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Scholz has ruled out an immediate oil and gas embargo, saying it would be too costly. He is dragging his feet on sending 100 armored vehicles to Ukraine, saying that Germany must not “rush ahead.” There are new debates in the ruling coalition about just how to go forward with the massive task Mr. Scholz has laid out, let alone how fast.Already doubts are building as to the German government’s commitment to its own radical plans. “Zeitenwende is real, but the country is the same,” said Thomas Bagger, a senior German diplomat who will be the next ambassador to Poland. “Not everyone likes it.”The changes Mr. Scholz announced go far deeper than his commitment to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on the military — some €70 billion ($76 billion) a year, compared with France’s €41 billion ($44 billion).They go to the heart of Germany’s postwar identity as a peaceful exporting nation — and to the heart of a business model that has enriched Germany and made it Europe’s largest and most powerful economy.Now Germans are being asked “to rethink everything — our approach to doing business, to energy policy, to defense and to Russia,” said Claudia Major, a defense expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “We need a mind-set change. We need to recognize that this is about us — that power politics are back and Germany must play a role.”But she added, “Once again Germany is not leading, it is being dragged.”Truly reorienting Germans for a new world where security has its real costs — not only in terms potentially of lost lives, but also in lost trade, higher energy prices, slimmer profits and lower economic growth — will be a wrenching endeavor that will take time, even a generation, and more than an afternoon’s policy pronouncement.ImageGerman soldiers at a NATO military training center in Rukla, Lithuania, last month.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesThat realization is dawning, for Germans and their frustrated European partners.“I don’t understand how anyone in Germany can sleep at night after seeing horrors like this without doing anything about it,” said Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s outspoken ambassador in Berlin, referring to the atrocities in Ukraine. “What does it take for Germany to act?”Even Annalena Baerbock, the self-assured Green foreign minister, expressed concerns that Zeitenwende may be more temporary than fundamental. She said she worried that the consensus was fragile, that Germans who favor close ties to Russia were silent now, but had not changed their views.“You can feel this,” she said in an interview. “They know they have to do it right now with regard to sanctions, energy independence and weapons deliveries, also with regard to how we treat Russia. But actually, they don’t like it.”Since Mr. Scholz put forth his Zeitenwende before a special session of the Parliament on Feb. 27, multiple cracks in Germany’s commitment to change have already begun to appear.German celebrities made headlines with an appeal to the government against rearmament and the “180-degree change in German foreign policy” that has so far been signed by 45,000 people. Green lawmakers have lobbied to spend only part of the €100 billion special fund on the military, citing other needs like “human security” and climate change. Labor unions and industry bosses are warning of catastrophic damage to the economy and an immediate recession if Russian gas stops flowing.As the chief executive of the German chemicals giant BASF, Martin Brudermüller, put it last week: “Cheap Russian energy has been the basis of our industry’s competitiveness.”It has in fact been the basis of the German economy. Now that German businesses are facing the possibility of being asked to do without it, resistance is quietly mounting. Government ministers say they are being asked discreetly by business leaders when things will “go back to normal” — that is, when they can return to business as usual.Ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, business as usual has largely meant “change through trade” — the conviction that economic interdependency would alter authoritarian governments like Russia and China for the better and help keep the peace. Prosperity and democracy, the thinking went, go hand in hand.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.The link to Russia is particularly complicated by a long and complex history of hot and cold war, including guilt over the millions of Russians killed by the Nazis. This reinforced the belief that the security architecture of Europe had to include Russia and take account of Russian interests.ImageA ""die-in"" during a protest in front of the Bundestag in April calling for an immediate Russian energy embargo.Credit...John Macdougall/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIt was a model that paid off nicely for Germany, too.“We export to China and import cheap gas from Russia, that’s been the recipe for the German export success,” said Ralph Bollmann, a biographer of Angela Merkel, the former German chancellor who is now seen as having protected Germans from a rivalrous world, but not preparing them for it.Few in Germany, including its intelligence services, predicted that Mr. Putin would invade a sovereign European country. But the war has set off a cycle of soul-searching, even among prominent politicians like Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the former foreign minister and now federal president.A senior member of Mr. Scholz’s Social Democratic Party, he was a prominent supporter of the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline, now halted, that bypassed Ukraine and that Washington opposed.“We were clinging to the idea of building bridges to Russia that our partners warned us about,” Mr. Steinmeier said, after Mr. Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador, accused him of enabling Mr. Putin. “We failed to build a common Europe,” Mr. Steinmeier said. “We failed to incorporate Russia in our security architecture.” He added: “I was wrong.”In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Scholz’s Zeitenwende speech, the details of which he had shared with only a handful of people, the resolve to act decisively seemed palpable.The three diverse parties in his coalition swung behind it and partisan divisions with the conservative opposition were briefly forgotten, too. Public opinion mirrored the shift, rewarding the new chancellor with better popularity ratings.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

But he noted that with this war, “There can be no return to business as usual,” adding, “No one really wants to go back to the old times of engagement with Russia.”Still, he said, “We shouldn’t overdo it. The balance will shift to more deterrence and less dialogue. But we must keep some dialogue.”Ms. Puglierin has little patience for such arguments. “People need to let these old ideas go and adapt to reality as it is, and not as they want it to be,” she said. “Russia has shown that it does not want a stable relationship on this existing security order, which is now an empty shell.”A prominent conservative lawmaker, Norbert Röttgen, argued that Germany must make a complete and immediate break with Russia. “War has come back to Europe, one that will affect the political and security order of the continent,” he said.Germany must also draw on the lessons of its dependency on Russia for its future relationship with the more powerful authoritarian realm of China, on which key sectors of Germany’s export-driven model rely, Mr. Röttgen said.“The real Zeitenwende,” said Ms. Puglierin, “will come when we remake our model for a future of competition with both Russia and China and realize that every dependency can be used against us.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/europe/germany-russia-ukraine-war.html
206,"The images of dead Ukrainians, some with their hands tied and others haphazardly buried in pits, spurred shocked Western leaders on Monday to promise even tougher sanctions against Russia, including possibly on energy, as the Kremlin dug in and showed signs of preparing a new assault.The growing evidence that Russian soldiers killed scores of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, leaving their bodies behind as they withdrew, prompted President Biden to call for President Vladimir V. Putin to face a “war crime trial.” Germany and France expelled a total of 75 Russian diplomats, and President Emmanuel Macron of France said the European Union should consider sanctions against Russian coal and oil.“This guy is brutal,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Putin. “And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it.”ImagePresident Biden in Washington on Monday.Credit...Tom Brenner for The New York TimesIn Moscow on Monday, Mr. Putin said nothing about his war in Ukraine, but his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the Kremlin “categorically” denied “any allegations” of Russian involvement in the atrocities. Instead, Russia’s state media aired relentless conspiracy theories about what it said was a Ukrainian fabrication, while the authorities threatened to prosecute anyone who publicly blamed Russians for the Bucha killings.Russia said the bodies had been placed only recently on the streets after “all Russian units withdrew completely from Bucha” around March 30. But a review of videos and satellite imagery by The New York Times shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town.The war in Ukraine may now be headed for an even more dangerous phase, despite Russia’s withdrawal last week from areas near Kyiv.Ukrainian and Western officials said that Russia appeared to be positioning troops for an intensified assault in the eastern Donbas area, where the port city of Mariupol remains under a brutal siege. And in Kharkiv, roughly 30 miles from the Russian border, unrelenting bombardment has left parts of the city of 1.4 million unrecognizable.The systematic destruction produces little military gain, but is part of a broader strategy to seize the country’s east, analysts and U.S. military officials say.With the Russian economy showing some signs of resilience after the initial shock of the wide-ranging Western sanctions put in place after Mr. Putin’s invasion in February, the Kremlin appeared to be girding for a continuation of the war, despite talk in European capitals of now possibly banning Russian coal, oil or, less likely, gas.“They are not going to stop,” Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said in a statement on Monday. “Putin’s order given to his soldiers to destroy our state has not disappeared.”In a visit to Bucha on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine left the door open to a negotiated peace, despite the horrific scenes uncovered over the weekend. In a camouflage bulletproof vest, surrounded by soldiers and journalists, Mr. Zelensky accused Russia of “genocide,” but said he was still hoping to meet with Mr. Putin to try to stop the war.“Ukraine must have peace,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We are in Europe in the 21st century. We will continue efforts diplomatically and militarily.”Mr. Biden, speaking to reporters in Washington after returning from Delaware, said that “information” needed to be gathered for a trial of Mr. Putin, calling the Russian leader a “war criminal.” Mr. Biden said he would at some point be announcing more sanctions against Russia, without specifying what they would be.In Europe, the growing evidence of Russian atrocities also appeared to be paving the way for more sanctions, even as divisions remained among E.U. members of whether to impose a broad ban on Russian energy imports.“Today there are very clear signs of war crimes,” Mr. Macron, the French president, told France Inter radio. “Those who were responsible for those crimes will have to answer for them.”ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France during an interview on Monday.Credit...Ludovic Marin/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEuropean Union ambassadors will meet on Wednesday to discuss another package of sanctions against Russia, but the extent of the new measures is still very much in flux, diplomats and officials said. A meeting of NATO defense ministers is also scheduled to take place that day.Since the start of the conflict, European leaders, along with the United States, have pursued a strategy of putting sanctions in place a piece at a time, gradually toughening them to leave themselves more cards to play in case Russia escalates the conflict.But the outrage over the new revelations of atrocities may force their hand.One version of a new E.U. sanctions package under consideration could include a ban on Russian coal, but not oil and gas, E.U. officials said. Bans on Russian goods entering E.U. ports are also under consideration, as well as smaller measures to close loopholes in existing sanctions, European diplomats and officials said.While Mr. Macron said the new sanctions should target both coal and oil, Christian Lindner, the German finance minister, indicated that coal would be the only Russian energy export included in the sanctions package. The European Union, he said, needed to “differentiate between oil, coal and gas.”Coal, which is largely mined by private companies in Russia, is less critical to the Kremlin’s coffers than the oil and gas industry, in which state-owned companies play the leading role.Germany is the key country holding the bloc back from an outright ban on oil and gas, though the idea is also unpopular in other, smaller European nations that largely rely on Russian supplies. Berlin has consistently argued that sanctions against Russia ought to hurt Russia more than they hurt Europe.ImageA compressor station of the Jagal natural gas pipeline near Mallnow, Germany.

The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Christine Lambrecht, the defense minister, said the bloc should consider banning gas imports, while the economy and energy minister, Robert Habeck said such a move would not be useful because Mr. Putin has “already practically lost the war.”“The horrifying news from Bucha will certainly pile more pressure on the E.U. to impose energy sanctions on Moscow this Wednesday, but hard-hitting import bans on oil and gas remain unlikely for now,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.“Internal momentum is building over stopping Russian coal,” Mr. Rahman said, “If anything, that’s likely to be the first thing Brussels targets on the energy side.”Mr. Rahman said that, for now, the economic and political costs of a sudden stop of Russian oil and gas imports were too high for most E.U. leaders. He said it could take Russia using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine to lead the E.U. to impose sanctions on oil and gas imports.Still, the Bucha revelations did prompt Germany and France — two countries that have long been careful to avoid provoking Russia — to escalate the confrontation with Moscow.Germany said it would expel 40 Russian diplomats, an unusually high number for a single round of expulsions that Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said was necessitated by the “incredible brutality on the part of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda.”France said it, too, would expel “many” Russian diplomats stationed in the country; a Foreign Ministry official put the number at 35.And Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and recalled its own from Moscow, the first time that a European country has made such a move since the start of the war.Russia promised to retaliate against the expulsions and dismissed the reports of the atrocities in Bucha, describing them as fabricated pretexts for more sanctions. State television even claimed that Western operatives had chosen Bucha for their “provocation” because the town’s name sounded like the English word “butcher.”ImageThe body of a civilian near Bucha on Sunday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesIt was the latest instance in which the Kremlin’s media machine has tried to parry overwhelming evidence of Russian involvement in an atrocity with a flood of conspiracy theories sowing confusion among casual consumers of the news.It appeared likely that, inside Russia, the approach would work. The Kremlin narrative is increasingly the only one being heard by regular Russians, with independent news media shut down, access to Facebook and Instagram blocked, and a new censorship law punishing any deviation from that narrative with as much as 15 years in prison.Driving the point home, the Russian general prosecutor’s office issued a statement on Monday indicating that anyone referring to the Bucha atrocities as Russia’s doing risked prosecution.Anton Troianovski reported from Istanbul, and Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels.

207,"His “Prayer for Ukraine” was a centerpiece of a Metropolitan Opera benefit concert this month. His Fourth Symphony was played in recent weeks by the London Philharmonic Orchestra; his Eighth, by the Lithuanian National Opera; his “Silent Music,” on Sunday, in a concert for peace organized by the Berlin Philharmonic. His publisher lists dozens of coming performances of his works.As Russia’s war against Ukraine enters its second month, Valentin Silvestrov, Ukraine’s best-known living composer, has become a musical spokesman for his country. And like millions of Ukrainians, he has been turned into a refugee by the conflict: Over three days in early March, he and his family made their way by bus from their home in Kyiv to Lviv, and from there across Poland to Berlin, where he is now sheltering.“We’re more or less OK,” Silvestrov, 84, said in a video call last week. But he added that he remains in shock about the war.“I don’t know how we lived to see this,” he said.Silvestrov’s subtle, consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in a war-torn country. “Putin’s bombardments of Kyiv have killed and destroyed people, houses and music,” his friend Constantin Sigov, a professor and book publisher, said by phone from that city. “But with some kind of unbelievable sense of hearing, Silvestrov has realized how they might be resurrected.”Born in Kyiv in 1937, Silvestrov made his name in the 1960s with avant-garde scores that challenged Soviet aesthetic norms by hovering between austere modernism and eclectic polystylism. The finely textured contrasts and sharp outbursts of his Symphony No. 3, “Eschatophony,” attracted attention from Western experimentalists; the influential composer and conductor Bruno Maderna led it at Darmstadt, a West German contemporary music hotbed, in 1968.“Right from the beginning, he very clearly showed a very original streak,” the Ukrainian American composer Virko Baley, Silvestrov’s longtime friend, said from his home in Las Vegas.Silvestrov chafed at the Soviet government’s restrictions and demands. After protesting during an official gathering in Kyiv in 1970, he was expelled from the Ukrainian Union of Composers. He was allowed to rejoin three years later, but the punishment contributed to a change already percolating in his writing, as he shifted from noisy scores to soft, intimate ones, like his 24 “Quiet Songs” for voice and piano, a tour de force of stillness and solitude. This tone of quiet meditativeness allowed Silvestrov largely to avoid politics during the rest of the Soviet period, when he commented on current affairs only very rarely and obliquely; his international stature gradually grew.But with the independence of Ukraine in 1991, and especially after the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Maidan protests against Russian influence in 2014, he turned more openly to political and religious subjects. Silvestrov responded to Maidan by composing a series of songs later collected as “Maidan-2014,” for a cappella chorus. (Its 13th movement is the “Prayer for Ukraine” performed at the Met.) The collection also included five new settings of the Ukrainian national anthem.The original versions of the “Maidan-2014” songs were recorded at home, with Silvestrov singing and playing piano, then released on the internet as the revolution unfolded. The choral versions transform his private anger and grief into a communal memorial, solemn and resolute.The current war, Silvestrov said in the recent interview, is “a continuation of the Maidan. Only the Maidan revolution was only in Kyiv, and now all Ukraine has become the Maidan.”Thus his sober, reflective compositions “have again become relevant,” he added — among them the Maidan songs and his choral composition “In Memoriam,” written between 2019 and 2020.As the threats to Kyiv grew in the days after the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, Silvestrov’s daughter and granddaughter urged him to evacuate, and he reluctantly agreed. (His grandson stayed behind as a volunteer with the war effort.) Their circuitous journey westward required last-minute adjustments because of the Russian bombing of Vinnytsia, entailing an overnight stop at a nursery school before they finally arrived in Lviv.In the interview, Silvestrov was more relaxed discussing music, but seemed almost upset with himself for allowing the discussion to drift from the war. He spoke passionately in favor of NATO establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.Since his arrival in Berlin, he has not explicitly commented on the war in music, as he did about the Maidan. Yet more than traces of the conflict exist in short piano pieces that Silvestrov said he “spontaneously” wrote after arriving in Germany — both called “Elegy,” a favorite genre of his.The first is dated March 9, the day after he reached Berlin. He said that its melody “arose” during his escape from Ukraine, traveling toward and across the Polish border, “as we saw endless crowds of refugees, endless cars piled up for kilometers on end, and this feeling of disaster.” He intended its brief, simple melody in thirds with a low bass line to be a “sign of Ukraine,” recalling the country’s folk music and 18th-century choral works by composers like Artemy Vedel.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine. The American conductor, a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years, has resigned from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov. Ukraine’s best-known living composer, Mr. Silvestrov made his way from his home in Kyiv to Berlin, where he is now sheltering. In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko. The superstar Russian soprano faced backlash in Russia after she tried to distance herself from President Vladimir V. Putin with a statement condemning the war. She had previously lost work in the West because of her past support for Mr. Putin.Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.The second elegy, dated March 16, is part of “Pastorale and Elegy,” composed after he had been in Berlin for several days, witnessing from afar the events in Ukraine and growing increasingly despondent. The elegy here is a chaconne with a characteristic dotted funereal rhythm; he called it a “reaction of mourning.”Sigov said that Silvestrov “melts down — refines — the din of history, its massive verbal and sonic constructions.”He is, Sigov added, “a true voice of Kyiv that is connected with the whole world and hopes to speak directly with the world.”Yet Silvestrov’s sudden soaring global reputation has caused him some unease. He said he feels strange, even irritated, “that this misfortune needed to happen for them to begin playing my music.”“Does music not have any value in and of itself without any kind of war?” he added.War had already been on Silvestrov’s mind when he composed “In Memoriam” three years ago, in response to a request for music for the 2020 celebration of May 8, the commemoration of the end of World War II, celebrated in Ukraine since 2015 as the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. Instead of writing an entirely new composition, Silvestrov adapted “Maidan-2014.” He removed the distinctly Ukrainian features, including the anthem settings, and added, as a culmination, a setting of John Donne’s words: “Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”In the interview Silvestrov spoke fervently about this unheeded moral, lamenting the continued timeliness of a composition meant to mark the horrors of decades ago, as another war rages over some of the same lands, threatening again to engulf Europe.“It’s very obvious,” he said just before the call ended, “that this is not a problem of Ukraine and Russia. It is a problem of civilization.”Peter Schmelz is a professor of musicology at Arizona State University and the author of “Sonic Overload: Alfred Schnittke, Valentin Silvestrov and Polystylism in the Late U.S.S.R.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/arts/music/valentin-silvestrov-ukraine-war.html
208,"Good morning. It’s Wednesday. Today we’ll look at the pushback Ukrainian New Yorkers get when they try to persuade their older relatives to flee Ukraine. And on a lighter note, we’ll check out the New Yorkiest new/old jewelry line you can imagine.ImageLiza Gutina, who lives in Brooklyn, can’t persuade her uncle to leave southern Ukraine.Credit...Misha Friedman for The New York TimesThe arguments are happening all over New York City and its suburbs. Over WhatsApp, waiting anxiously for replies, people of Ukrainian descent are cajoling, haranguing and begging their relatives to leave the Ukrainian cities and towns that are under Russian attack.More than four million Ukrainians have left their homeland since Russia invaded. But some of the New Yorkers encounter stubborn resistance from older family members overseas, my colleague Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura learned when she spoke to members of the Ukrainian community in the New York area.Reasons for staying are explained patiently but firmly to younger relatives. There is pride, or a sense of duty to face down Russia, or simply a love for home. There is hope and rationalization. There is distaste for arduous journeys and unfamiliar destinations.“If I left, I don’t know where I’m going. I don’t know how I’m going to survive this journey,” Ludmila Steblina, 83, countered when she was invited to travel to Queens from Kharkiv, where a bomb blew out the balcony windows in her apartment two weeks ago. “If I need to go to the bathroom, who will I ask for help?”Olga Lubchenko, in Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s east, assured her son in Hoboken, N.J., that a local oligarch would keep her safe. Her husband, Taras, simply forwarded a winking emoji — and instructions for firing an antitank missile.Tetiana Guzik, 53, keeping her spirits up during a ban on alcohol sales with a buzz from cherry-liqueur bonbons, told her niece in Queens, “Stop being hysterical and go take your meds.”A universal processTheir responses reflect a culture common to those who lived under the former Soviet Union: Older people — survivors of war, Stalinism and state collapse — are not easily intimidated. Grandmothers, or babushki, are famously formidable.“It’s the relatives in Ukraine who are trying to reassure the ones in New York,” de Freytas-Tamura said.But there is also something universal at work. In every war I’ve covered — Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and more — the choice to stay or go is deeply individual and divides families. There are always people like Guzik, who previously were driven from a home and are refusing to flee again, or the Lubchenko, whose beloved garden makes life worth living.Even after close calls, and even after horrific reports like the recent revelations of atrocities in towns that Russians had occupied, many stay. To survive, they are wired to adapt.Maybe fiction captures it best. In Mohsin Hamid’s novel “Exit West,” a couple builds their marriage as war gradually unbuilds their unnamed society. One bomb is shocking; frequent ones become background noise. Soon it seems normal to dodge bullets on the way to get groceries.When staying is your only weaponAlexander, 65, a mathematician in Kherson, told a niece in Brooklyn he was used to Russians arresting his neighbors for protesting. He was like someone going about normal life in a sci-fi movie, he said: “You know the aliens are there, and every so often, they steal people and then give them back.”Ultimately, some conclude staying is their sole power. A Syrian once told me government forces had destroyed his family and home but couldn’t take his country. Palestinians call this steadfastness, or “sumood.” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, speaking to his country on the eve of the invasion, put it this way: “We are here.”“Somebody has to keep the roots here,” Guzik told her niece.Recently, the alcohol ban lifted for a few hours. Guzik had snagged a bottle of her favorite red wine and was saving it, she said, for the victory.WeatherPrepare for rain early in the day, with winds gusts and a chance of showers in the afternoon.

Like so many creative New Yorkers, during the pandemic he started something new — this time far from his antique shop on Madison Avenue. Tapping into a Brooklyn-centric scene, he came up with a zeitgeisty product, sustainable and locally sourced and dripping with New Yorkiness.As Kate Dwyer wrote in the Times Style section, that product is a line of jewelry called Catbird x Vito’s Gems, a collaboration with Catbird, a Brooklyn-based company that specializes in creations from recycled gems.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.In this case, the stones are from a hoard that Giallo, in his antique-hunting days, said he found in disintegrating envelopes in the messy apartment of an obscure gem dealer just as the building superintendent was about to clear everything away. There were thousands of amethysts, rubies, emeralds, topaz, opals and moonstones.Giallo had fallen out with Warhol in his youth, but later the artist became a frequent customer in his antiques store and bought a few gems. Giallo put the rest away in storage. But his great-grandniece, who works at a sustainability start-up, persuaded him to find a collaborator to make something out of them.Catbird’s website calls the collection “an ode to the luminous life of a quintessential New Yorker,” and you really have to read the whole piece. In it, Giallo takes us back to 1950s New York, where you could dine exquisitely for $1.85 — about $22 today — look for a “lighting guy” in Lord & Taylor and come up with Alexander Calder’s best friend and, as Giallo put it, “sleep in Central Park without worrying that you were in danger.”What we’re readingMake art and live on an island for free?

209,"As artillery shells fall, pregnant women are delivering prematurely, being shuttled in and out of bomb shelters or having babies in basements without even a midwife to help. Tens of thousands more are displaced.By Andrew E. KramerPhotographs by Lynsey AddarioApril 7, 2022KYIV, Ukraine — Before the war, Alina Shynkar’s gynecologist advised her to avoid stress during her pregnancy, suggesting she spend time “just watching cartoons and being silly.” It was simple enough advice, but not so easy to follow after air-raid sirens wailed, artillery booms rattled windows and vicious street fighting broke out a few miles away from her maternity hospital.Then, keeping calm for her baby became Ms. Shynkar’s quiet, personal battle in the Ukraine war. She checked into Maternity Hospital No. 5 in the capital, Kyiv, before the war began in late February for bed rest because of a risk of preterm labor, only to witness the hospital unravel into a chaotic, panicked state weeks later.“The girls were under so much stress they started to deliver” prematurely, she said. Doctors in her hospital moved frightened pregnant women, some of them already in labor, in and out of a bomb shelter multiple times a day. Some were crying and some were bleeding.“They were scared,” Ms. Shynkar recalled. “It was hard to see.”The Russian assault on Ukraine has been a nightmare for expectant mothers, particularly in cities like Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv that have been under almost constant bombardment from the beginning of the war in late February.In the besieged city of Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, last month, Russian artillery struck a maternity hospital, resulting in the death of a pregnant woman and wounding a number of others, according to the Ukrainian authorities.ImageDalina Levendarrenko, who is pregnant with twins, was getting a check-up at Maternity Hospital No. 5 in Kyiv last month right before air-raid sirens sounded.ImageAnna, 37, was comforted by her partner, Yuri, as he timed her contractions in the hospital’s basement shelter last month.Women in war zones throughout the country have been forced to give birth in cold, decrepit basements or subway stations crowded with people cowering from shelling, and without electricity, running water or midwives to assist them.And the recent reprieve as Russian forces pulled back won’t help all that much in many locations. As of late March, Russian missiles, bombs and artillery had destroyed at least 23 hospitals and health clinics.Even those pregnant women fortunate enough to escape the war torn areas are deeply stressed, whether racing in and out of shelters or enduring arduous and perilous journeys to the relative safety of western Ukraine or to neighboring European countries.An estimated 265,000 Ukrainian women were pregnant when the war broke out, according to the United Nations Population Fund, the organization’s sexual and reproductive health agency. About 80,000 births are expected in the next three months.The war poses both immediate and long-term risks to mothers, fathers and newborns. Among them are premature births, which can lead to a host of complications both immediately and later in life.“Prematurity because of the conditions of the war sets the baby up for death or for complications for the rest of his life,” said Dr. Jeanne Conry, the president of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. While data is not available yet, she said that doctors in Ukraine were reporting an increase in premature babies, who are more likely to have respiratory, neurological and digestive problems later.ImageA patient at Maternity Hospital No. 5 took the stairs to the basement shelter as air-raid sirens wailed last month.ImageAlina Shynkar, 34, who has been on bed rest in the hospital since before the start of the war, lying in the basement as a siren wailed last month. “I’m trying to focus on the baby,” she said.Dr. Conry said a lack of access to medication to prevent postpartum hemorrhage could result in an increase in deaths of mothers. Babies are at risk, she said, because physicians might not have immediate access to the necessary equipment to resuscitate them, and they have only moments to catch their first breath.Evidence from World War II shows that starvation in pregnant mothers can lead to high blood pressure and diabetes in the child later in life. Dr. Andrew Weeks, a professor of international maternal health at the University of Liverpool, said that war makes it harder for babies to be monitored during labor, which raises the chances of brain damage in the child.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 23, 2022, 9:58 a.m. ETTop Kyiv official says Ukraine has destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson.Ukraine’s military warns against gathering for nighttime Easter vigils.Armed with new powerful weapons, Ukraine is limiting Russian advances, military analysts say.Dislocation and stress are affecting virtually all of Ukraine’s pregnant women. Doctors say that refugees who are pregnant and their babies face a higher risk of disease, death during childbirth and mental health issues that can carry over after the birth. Displaced people have higher rates of premature birth, low birth weight and stillbirth, according to doctors.Some pregnant women in Ukraine have had elevated blood pressure and, in isolated instances, a stress-related inability to produce breast milk, which can be temporary, doctors said. Stress has also caused pre-eclampsia, a complication of elevated blood pressure that can be lethal.When an air-raid siren wailed one recent day at the hospital, the stairway filled with women from the maternity ward clutching their bellies and shuffling down to the shelter, a warren of low-ceilinged corridors and storage rooms. One room was converted into a makeshift post-operation observation room and neonatal site. Another, still cluttered with filing cabinets, became a birthing room. Women rested on mats on the floor.ImageYulia Sobchenko, 27, the day after giving birth to Mykhailo. He “is a child of war,” she said of her son.ImageUkrainian nurses tending to newborns in a makeshift basement maternity ward in Kyiv last month.Dr. Olena Yarushchuk, the deputy chief doctor at Maternity Hospital No. 5, directed the women to benches along the walls, where they sat in near silence in the dim space, waiting the few minutes for the imminent danger to pass.Dr. Yarushchuk said she had made video calls to assist women giving birth in the basements of apartment buildings in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, a few dozen miles away but, at the time, cut off from the capital by fighting.“Our work has changed,” she said.After Russian forces retreated from Bucha last week, dozens of corpses were found strewn around the city — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some, with hands bound, had been shot in the head.In Kyiv, another complication is a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew that leaves pregnant women wholly reliant on ambulances, which can operate at any time. Any travel by private car, whatever the circumstances, risks an accidental shooting at a checkpoint by jittery Ukrainian soldiers patrolling for Russian saboteur groups after curfew.Yulia Sobchenko, 27, said she went into labor around midnight on March 20 and took an ambulance to the hospital. But she was delayed by Ukrainian soldiers at checkpoints who, fearful of saboteurs, insisted on opening the ambulance door to verify that it was a woman about to give birth.Her child was delivered at 2:55 a.m., and within two hours, she was ushered into the basement because of an air-raid alert.“Me in my sleeping shirt and with a cloth between my legs and a tiny baby just after giving birth, and my husband with all our bags, had to go to the basement,” she said.Her son, Mykhailo, was healthy and weighed 6 pounds 3 ounces at birth, she said, and “is a child of war.”ImageAn estimated 265,000 Ukrainian women were pregnant when the war broke out, according to the United Nations Population Fund.ImageThe hospital allows women, their husbands and children to check in three weeks before their due dates to prevent them from getting separated from the hospital by the shifting front lines.After the birth, these families face other troubles. New mothers who recently left Maternity Hospital No. 5 have said they are unable to breastfeed, something Dr. Yarushchuk attributed to stress.Finding calm was the strategy for Ms. Shynkar, who worked as an event organizer before the war. Her maternity hospital in Kyiv has allowed women, their husbands and children to check in three weeks before their due dates to prevent them from getting separated from the medical facility by the shifting front lines of the war.Speaking from her hospital room a few days before she gave birth on March 25, she beamed with a broad smile and seemed so calm as to be almost unaware of the swirl of lethal violence just outside. She said she never watched or read any news of the war.“I’m trying to focus on the baby,” she said. “Can I help fight the war? I want to, but I cannot, not now. But I cannot panic,” she said. “I can keep myself safe. That is what I can do.”Ms. Shynkar gave birth to a daughter, Adeline.“It was a natural birth in a very pleasant, intimate setting,” she said of her delivery at the hospital. “My husband was present at the birth and cut the umbilical cord. To be honest, I have no idea if there were air-raid sirens because I was completely in the process.”It was a small personal victory amid a much larger battle raging all around her.For herself and for her country, she gave her baby the middle name Victoria.ImageVladimir Shyian kissing his wife, Lina Chayka, as she held their 1-day-old baby, Maxim, last month in the basement shelter of Maternity Hospital No. 5 as warning sirens sounded outside.Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Emma Bubola from London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/world/europe/ukraine-mothers-birth.html

212,"KRAKOW, Poland — A peace activist in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv rolled 109 baby strollers into a square last week to represent the children who had been killed in the war with Russia. Hours later, the image was available to millions on their phones.A little girl sheltering in a basement in Kyiv sang a haunting rendition of “Let it Go,” from the movie “Frozen,” and the clip sped around the world. A cellist performed a somber Bach suite on a street in Kharkiv, with debris and the windowless facade of a damaged building serving as his backdrop, and thousands watched.These heart-wrenching glimpses of life in Ukraine since the Russian invasion have become powerful ammunition in an information war playing out on social media. For some, the messaging has become a crucial battleground complementing the Ukrainian military’s performance on the physical front lines, as images and information ripple out on Instagram, Facebook, Telegram and TikTok.“We are experiencing the war very viscerally through social media feeds,” said Emerson Brooking, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international-affairs think tank. “The transformation of Ukraine into a nation at war is just stark. And so it has especially resonated with Western audiences.”Social media has long been a place where activists organize and share news, as well as a place to recruit fighters or seed disinformation. But in this battle, the proliferation of pictures showing the human toll of the war has helped Ukraine project an image of a country of stalwart survivors with the moral high ground, while casting Russia as a merciless aggressor — an impression reinforced by global condemnation and sanctions.ImageUsing a phone among the debris of a destroyed school in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, this month. Pictures of the human toll of the war have helped the country project an image of steadfastness amid suffering.Credit...Viacheslav Ratynskyi/ReutersMr. Brooking said that Ukraine had an additional advantage because Russia had not engaged in the same level of disinformation as it has in the past, in part because the government in Moscow has denied the extent of the war.But Russian government accounts have actively questioned the veracity of verified Ukrainian civilian accounts appearing on social media.Those efforts have only deepened Anastasiya Magerramova’s determination to show the world the devastation in Ukraine. Ms. Magerramova, 27, press secretary for the Okhmatdyt pediatric hospital in Kyiv, said she feels that she is fighting her own battle — a struggle for truth alongside the conflict among soldiers — as her compatriots take up arms.Ms. Magerramova and a handful of colleagues have documented the civilians streaming in with injuries. She and some others have moved into the hospital, sleeping in the wards and working around the clock, phones in hand and cameras at the ready. They post the images on Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram with detailed descriptions of what happened to those shown in the pictures.“I feel that my job is important, it is also like a weapon,” she said. “I want to show the people the consequences of this war: poor children with shrapnel in their legs, their arms, in their heads. It’s not OK, it shouldn’t be like this.”The hospital’s social media accounts have become a running documentation of the civilian toll, showing — often in excruciating detail — the suffering of those caught up in the war.On Saturday, Ms. Magerramova posted a photo on social media of a young mother, Olga, who had used her body to shield her baby from shelling. The family’s travails — the father was also injured — instantly reverberated around the world, picked up first by the government, then by activists, Ukrainian news media and later, international outlets.ImageA mother, Olga, with her baby and the child’s father, Dmytro, at the Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv. Olga had used her own body to shield her baby from shelling.Credit...Okhmatdyt HospitalThe personal stories keep Ms. Magerramova’s phone ringing as she fields calls from journalists around the world.Civil society groups and humanitarian organizations based inside and outside of Ukraine have also played a vital role in amplifying voices, turning into a sort of activist army to verify and disseminate information.Marta Barandiy set up Promote Ukraine, a nongovernmental media hub, in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

Her group translates reports from those on the ground and from government sources into English, and this week began staging news conferences to further amplify the stories.Some of her group’s volunteers are working out of a Ukrainian civil society hub recently opened in a European Parliament building in Brussels.Maryna Yaroshevych, head of advocacy for Promote Ukraine, said she thought the power of some of the images had already contributed to public pressure for sanctions on Russia.“They are opening the hearts of Europeans and people around the world,” she said. “This way, average people can pressure politicians to intervene and do something.”ImageA protest in Paris this month against the Russian invasion. “Average people can pressure politicians to intervene and do something,” one Ukrainian activist said of the power of social media.Credit...Christophe Petit Tesson/EPA, via ShutterstockWhile some information sharing is coordinated, many of the most wrenching images have spread organically, Mr. Brooking of the Atlantic Council said.There have also been a number people aggregating details shared on Telegram accounts run by the government and written in Ukrainian, and then sharing them on Twitter in English, putting them in front of the eyes of thousands of international journalists.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.“There are definitely funnels which are releasing more raw war footage into Twitter,” Mr. Brooking said. “So it is coordinated in that fashion, but after those images are released, my sense is really viral momentum is based more on the images themselves.”Because the fighting has made some parts of Ukraine inaccessible to all but a handful of journalists, the personal tales shared by civilians on social media have become even more compelling.Nadezhda Sukhorukova, who managed to escape the besieged southern port of Mariupol and is now near Odessa, a city further to the west, with her son, has described living a “hell” as the Russians shelled Mariupol incessantly. For weeks, she hid out in a basement, only daring to venture out for necessities.“A neighbor said that God left Mariupol. He was afraid of everything he saw,” Ms. Sukhorukova wrote in a series of Facebook posts after her escape late last week.The only international journalists who had remained in recent weeks were a team from The Associated Press. But they were forced to flee last week after appearing on a Russian hit list.So Ms. Sukhorukova’s account, like the other sporadic retellings that have filtered out, has been crucial to conveying the devastation in Mariupol.“The dead lie in the entrances, on the balconies, in the yards,’’ Ms. Sukhorukova wrote in one of the posts shared thousand of times.She said in an interview by phone that she did not expect her story to be of interest to anyone and had composed the ideas in her head when the internet was cut “just to not go crazy.” Her first posts were to tell friends that she was alive.“Once, I thought that if I write, everything will change,” she said. “But, unfortunately, no one is taking people out of the city, no one is closing the sky.”ImageThe aftermath of the shelling of a residential district in Mariupol, Ukraine, this month.

214,"The sinking of the Russian warship Moskva is being celebrated by Ukrainians as an iconic victory, including in a new song by one of the country’s most popular rock musicians.Vadym Krasnooky, the lead singer of Mad Heads, on Saturday debuted an acoustic version of “Cruiser Moskva” at a news conference. He said he wrote the song after the sinking of the Moskva, the pride of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which the Pentagon confirmed Friday was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles.Mad Heads, which has played rock, hillbilly and psychobilly music since its founding 25 years ago, had stopped performing when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Mr. Krasnooky appeared solo with an acoustic guitar in Lviv to perform the new song, which includes the refrain: “Oh the ship, oh the ship, Moskva burn! Burn! Burn in hell forever.”“We have to find a way to channel all this hate,” he told The New York Times.Leader of Mad Heads Vadym Krasnooky presented a song dedicated to the Moskva cruiser sunk by the Ukrainian military.«The fact the flagship sank is very symbolic and good sign of where all this russian military «machine» and whole regime is going», he saidhttps://t.co/mgtKIhuuSM— Ukraine Media Center (@CenterUkraine) April 16, 2022 The song’s lyrics reference an incident from the beginning of the war, when a border guard on a rocky outpost of Ukraine reportedly responded to Russian calls for surrender with an expletive telling the ship what it could do.

215,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russian tanks were rolling over the border and Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was in the grips of fear and panic. Street fighting broke out and a Russian armored column, barreling into the city, advanced to within two miles of the office of President Volodymyr Zelensky.In those tense first days of the war, almost everyone — Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, military analysts and many Western officials — expected the Ukrainian leadership to fracture. Instead, Mr. Zelensky decided to personally remain in the capital, taking selfies as he traversed Kyiv to reassure his people. And he ordered his senior aides, many Cabinet members and much of his government to also stay put, despite the risks.It was a crystallizing moment for Mr. Zelensky’s government, ensuring a wide array of agencies kept running efficiently and in sync. Leading politicians put aside the sharp-elbowed infighting that had defined Ukrainian politics for decades and instead created a largely united front that continues today.No senior officials defected or fled, and the bureaucracy quickly went onto a war footing.“In the first days of the war, everybody was in shock, and everybody was thinking what to do — stay in Kyiv or evacuate,” said Serhiy Nikiforov, Mr. Zelensky’s spokesman. “The president’s decision was no one goes anywhere. We stay in Kyiv, and we fight. That cemented it.”Image“We will not lay down any weapons,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted to Facebook on the second day of the Russian invasion. “We will defend our state.”Credit...Volodymyr Zelensky, via FacebookTo much of the world, Mr. Zelensky is best known for appearing by video link with a daily message of courage and defiance, to rally his people and exhort allies to provide weapons, money and moral support. On Sunday he commanded global attention again in a meeting in Kyiv with two top American officials, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, who pledged more military support and — in a move of symbolic importance — said the United States would seek to reopen its embassy in Kyiv. But behind the scenes, Mr. Zelensky’s success so far is also rooted in the government’s ability to operate smoothly and take measures to help people cope, such as sweeping deregulation to keep the economy afloat, and to provide essential goods and services.By loosening rules around transporting cargo, for instance, the government was able to address a dire risk of food shortages in Kyiv, the capital, in the early days of the war. And in March he dropped business taxes to 2 percent — and then only if the owner wanted to pay.“Pay if you can but if you cannot there are no questions asked,” Mr. Zelensky said at the time.More contentiously, he combined six television stations that previously competed against one another into one outlet for news. The merger, he said, was necessary for national security, but it frustrated political opponents and free speech advocates.ImageMr. Zelensky, center, on the set of his television show, “Servant of the People,” in February 2019, two months before being elected.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesHe has also forged a truce with his primary domestic political opponent, former President Petro O. Poroshenko, with whom he had been feuding right up until the start of the war.A tremendous wartime effect of rallying around the flag undoubtedly eased Mr. Zelensky’s job, said Volodymyr Yermolenko, editor in chief of Ukraine World, a magazine covering politics. “The peculiar thing about Ukrainian politics is the agency comes from society, not the political leaders,’’ he said. “Zelensky is who he is due to the Ukrainian people, who are behind him, showing courage.”He added that, “this is not to undermine his efforts” and credited Mr. Zelensky for adapting his populist, prewar politics into an effective leadership style in the crucible of conflict.These days Mr. Zelensky’s workplace on Bankova Street is a hushed, darkened space crowded with soldiers; there are firing positions protected by sandbags in the corridors and on stairway landings. “We were prepared to fight exactly in this building,” said Mr. Nikiforov.A former comedic actor, the Ukrainian leader has surrounded himself with a group of loyalists from his days in television, relationships that prompted accusations of cronyism in the past but that have served him well during the conflict by keeping his leadership team on the same page. And Mr. Zelensky has structured his days in a way that works for him.Mr. Zelensky receives one-on-one phone briefings from Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of the armed forces, multiple times a day and often first thing in the morning, aides and advisers said.This is followed by a morning video conference with the prime minister, sometimes other members of the Cabinet, and military and intelligence agency leaders in a format that combines military and civilian decision making, according to Mr. Nikiforov, his spokesman.ImageMr. Zelensky delivering a virtual address last month to the U.S. Congress.Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York TimesTo be sure, Mr. Zelensky’s video addresses — to the U.S. Congress, to the British Parliament, to the Israeli Knesset and other governments — remain the defining and most effective element of his wartime role. The Ukrainian and Russian armies are still in pitched battles in the eastern plains, but in the information war Kyiv has clearly won.Delivered with passion by a former actor with a keen sense of narrative and drama, Mr. Zelensky’s speeches have rallied his countrymen and galvanized international support.Some are ad-libbed and others more scripted. A 38-year-old former journalist and political analyst, Dmytro Lytvyn, has reportedly served as Mr. Zelensky’s speechwriter. Mr. Nikiforov, the spokesman, confirmed the president is collaborating with a writer but declined to say with whom.Politically, Mr. Zelensky made some early moves that allowed him to reduce any internal strife that might detract from the war effort.Among them was the uneasy rapprochement with Mr. Poroshenko, who had sharply criticized Mr. Zelensky since losing to him in the 2019 election. Their squabbling continued even as Russia massed troops on the border, with Mr. Zelensky’s prosecutor putting Mr. Poroshenko under house arrest for various politically tinged cases.ImageMr. Zelensky and his wife, Olena Zelenska, casting their ballots in April 2019 in Kyiv.Credit...Brendan Hoffman/Getty ImagesBut the day that Russia invaded, the two leaders reached an understanding. “I met with Mr. Zelensky, we shook hands,” Mr. Poroshenko said in March. “We said that we are starting from scratch, he can firmly count on my support, because now we have one enemy. And the name of this enemy is Putin.”Mr. Zelensky outlawed another main opposition faction, a Russian-leaning political party.It has helped that Mr. Zelensky’s political party, Servant of the People, won a majority of seats in Parliament in 2019, allowing him before the war to appoint a cabinet of loyalists. Past Ukrainian governments were divided between feuding presidents and opposition-controlled cabinets.“Not on paper, but in reality, it’s all one big team,” said Igor Novikov, a former foreign policy adviser. “It’s very close knit.”Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister of economy and now an economic adviser to the president’s office, likened Ukrainian politics to “loved ones fighting.”“It’s a family fight,” he said. “But family comes first.”The inner circle is made up largely of media, movie and comedy industry veterans with backgrounds similar to Mr. Zelensky’s.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff and a former movie producer, is widely viewed as the second most-powerful politician in Ukraine, though the constitutional successor is the Speaker of Parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, who early in the war was evacuated to western Ukraine. Mr. Yermak oversees foreign and economic policy.Other key advisers are Mykhailo Podolyak, a former journalist and editor who is a negotiator with the Russians; Serhiy Shefir, a former screenwriter, now a domestic political adviser; and Kirill Tymoshenko, a former videographer now overseeing humanitarian aid.The top military command is made up of officers, including General Zaluzhnyi, experienced in fighting Russia through the eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine.ImageMr. Zelensky visiting a military training base in February.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesIn the first days of the war Mr. Zelensky set three priorities for his government’s ministries, according to Mr. Mylovanov: weapons procurement, shipments of food and other goods, and maintaining supplies of gasoline and diesel. The ministries were told to rewrite regulations to ensure swift delivery on all three tracks.That was perhaps most helpful in the frantic rush early on to get food to Kyiv, which was at risk of being besieged and starved.With the supply chain disrupted, the presidential office brokered an arrangement among grocery chains, trucking companies and volunteer drivers to establish a single trucking service supplying all food stores. Stores would post a request on a website, and whichever driver was available would fill the order either for free or for the cost of gasoline.Perhaps the most controversial move Mr. Zelensky made was to combine the six television newsrooms into one channel with a single report. Omitted from the group was the main opposition television station, Channel 5, affiliated with Mr. Poroshenko.Mr. Zelensky positioned the move as necessary for national security. Opponents viewed it as a troubling instance of the government suppressing dissent.“I do hope that wisdom will prevail, and the intention is not to use this to keep political competitors down,” said Volodymyr Ariev, a member in Mr. Poroshenko’s Solidarity political party.ImageMr. Zelensky addressing the Ukrainian Parliament in December.

Then parliamentarians gather in the stately, neo-Classical chamber, quickly vote, then scatter.Mr. Mylovanov, the economic adviser to the president, said Ukraine’s pluralistic political culture would bounce back.

216,"A number of high-profile names were added Friday to the European Union’s list of sanctioned individuals as part of the bloc’s fifth package of measures against Russia, none more personal for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than his own daughters.The daughters, Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Putina, who has been living under an assumed name, Maria Vorontsova, were among the dozens of new individuals targeted with asset freezes and travel bans by the European Union.Mr. Putin has traditionally been extremely secretive about his daughters, barely mentioning their names and offering no details about their lives in public. At least one of the women has in the past lived in the Netherlands.The new E.U. sanctions included prominent figures in Mr. Putin’s close environment, including some who have been linked to him for decades.Among them is Herman Gref, one of the most trusted technocrats in Mr. Putin’s economic policy team. He was the architect of Mr. Putin’s economic reforms during his first tenure as president, helping to set the stage for an economic boom in Russia that abruptly ended with the 2008 global recession.For the past 15 years, Mr. Gref, who met Mr. Putin in the 1990s in St. Petersburg, has been the chief executive of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest financial institution. Sberbank has not been sanctioned by the European Union, in contrast to several other major banks.Another prominent name on the new E.U. list is Boris Rotenberg, who can trace his relationship with Mr. Putin to much earlier times.In the 1960s, he practiced judo in the same school with the future president. Following Mr. Putin’s accession to the Kremlin, Mr. Rotenberg, together with his brother Arkady, cobbled together a pipeline construction empire, winning lucrative contracts from Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas giant.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/europe/eu-putin-sanctions-daughters.html
217,"NOVA BASAN, Ukraine — Badly frightened and hungry, residents of Nova Basan, a town east of Kyiv, emerged from their cottages and farmhouses on Monday, and described living through the terrifying ordeal of the Russian occupation — detentions, threats and a strict curfew that confined them to their homes with no outside communication for more than a month.Nova Basan, about 60 miles east of the Ukrainian capital, is one of a stretch of towns and villages retaken from Russian control after battles through the last week of March, and just now coming back to life.“It was terrible,” said Mykola Dyachenko, the official responsible for the administration of the town and surrounding villages. “People were not expecting such things.” He said he was among some 20 men who were held prisoner by Russian troops for 25 days during the occupation.He looked exhausted, his face waxy and pale. He said he had been put through what he called a mock execution 15 times while being questioned about local Ukrainian territorial defense forces and ammunition stored in the area.His interrogators fired an assault rifle over his head during the questioning, he said. His eyes were bound with sticky tape but he heard and felt the gunshot above his head. “It was psychological pressure,” he said. “They were trying to kick out of me information that I was not sharing.”ImageVolunteer fighters in Nova Basan searching a destroyed Russian armored fighting vehicle for anything salvageable.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesTwo other men also described being detained by Russian troops and told of soldiers beating them with rifle butts, and punching and kicking them. One described being tied up with his arms suspended. Another, Oleksiy Bryzgalin, 38, a construction worker, said he was strapped to a chair with a grenade between his legs for 30 hours and also had a gun fired beside the side of his head during interrogation.The detainees were moved around and held in barns and cellars and fed only two potatoes a day, with only one toilet break daily, Mr. Bryzgalin said.The detainees said they escaped from their makeshift jail as the Russian troops were preparing to withdraw last Wednesday. Five days later Mr. Bryzgalin said he still had pain in his legs from the cramped conditions and had trouble sleeping.The community administrator, Mr. Dyachenko, said he did not know the level of civilian casualties yet and said he was only just starting to organize search teams to check on residents. On Monday, he was heading out to investigate the report of an execution on Feb. 28 of six people by Russian soldiers in a nearby village, he said. That was just after Russian troops had arrived in the area, he said.Mr. Dyachenko said he also knew of a civilian killed in his car at a gas station when the Russian troops first entered the town. And, he said, a wounded member of the territorial defense had been held prisoner with him but was taken away and not seen since. The Kremlin has denied any Russian involvement in atrocities.Despite the fear and rough treatment of the civilian population, in the end Russian troops may have suffered more casualties than the townspeople. The Russian departure was part of a planned withdrawal announced by Moscow a week ago but it ended in a chaotic and bloody retreat after a fierce tank battle last Thursday, said soldiers and volunteers who took part, and residents of the town.On Monday Ukrainian soldiers were piling the bodies of dead Russian soldiers into a trailer pulled by an army jeep. The soldiers were killed when a Ukrainian tank sneaked close to the entrance of the town and opened fire on the Russian checkpoint guarding the main intersection, according to soldiers and volunteers who took part.ImageThe remains of 10 Russian soldiers that had been collected from various points around the recently liberated village of Nova Basan.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times“It’s the first lot we have picked up,” said Sr. Sgt. Andreiy Soroka, 38, the Ukrainian soldier in charge. “Nine and a half bodies,” he said matter-of-factly.Four of the men had died in the armored personnel carrier blown up by a Ukrainian tank, he said. Others among the dead Russian soldiers were a captain found in a nearby building, and an 18-year-old conscript in the garden of a house who had been shot, Sergeant Soroka said.A destroyed tank and armored vehicle on the road were leftovers of the battle, when a Ukrainian tank opened fire on the Russian vehicles. They were the tail end of the Russian presence, which had begun packing and leaving the town a day earlier.Russian troops had suffered a major defeat days earlier in the town of Lukyanivka, and had failed to retake that town, said the commander of a volunteer battalion, Oleksiy Serediuk, who took part in the fighting. “They were disappointed and they started moving out of several places,” he said of the Russian troops. That led the Ukrainian army command to pursue the retreating army, he said.“The military command made a very smart decision, first to make their withdrawal a chaotic rout and second to cut their escape route.”ImageAn intact but immobilized Russian armored fighting vehicle that had been hit by Ukrainian fire and then crashed into a row of shops in Nova Basan.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesHe said the battle in Nova Basan was chaotic as the Russians had to fight their way out and the Ukrainians tried to cut their escape route.

A group of men, retired taxi drivers, examined the damage, while a line of women waited for the first sale of fresh meat in more than a month.On Monday, it had been four days since the Ukrainian troops regained control of the town, but many of the residents were only just starting to venture out of their homes. The relief on their faces was heartfelt.“I have been sitting at home and trembling,” said Maria Rudenko, 82, who peered nervously round the corner of her street before approaching a car handing out food assistance. “I was so frightened at the shooting that I am scared to walk around.”During the occupation, Russian troops searched houses and confiscated cellphones and computers and ordered people to stay indoors, residents said. With communications and utilities down, and with people unable to go to the shops, they began to feel hungry and scared.“Sometimes I sat three nights without a candle,” Ms. Rudenko said. The electricity was down in most of the town, and the gas was still out. “Everyone ran away here and I was left. I had only potatoes and some cucumbers to eat.”Further down the street toward the southern edge of town, three women friends began to weep as they collected bags of food from a group of volunteers.ImageCivilians in Nova Basan thanking volunteer fighters who delivered aid to locals.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times“Every day was hard but the hardest day was when we were being liberated,” said Olha Vdovichenko, 70. “Everyone was hiding inside and we were praying. The shelling started at six in the morning and went on until seven in the evening without pause.”By the time everything fell quiet, Ukrainian soldiers were already in the town searching for Russians soldiers left behind. A woman, who gave her name as Tania, said one of them asked her if there were any of the enemy around. “I was trembling and I said, ‘Who are you?’” she recounted. “He said ‘Ours.’” She ended up cooking borscht in two big pots for the whole Ukrainian unit.The Ukrainian soldiers also told Olha Maysak, 66, that the town was freed. “At 6 p.m. the lads came by to tell us,” she said.But her neighbor, Ms. Vdovichenko, did not realize it was over. She woke at 7 the next morning and heard some men talking outside.“He said we are free, we are liberated,” she said. “That’s how I knew.”ImageOleksiy Serediuk, a commander in the Territorial Defense Forces, was hugged by a woman in the village of Nova Basan while delivering aid to civilians in the area.

218,"On Wednesday, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (better known as the venue for The Championships at Wimbledon) joined with the British Lawn Tennis Association in banning all Russian and Belarusian players from competing at its event — at least, according to the L.T.A.’s statement, “whilst the current situation continues in accordance with the U.K. government guidance in place.” While acknowledging that “individual Russian and Belarusian players may not agree with the actions of their Governments and this is a situation beyond their control,” the statement also said “The continuing participation of Russian and Belarusian nationals at events risks providing a boost to these regimes when there is an unprecedented international effort to isolate them and sanction their actions.” It’s the first time Wimbledon has banned players from specific countries since the end of World War II, when athletes from Germany and Japan were barred from competing.The move was met with significant criticism, including from the Women’s Tennis Association and the Association of Tennis Professionals. As Reuters reported, “Both tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions” following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but both groups said the move to ban individual players amounted to “discrimination.” Before the Wimbledon ban was announced, the New Yorker contributor Gerald Marzorati noted that the Russian tennis pro Andrey Rublev made a public statement against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As ESPN reports, there are nine players from Russia and Belarus in the current top 30 world tennis rankings, both men and women.But some hailed the decision. The Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins wrote on Thursday that the message the Wimbledon ban sent was “necessary,” adding, “​​Even the most innocent Russians will be price-payers for the rapacious actions of Vladimir Putin’s regime.”In their statement, the All England Club and Wimbledon said, “Given the profile of The Championships” — one of tennis’s four major Grand Slam events — “in the United Kingdom and around the world, it is our responsibility to play our part in the widespread efforts of Government, industry, sporting and creative institutions to limit Russia’s global influence through the strongest means possible.”But is it? And if so, why?Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been devastating, with thousands of civilians enduring bombardment and the prospect of starvation. According to many reports, Ukrainian civilians have been subjected to crimes including torture and rape. Ukrainian officials have said that the death toll in the city of Mariupol may have reached 20,000. Yes, political and economic stability have been jarred by the outbreak of war in Europe, but the principal toll of the fighting has been the human cost. It seems pretty clear to me, then, that any type of sanctions on the Russian or Belarusian governments or individuals should be implemented with the aim of making the Russian government stop bombing Ukrainian cities and killing Ukrainian civilians. The point isn’t, or shouldn’t be, the more nebulous goal to “limit Russia’s global influence.” The point should be to stop the carnage by ending the war, and bans and sanctions should be directed as precisely as possible toward that end. The problem with Russia’s war in Ukraine is not Russian citizens, even famous professional tennis players. The problem also isn’t a restaurant, such as Russia House, in Washington, D.C., which reportedly was subjected to vandalism in the days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The problem with Russia’s war in Ukraine is, well, Russia’s war in Ukraine.The idea behind sanctioning Russia’s economic engines was to limit Russia’s financial firepower and make continuing the war less feasible in the long term. The idea behind sanctioning Russian oligarchs living in London and elsewhere was, as the congressional foreign policy adviser Paul Massaro framed it last month, to “do the most damage to” President Putin’s “rogue state.”But limiting Russian influence by banning Russian and Belarusian tennis players from Wimbledon is unlikely to bring about a swifter end to the war in Ukraine or concretely damage Putin’s regime. Where’s the evidence that Russia’s president will be swayed to rethink his military aggression if these athletes aren’t allowed to compete at Wimbledon? What makes the governing bodies of Wimbledon and the L.T.A. think Putin will be devastated that Daniil Medvedev and Victoria Azarenka will not be heating up the courts at The Championships? Sports Illustrated reported that one player doubted Putin even cared about tennis.By taking this action, Wimbledon hasn’t banned a team competing under the Russian or Belarusian flag. Tennis players are independent contractors. At major tournaments like Wimbledon, they aren’t competing for their countries. Even if fans back home cheer for them, they are competing for themselves.So, what is the ban doing? It’s doing something. It’s performing the act of action. And perhaps that’s the point. The do-something impulse is among our strongest, even when, in many cases, there’s very little you, I or Wimbledon really can do to make the Russian government stop its campaign of violence against Ukrainians. Inaction can feel weak, but action, even when it’s ineffective, often feels strong.But feeling strong isn’t the same thing as doing the right thing, or even doing something that makes sense. Russian tennis players didn’t invade Ukraine. And punishing Russian tennis players won’t stop the war in Ukraine. But apparently the ban makes the governing bodies running Wimbledon and the L.T.A. feel as if they have done something. And seemingly, that’s good enough for them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/opinion/russia-wimbledon.html
219,"Historical parallels often spring to mind when it comes to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In the brutality and megalomania of Vladimir Putin, many are reminded of Adolf Hitler. In the soaring rhetoric and heroic defiance of Volodymyr Zelensky, others hear echoes of Winston Churchill. In the moral outrage but relatively cautious policies of Joe Biden, there’s a touch of George — Wouldn’t Be Prudent — H.W. Bush.And in Wednesday’s decision by the Boston Athletic Association to prohibit runners from Russia and Belarus from competing in this year’s Boston Marathon, we recall the words of Otter, one of the frat house characters from “National Lampoon’s Animal House”: “I think this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.”In announcing its decision — which applies to residents of both countries but not to Russians or Belarusians living abroad — the president of the B.A.A. explained in a news release that “we believe that running is a global sport, and as such, we must do what we can to show our support to the people of Ukraine.” In an email, the association told me that a total of 63 athletes will be removed from the marathon and a five-kilometer race that precedes it.Superficially, the decision is of a piece with other recent cancellations of Russian performers: the removal of Valery Gergiev as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic for refusing to denounce the invasion of Ukraine; the nixing of the planned summer performances at London’s Royal Opera House of the Bolshoi Ballet, which has long been an arm of the Russian state; the Met’s cancellation of the soprano Anna Netrebko for her past association with Putin (though she subsequently did issue a statement denouncing the war).One can debate the merits of these decisions, and there’s always a slippery slope when it comes to making cultural choices based on political considerations. If we’re going to ban Russian artists and athletes for the invasion of Ukraine, why not their Chinese counterparts for Beijing’s depredations in Xinjiang? Why shouldn’t other countries do the same thing to American musicians and athletes the next time an American president deploys forces to some place where they hadn’t been invited?But however you come down on these questions, at least there’s the argument that Gergiev, Netrebko and the Bolshoi are associated with the Kremlin’s power structure. What about those 63 runners who just want to complete a famously challenging 26.2-mile course?I asked the B.A.A. what responsibility the banned athletes have for the policies of their government. No reply. I also asked whether exceptions would be made for runners who made public statements denouncing the invasion of Ukraine. No reply on this, either.The questions must be difficult to answer because it’s hard to think of any justification for the B.A.A.’s indiscriminate discrimination. So let’s help them think this one through.First point: Thousands of Russians have, in recent weeks, courageously risked imprisonment by publicly protesting the war. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets to denounce electoral fraud in the August 2020 elections, only to be met by a “reign of terror” from the government of Aleksandr Lukashenko. Clearly, not all Russians and Belarusians support their leaders — a point the B.A.A. should seek to honor, not ignore.Second point: To reduce citizens of a state to an identity with the politics of their government is not just a gross moral simplification. It’s also a gift to people like Putin and Lukashenko, who want nothing more than to have people believing that they alone speak for all their people, and that their policies are universally supported. It should be possible for Russians and Belarusians to be both proud of their countries and ashamed of their governments.Third point: In recent years, Putin has gone out of his way to castigate Woke Western culture for being censorious and repressive, not to mention hypocritical. “They’re now engaging in the cancel culture, even removing Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff from posters,” he complained last month. What the B.A.A. has done only validates the allegation.Fourth point: Americans are supposed to believe in openness, competition and fair play. We’re also supposed to believe that democratic societies never shine brighter than when they uphold these principles in the face of adversaries who flout them. It would be nice to see the B.A.A. celebrate those ideals.In “Animal House,” Otter defends his fellow Deltas by insisting, “You can’t hold a whole fraternity responsible for the behavior of a few sick, perverted individuals.” On this point, at least, let’s give Otter his due: You also don’t hold entire societies responsible for the behavior of their despotic leaders. The B.A.A. should think this one over and let the Russians and Belarusians compete under their countries’ flags for the hope of what their countries might someday become, free from the yoke of their present leaders.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

221,"KYIV, Ukraine — Thousands of people have been fleeing the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, escaping towns and villages under attack by Russian troops across the region. Many of them are from the city of Chernihiv, with bleak faces and crushing stories.They have been arriving in steady droves in recent days at Kyiv’s central station, clutching bags and children, their eyes hollow and full of strain.“The city is under fire all the time,” said Iryna Shepetova, 35, hugging one of her children after sleeping the night on a bench in the station. “The mayor told us you are responsible for your own lives.”She escaped with her three children and her mother on one of the last minibuses out of the city last week, as Russian forces closed in.Chernihiv guards the left bank of the Desna River and has been a target for Russian forces advancing on Kyiv since the start of the war five weeks ago. Thwarted from seizing control of Chernihiv, Russian units surrounded it and pounded it with airstrikes and artillery fire, as a second battalion group moved in to encircle it from the south.On Tuesday, in negotiations in Istanbul aimed at ending the war, the Russians said they would ease their bombardment of Chernihiv, but their positions around it are already so fortified, and the city itself so battered, that the offer hardly amounted to a concession at all.ImageThe Revenok family and friends who managed to escape Chernihiv, waiting to depart Kyiv for Lviv, from where they plan to travel to Europe. Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times“They were purposely bombing schools,” said Vera Kaydash, 67, a retired physician. “There were lines for bread and water and they fired on the people waiting.” She said she knew two people who were among those killed in an attack on a line outside a grocery store.Water and electricity were out, only gas was working on one side of town, and telephone and internet services were down, she said. In her former hospital, the damage had made the X-ray and dialysis departments unusable, she said. “They destroyed them in such a way that only after the war would we be able to replace them.”“I have not seen such cynical behavior in my life,” she said.So when the city’s mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, urged those who could to get out and volunteers from a private bus company organized minibuses, dozens of people decided to risk it. Cars trying to escape had come under repeated fire and there was no guarantee of safe passage for civilians, but the situation inside the city was becoming increasingly precarious.“A great number of cars came under fire and many people died,” said Dr. Kaydash’s husband, Mikhail, 68, who accompanied his wife and sister. He said he was surprised that they got through. “We were lucky, it was quiet.”They made a tortuous six-hour journey along back roads through woods and fields to avoid Russian positions, listening to the pounding of tank and mortar fire not far away.Ms. Shepetova left behind her husband since, she said, men between the ages of 18 and 60 were not allowed to board the buses. Dr. Kaydash left behind her daughter and family.Then three days after their escape, Russian planes bombed the only bridge leading out of Chernihiv, cutting the exit route for tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers still inside. There remains a pedestrian bridge across the river but it is damaged and exposed to Russian shelling and gunfire, the mayor said.He asked for help for his besieged city last weekend in a video call with journalists. “We are looking for way to bring 44 seriously wounded people out,” he said. “They need urgent evacuation.” The wounded were mostly military, he said, but included civilians and three children.More than 200 people had been killed in attacks on Chernihiv, he said, adding that destruction was so extensive, “it is now easier to count those buildings that have not been damaged.”ImageDima Neron, 19, from the Chernihiv region, was charging his phone from a generator, when Russian forces bombed his family’s farm in the village of Kulikovka on March 21st. He lost three fingers on his left hand, and his left leg was fractured in several places. Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesSince then, families have still been trickling out on increasingly dangerous journeys, making their way from the city on foot and ferried across the river by volunteers in small boats. Many are so terrified of the prospect of a Russian takeover that they did not want their full names published, but recounted their experiences.One family said they walked and drove for three days through villages before finding a way across the river. “We were a group of seven with one child and a grandmother who is disabled,” said Svetlana, 40. “We had to make a huge hook around, for 50 kilometers, with him,” she said pointing to her five-year-old son, Dyma. They loaded their bags onto two bicycles and pushed them along, she said.People described a chaotic and dangerous situation with front lines shifting as Russian forces sought to encircle the city and Ukrainian forces mounted a counterattack.“All the ways out of Chernihiv are being shot at by the Russians,” said Alyona Sukhova, who drove out with her husband and 14-year-old daughter, Olha, from a rural area south of the river on Monday. “It was risky,” said her husband, Pavlo Sukhov, who did the driving. “The Russians had been pushed back a bit so there was a small window to get out.”ImageA young woman who managed to escape Chernihiv arriving in Kyiv on Tuesday.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesAs fighting swirled around the city, ordinary civilians going about their work were caught up in incomprehensible shootings.Two women from Chernihiv were working as cooks in a factory in the nearby town of Sevchenkove when it was stormed by Russian troops. “The first day a woman and a man were shot in their car,” said one of the women, Alla, 44. “It was scary to go out at all.” They sheltered in the basement of their hostel and then a Russian tank fired point blank at the building.“They shot with tanks on our building,” said the other, Yulia, 55. “Thank God nothing fell on us.” The two women caught a ride in someone’s car and fled, but they were now homeless since they could not return to Chernihiv. Alla said her 17-year-old son was stuck there.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.On a road south of Chernihiv a mechanic, Vitaliy, 42, was fetching supplies of flour from a farm several weeks ago when he ran into a column of Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers advancing from the opposite direction.“It’s one in a million that I am alive,” he said, nursing a shattered arm and bandaged eye at a hospital on Kyiv’s left bank. “I got two bullets in my head,” he added, pulling up the hospital X-rays on his phone.ImageVitaliy, 42, was wounded when he pulled over to let a column of Russian tanks pass on a country road, and they opened fire on his car.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesWhen he saw the column he stopped his car, Vitaly said, and pulled off the road, but the Russian troops opened fire on his car so he ran into the field and lay down.“There was no cover and then they started shooting at me,” he said. Bullets were flying around him and until one shattered his arm and another pierced his eye, lodging in his brain. He remained conscious as the convoy passed and Ukrainian members of the territorial defense rescued him. “I thought the column would just go by,” he said simply.Dropped off at the central train station in Kyiv, the evacuees from Chernihiv sat exhausted on benches in the vaulted passenger halls, waiting for trains to safer destinations in central or western Ukraine. They expressed relief but also some resentment at those ignorant of the scale of the war in their city.“Kyiv is relatively safe,” Ms. Shepetova said, looking around. “But there are a lot of military forces and I would like to see them where they are needed.”Mr. Kaydash called for more international help, especially in stopping the Russian air attacks.“If Chernihiv falls, the Russians will come to Kyiv,” he said. “The Ukrainians are fighting furiously. It would be nice to have some support.”Mr. Kaydash listed the countries where Russia has seized territory over the last 30 years. “It began from Moldova and Georgia and continued in Ukraine,” he said. “And there is Poland next door. Ukraine might be not the end. It might continue.”ImageLesia Revenok, 41, and her two teenage children arrived at the train station in Kyiv on Tuesday after escaping from Chernihiv.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/chernihiv-kyiv-ukraine-russia.html
222,"One moment, they were packed onto the platforms at the Kramatorsk train station, hundreds of women, children and old people, heeding the pleas of Ukrainian officials imploring them to flee ahead of a feared Russian onslaught.The next moment, death rained from the air.At least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in a missile assault on Friday morning that left bodies and luggage scattered on the ground and turned the Kramatorsk station into the site of another atrocity in the six-week-old war.“There are just children!” one woman cried in a video from the aftermath.The missile struck as officials in Kramatorsk and other cities in eastern Ukraine had been warning civilians to leave before Russian forces mount what is expected to be a major push into the region, where their troops have been regrouping after withdrawing from areas around Kyiv, the capital.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that Russia had hit the station with what he identified as a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile as “thousands of peaceful Ukrainians were waiting to be evacuated.”ImageClearing out bodies after the rocket attack in Kramatorsk.Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Lacking the strength and courage to stand up to us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population,” Mr. Zelensky said. “This is an evil that has no limits. And if it is not punished, it will never stop.”Russian officials, denying responsibility, said a Ukrainian battalion had fired the missile in what they called a “provocation.” The Russian Defense Ministry said that Tochka-U missiles are only used by the Ukrainian armed forces and that Russian troops had not made any strikes against Kramatorsk on Friday.A senior Pentagon official said the United States believed Russian forces had fired the missile. “They originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential intelligence assessment.The train station was hit as a top European Union delegation was visiting Mr. Zelensky’s government, and the images of yet another mass killing provoked new Western outrage.Whether one or more missiles struck the station was not immediately clear, and there was no way to independently verify the origin of the attack. Several parked cars were also hit, catching fire and turning into charred hulks. The waiting area was strewn with bodies and belongings.After the strike, the Ukrainian police inspected the remains of a large rocket next to the train station with the words “for our children” written on it in Russian. It was unclear who had written the message and where the rocket had come from.The mayor of Kramatorsk, Oleksandr Honcharenko, said 4,000 people had been at the station when it was attacked, the vast majority of them women, children and elderly people. At least two children were among the dead, he said.The head of the military administration in the region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said 50 people had been killed, including 12 who died in the hospital. Another 98 were wounded, including 16 children, he said.After the attack, Kramatorsk officials said they were trying to find cars and buses to evacuate civilians to western areas presumed to be less vulnerable to Russian attacks.ImageA fragment of what Ukraine’s president described as a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile following an attack at the railway station in Kramatorsk.Credit...Andriy Andriyenko/Associated PressUkraine’s railway service said that evacuations would proceed from nearby Sloviansk, where shelters and hospitals have been stocked with food and medicine in anticipation of an imminent Russian offensive.Western countries, which have been shipping arms to Ukraine and tightening sanctions on Russia to punish President Vladimir V. Putin for the invasion, saw the Kramatorsk slaughter as new justification to intensify their efforts.“The attack on a Ukrainian train station is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia, striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety,” President Biden said on Twitter. He vowed to send more weapons to Ukraine and to work with allies to investigate the attack “as we document Russia’s actions and hold them accountable.”President Emmanuel Macron of France called the strike “abominable.”“Ukrainian civilians are fleeing to escape the worst,” he wrote on Twitter. “Their weapons? Strollers, stuffed animals, luggage.”The station was hit as the Slovak president, Eduard Heger, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, were traveling to Kyiv in a show of support for Mr. Zelensky and his country’s bid for European Union membership.Mr. Heger announced that Slovakia had given Ukraine an S-300 air defense system to help defend against Russian missiles and airstrikes.ImageA man hugs a woman in Kramatorsk after the strike.Credit...Andriy Andriyenko/Associated PressTo make the transfer possible, the Pentagon said it would reposition one Patriot missile system, operated by U.S. service members, to Slovakia. It was the latest buildup in arms and troops along NATO’s eastern flank, as the alliance seeks to deter any Russian incursion.“Now is no time for complacency,” Mr. Biden said in a statement announcing the Patriot repositioning. “As the Russian military repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to defend its country.”The attack on the railway station came after Russian forces had spent weeks shelling schools, hospitals and apartment buildings in an apparent attempt to pound Ukraine into submission by indiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure, ignoring Geneva Convention protections that can make such actions war crimes.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Last month, an estimated 300 people were killed in an attack on a theater where hundreds had been sheltering in the battered port of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said. In recent days, growing evidence has pointed to atrocities in the devastated suburbs of Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops found bodies bound and shot in the head after Russian forces had retreated.Ms. von der Leyen visited one of those suburbs, Bucha, on Friday before meeting with Mr. Zelensky.“It was important to start my visit in Bucha,” she wrote on Twitter. “Because in Bucha our humanity was shattered.”Russia has said its troops have been falsely accused and that the evidence against them is fake.The repercussions of the fighting are spreading far beyond Europe. The United Nations reported on Friday that world food prices rose sharply last month to their highest levels ever, as the invasion sent shock waves through global grain and vegetable oil markets. Russia and Ukraine are important suppliers of the world’s wheat and other grains.ImageDamaged cars outside the railway station in Kramatorsk.Credit...Andriy Andriyenko/Associated PressThe report of rising prices came as the British government said Russia was heading for its “deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union,” estimating that the economy could shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.On Friday, the European Union formally approved its fifth round of sanctions against Moscow, which included a ban on Russian coal and restrictions on Russian banks, oligarchs and Kremlin officials. The coal ban, which will cost Russia about $8.7 billion in annual revenue, takes effect immediately for new contracts. At Germany’s insistence, however, existing contracts were given four months to wind down, softening the blow to Russia and Germany alike.Nevertheless, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in London on Friday, applauded what Mr. Johnson called the “seismic decision” by Germany to turn away from Russian fuel. Britain has pushed for a total ban on Russian energy, a move that Germany, which heats half its homes with Russian gas, has resisted.Mr. Johnson acknowledged the obstacles to transforming Germany’s energy system “overnight,” but said “we know that Russia’s war in Ukraine will not end overnight.” Mr. Scholz said Mr. Putin had tried to divide European powers, but “he will continue to experience our unity.”On Friday, Russia retaliated for some of the punishments from the West, declaring 45 Polish Embassy and Consulate staff “persona non grata,” and ordering them to leave Russia. Poland had expelled the same number of Russian diplomats.Russia’s Justice Ministry also said it had revoked the registration of several prominent human rights groups in the country, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which have accused Russian troops of committing war crimes in Ukraine. The ministry accused the groups of violating an unspecified Russian law. The decision means the organizations are no longer allowed to operate in Russia.Human Rights Watch said that forcing its office to close would not change its determination to call out Russia’s turn to authoritarianism. The group said it had been monitoring abuses in Russia since the Soviet era.“We found ways of documenting human rights abuses then, and we will do so in the future,” it said.ImageAn unattended casualty at the Kramatorsk train station.Credit...Anatolii Stepanov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMegan Specia reported from Krakow, Poland, and Michael Levenson from New York.

223,"BRUSSELS — The race is on.As columns of Russian troops began pouring into Ukraine nearly two months ago, the United States and its allies started supplying Kyiv with weapons and equipment for what many expected to be a short war: sniper rifles, helmets, medical kits, encrypted communications, lots of bullets and the portable, shoulder-held Stinger and Javelin missiles that quickly became icons of the conflict.Defying the odds, Ukraine held on to its capital and pushed Russia from the north. Now, as the Kremlin switches gears and begins a concerted effort to capture eastern Ukraine, Washington and its allies are pivoting as well, scrambling to supply Ukraine with bigger and more advanced weapons to defend itself in a grinding war.The West is focused on sending longer-range weapons like howitzers, antiaircraft systems, anti-ship missiles, armed drones, armored trucks, personnel carriers and even tanks — the type of arms that President Biden said were tailored to stop “the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”ImageMilitary volunteers loading magazines with ammunition in February at a weapons storage facility in Fastiv, Ukraine.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times“The steady supply of weapons” has helped “ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said last week. “We cannot rest now.”Then, after a video call with allies on Tuesday, Mr. Biden told reporters that the United States would send more artillery to Ukraine. He is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in the coming days, according to a person briefed on his plans. The aid amount will be on par with the $800 million package of weapons and artillery that was announced last week, the person said.But the strategy comes with a notable risk: antagonizing Russia so much that it ignites a wider, international conflict.Russia recently sent a formal warning to the United States, saying that Western deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine could bring “unpredictable consequences.”American officials say the warning shows that the weapons being sent are making a big difference on the battlefield. So, for Washington at least, concerns about supplying arms that Russia might consider “escalatory” have ebbed — as has the initial worry that Ukraine will use longer-range weapons, like jet fighters, to attack Moscow itself and set off a bigger war.Officials in Washington are now grappling with how much intelligence to give the Ukrainians about bases inside Russia, given that the Ukrainians have already made small helicopter raids on Russian fuel depots. The White House has also held back on supplying some weapons that could strike Russian forces across the border, like rocket artillery, ground attack planes and medium range drones.Some argue the Americans are being too cautious.“Seven weeks ago, they were arguing over whether to give Stinger missiles — how silly does that seem now?” said retired Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe. “We have been deterred out of an exaggerated fear of what possibly could happen.”ImageA Ukrainian soldier looking at the remnants of a Russian T90 tank last month, that was said to have been destroyed using an American-made Javelin missile, at a frontline position in the northern region of Kyiv.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesAnxiety about provoking a wider war persists among some NATO allies, most visibly in Germany, which worries that supplying Marder infantry-fighting vehicles, considered one of the world’s best armored vehicles, could be perceived by Russia as making Berlin and NATO parties to the war.Robert Habeck, an influential minister in Germany’s new government, has said that supplying tanks would be an escalation and should be a matter of consensus within NATO and the European Union. “Heavy weapons are synonymous with tanks, and all NATO countries have so far ruled this out to not become targets themselves,” he said.But these are sovereign — not alliance — decisions, and Washington and numerous allies are shipping such weapons anyway, concentrating on supplying Soviet-era weapons that the Ukrainians know how to use, along with Western arms the Ukrainians can absorb fairly easily.Russia is striking Ukraine with abandon, complicating the flow of these newer weapons from Ukraine’s western borders with Poland, Romania and Slovakia to the battle in the east. That presents another risk: that Russian attacks could also stray across the Ukrainian border and hit NATO countries, “every inch” of which Mr. Biden has vowed to defend militarily.ImageA bomb-damaged bridge across the Irpin River on Sunday, in Bucha, Ukraine.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesHow this logistical race goes could well shape the outcome of the war.Russian forces, having suffered an embarrassing retreat from northern Ukraine and the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, are repositioning for what the Kremlin and Ukrainian officials call a pivotal offensive to take eastern Ukraine.Unlike many of the earlier battles, this one is expected to feature more tank battles on open ground, more long-range artillery and more weaponized drones.The Western effort is both sprawling and expensive, with as many as 30 countries, not all of them members of NATO. The push now is to get countries with Soviet-era tanks, artillery and perhaps even fighter planes to provide them to Ukraine, with the promise that the United States will replenish them with more modern, Western-made arms in return. There is an especially acute need for Soviet-bloc standard 152-millimeter howitzer shells, since NATO uses a different, 155-millimeter shell.ImageMembers of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps, firing a howitzer at a position in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine last month.Credit...Stanislav Yurchenko/ReutersThe United States has also agreed to provide some 155-millimeter howitzers, along with 40,000 matching rounds, while trying to buy Soviet-standard ammunition from countries that use it, including nations outside of Europe, like Afghanistan and even India, a longstanding buyer of Russian arms.But that is not enough, General Hodges argued. “We are still not thinking big,” he said. “We are still not thinking in terms of Ukraine winning.”Unlike the early part of the war, when many countries seemed to compete to announce what they were providing Ukraine, the current race is being run largely in secret.Much of the coordination, including how to get matériel into Ukraine, is being handled through the United States European Command, or Eucom, based in Stuttgart, Germany, and through a blandly named International Donors Coordination Center set up with the British.The command said that it established a “control center” to coordinate weapons and humanitarian assistance “from around the world” for Ukraine in early March. But it declined to discuss the details.The Pentagon gave a hint, saying that the State Department had authorized transfers to Ukraine of American-provided defensive equipment from more than 14 countries this year.But nations are trying not to advertise to Moscow exactly what is being provided. France says it has supplied 100 million euros of military equipment to Ukraine, without specifying what it has sent. Some countries have no desire to goad the Russian bear.A clear example was the confusion over reports that Poland had supplied more than 100 Soviet-era T-72 and T-55 tanks to Ukraine. Poland refuses to confirm any such shipment.Not all nations are being coy. The Czech government says it has supplied Ukraine with T-72 tanks and BMP-1 armored vehicles, while the Slovak government has made a big show of supplying a Soviet-era S-300 antiaircraft missile system.ImageUkrainians pulling an abandoned Russian tank from a field on Friday near the village of Lypivka, west of Kyiv.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesAs for Germany, part of the problem is that its own supply of working armor is so low that it has little to spare. Beyond that, learning to operate a modern British, American or German tank can take up to six months, while Ukrainian fighters would have little difficulty operating familiar Soviet-era armor.“We don’t really have time to get a lot of heavy American armor into Ukraine, and there isn’t time to train the Ukrainian military,” said Robert M. Gates, former U.S. defense secretary. “But there is a lot of former Soviet military equipment still in the arsenals of the East European states.”The United States, he said, “ought to be ransacking the arsenals” of former Warsaw Pact countries for armor and antiaircraft systems, “with a promise from the U.S. to backfill over time with our equipment to our NATO allies.”That is exactly what the United States is racing to do, Pentagon officials said, describing their own efforts to persuade the Slovaks to provide the S-300 missile system to Ukraine. On March 9, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III began speaking with their defense minister, Jaroslav Nad, and has agreed to send in Patriot batteries to replace it.Similar conversations are taking place with other allies that have Soviet-era weapons and ammunition, the officials said. The Americans say they are also speaking several times a day with their Ukrainian counterparts about what Ukraine wants and needs, and what Western countries think they can best provide.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivering a virtual address to Congress last month in the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center Congressional Auditorium.Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York TimesUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, repeatedly expresses gratitude for the aid but wants more, sooner. He admitted to being fed up with listing the same set of requirements over and over again to different national interlocutors, telling The Atlantic in Kyiv: “When some leaders ask me what weapons I need, I need a moment to calm myself, because I already told them the week before. It’s Groundhog Day. I feel like Bill Murray.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.There are also supply issues with Western weapons, like the older Stinger antiaircraft missile or the Javelin anti-tank missile.ImageArmed Ukrainian troops in a residential neighborhood of Kyiv last month.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesThe Pentagon has urged manufacturers to ramp up production. So far, some 7,000 Javelins have been given to Ukraine, about a third of the total American inventory, which will probably take three or four years to replace, wrote Mark F. Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Last week, the Pentagon met with leaders of eight large military contractors, like Raytheon Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation, to discuss how to overcome any supply problems — both to replenish American weapons stocks that have been drawn down to help Ukraine and to keep Kyiv in the fight. The two companies together make the Javelin, and Raytheon makes the Stinger.The United States alone has spent or allocated some $2.6 billion worth of such matériel since the war began on Feb. 24, and the European Union has provided 1.5 billion euros, or $1.6 billion. But there is no prospect of American or NATO troops going to the aid of Ukraine, officials say. The West is providing the weapons and intelligence — and cheerleading from behind.The known list of what has been provided already is long, and there is little doubt that supplies from NATO countries — and the training of Ukrainian forces after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, not to mention Ukraine’s tenacity and adaptability — have surprised the Russians, badly damaged their morale and extended the war.ImageUkrainian soldiers and foreign fighters conducting an operation late last month in Irpin.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesIn the months leading up to the war and afterward, the United States and its allies have sent Ukraine 25,000 antiaircraft weapons and 60,000 anti-tank weapons, including 10,000 provided by Washington, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress last week.The United States has also provided more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, 7,000 small arms, 75,000 sets of body armor and helmets, and night-vision goggles, encrypted radios, armored trucks and personnel carriers, largely drawn from pre-positioned U.S. military stockpiles, much of it in Europe, according to the latest public list from the Pentagon.Since the invasion, the Pentagon has cranked up its vast logistical and transportation network. Within four to six days after the White House approves a transfer of weapons from American military stockpiles, the Pentagon has been able to load the matériel onto cargo planes and fly it to about half a dozen staging bases in countries near Ukraine, chiefly Poland and Romania.From there, American officials say, the weapons and equipment are loaded onto hundreds of trucks and shipped into western Ukraine using a variety of overland routes. John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said it takes about 24 to 48 hours for the weapons to make their way from the staging areas into the hands of Ukrainian troops.ImageEmpty containers of German anti-tank weapons at a military base last month in Kyiv.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York Times“Eight to 10 flights a day are coming into the region, not just from the United States, but from other nations as well,” Mr. Kirby said. “That stuff isn’t sitting around.”Despite repeated threats to do so, the Russians have rarely tried to stop this flow of Western matériel into Ukraine. Pentagon officials say the Russians have been busy fighting in other parts of the country and fear Ukraine’s air defenses. “That flow still continues,” Mr. Kirby said.Britain, which has been more public about its contributions in the post-Brexit period, has supplied about $588 million of matériel, including anti-tank and anti-ship missiles and long-range artillery.Training the Ukrainians on new equipment in the middle of a war is a challenge, though. About a dozen Ukrainian soldiers were already training in the United States, and the Pentagon has taught them to use modern armed drones, like the 700 or so Switchblade drones that Washington is now providing.Military officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone,” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.ImageA Ukrainian fighter operating a drone last month in Irpin. Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesBigger armed drones, like American-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But Pentagon officials said the small, portable kamikaze drones could prove more cost-effective and elusive against Russian armored convoys.After the White House announced the latest $800 million tranche of weapons for Ukraine last week, Mr. Kirby said that American soldiers would train Ukrainian forces in neighboring countries to use some of the newer, more sophisticated equipment Washington is providing, like radar systems, as well as the 155-millimeter howitzers and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.“We’re aware of the clock, and we know time is not our friend,” he said.Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing from New York, John Ismay and Katie Rogers from Washington and Erika Solomon from Berlin.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/us-ukraine-weaponry.html
224,"Russia rejected calls for a cease-fire to allow for civilian evacuations in Ukraine on Tuesday, saying that requests to pause the fighting were not sincere and would only provide time to arm Ukrainian fighters.The rejection, delivered at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine, came just hours after the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, called for a four-day cease-fire to allow for evacuations in battle zones and safe corridors to bring in food and medicine.Civilians, including children, remain trapped in the eastern Ukraine region of Donbas, where Russia has begun a new and more fierce offensive, as well as in the devastated port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian defenders are making a last stand from the bunkers of a steel complex.Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, told the Security Council that calls for his country to establish humanitarian cease-fires were “insincere, and in practice they merely point to an aspiration to provide Kyiv nationalists breathing room to regroup and receive more drones, more antitank missiles and more MANPADS.” He was referring to man-portable air-defense systems, which are essentially highly mobile surface-to-air missiles.Earlier, Mr. Guterres had said that more than 12 million people in Ukraine now needed humanitarian assistance but that the number was expected to rise to 15.7 million, or about 40 percent of all Ukrainians remaining in the country. Millions have fled abroad, and many others are internally displaced.Even China, which has not condemned Russia and has abstained from votes on resolutions against it, said it supported a humanitarian cease-fire and called on Russia and Ukraine to move toward that goal.The reality gap between Russia and the majority of Security Council members and U.N. officials remained on display. Two U.N. officials and diplomats representing Eastern European countries hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees laid out the challenges of the situation, which Russia dismissed, saying that Ukraine had been plagued by migration of its citizens for years.Some statements from U.N. officials and diplomats on Tuesday spoke to growing frustration at their inability to broker a cease-fire, mediate a peace deal or convince Russia to end its aggression.“Colleagues, it appears that these meetings do not affect much either the security situation on the front line or the humanitarian situation in Ukraine,” Ukraine’s ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said.Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has veto power and has used it twice on resolutions focused on Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February. But even diplomatic attempts spearheaded by the U.N.’s top humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, who had traveled to Russia and Ukraine last week, failed.“So while we will continue our job to deliver aid, we need this council to do its job too,” said Kelly Clements, deputy high commissioner for U.N.’s refugee agency. “We therefore call on all of you in this council again — and yes, we are aware of the deep divisions — to put aside your differences and find a way to end this horrific and senseless war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/russia-ukraine-cease-fire-mariupol.html

227,"WASHINGTON — Russia is ambling toward a major default on its foreign debt, a grim milestone that it has not seen since the Bolshevik Revolution more than a century ago and one that raises the prospect of years of legal wrangling and a global hunt by bondholders for Russian assets.The looming default is the result of sanctions that have immobilized about half of Russia’s $640 billion of foreign currency reserves, straining the country’s ability to make bond repayments in the currency the debt was issued in — dollars. Girding for a default, Russia has already pre-emptively dismissed it as an “artificial” result of sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies, and it has threatened to contest such an outcome in court.The coming fight, which would probably pit Russia against big investors from around the world, raises murky questions over who gets to decide if a nation has actually defaulted in the rare case where sanctions have curbed a country’s ability to pay its debts.Russia does not appear likely to take the declaration of a default lightly. If that should occur, it would raise Russia’s cost of borrowing for years to come and effectively lock it out of international capital markets, weighing on an economy that is already expected to contract sharply this year. It would also be a stain on the economic stewardship of President Vladimir V. Putin that would underscore the costs Russia is incurring from its invasion of Ukraine.At stake for Russia, which has already suffered the abrupt rupture of decades of crucial business ties with the United States, Europe and other nations, is one of the underpinnings of economic growth: the ability to smoothly borrow money from outside its borders.Since Russia’s predicament is so unusual, it remains something of an open question who is the ultimate arbiter of a sovereign debt default.“This points to the squishiness and patchwork nature of sovereign debt markets,” said Tim Samples, a legal studies professor at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business and an expert on sovereign debt. “I think this is set to be convoluted and disputed for a variety of reasons.”Mr. Samples suggested that there could be a “cascade” of events that brings Russia to a default.The most direct verdict could come from the big credit ratings agencies, which have already signaled that Russia’s credit worthiness is eroding and that a default could be on the horizon.This past week, Moody’s warned that Russia’s payment of about $650 million of dollar-denominated debt in rubles on April 4 could be considered a default if it does not reverse course and pay in dollars by May 4, when a 30-day grace period concludes. That followed a similar warning earlier in the week by S&P Global, which placed Russia under a “selective default” rating.But it is not clear how the ratings agencies will weigh in if Russia fails to make payments after its grace periods run out because of European Union sanctions that have restricted the agencies from rating Russia. Spokesmen from Moody’s and S&P did not comment. A Fitch spokesman said he could not offer any comments on Russia’s creditworthiness in light of the sanctions.The Biden administration put additional pressure on Russia earlier this month when the Treasury Department started blocking Russia from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks. That new restriction was intended to force Russia to choose between draining the remaining dollar reserves it has in Russia or using new revenue (from natural gas payments, for example) to make bond payments and avoid defaulting on its debt.Russia can still make payments on Russian sovereign debt as long as it is not trying to use funds from Russian government accounts that are held in American financial institutions.After the grace period on the foreign currency bond payments expires on May 4, the next key moment will be May 25. That is when American bondholders will no longer be able to accept Russian debt payments under a temporary exemption that the Treasury Department has allowed.ImageThe Russian central bank’s offices in Moscow. A default would raise Russia’s cost of borrowing and effectively lock it out of international capital markets.Credit...The New York TimesWhile the verdict of the ratings agencies carries significant weight, bondholders will determine the consequences of Russia failing to make payments that were due or that violate the terms of its contracts. The bondholders could take a wait-and-see approach or declare that the bonds are immediately due and payable, which could cause other bonds with “cross default” provisions to also be in default.Another potential arbiter of default is the Credit Derivatives Determination Committee, which is a panel of investors in the market for default insurance, or credit-default swaps. The committee is deliberating whether Russia’s payments in rubles constitute a “failure to pay,” which would kick-start insurance payouts. The panel already ruled that the state-owned​​ Russian Railways JSC was in default for missing a bond interest payment.To some analysts, that decision and the payments in rubles mean that Russia already is technically in default.“If Russia doesn't pay on time, doesn't pay in the currency in the contract, that’s a default — it’s crystal clear,” said Timothy Ash, a senior sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “For all intents and purposes, Russia is already in default.”The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.Defaults have been tied up in courts before. Argentina notably defaulted in 2014 after negotiations with hedge funds that refused to accept reduced payments broke down and a federal judge in the United States ruled that it could not make its regular payments on bonds without also paying the hedge fund holdouts. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina’s appeal in the case.Russia’s case is unique because of the sanctions, and it is expected to argue that its ability to make payments in the currencies in its bond contracts has been constrained because it cannot access all of its reserves.Mr. Ash suggested that it would be difficult for Russia to find a court that is sympathetic with Russia’s position.“A U.S. court is never going to rule against O.F.A.C.,” Mr. Ash said, referring to U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers the sanctions.But Mr. Samples suggested that, given Russia’s global pariah status, creditors could struggle to pursue Russian assets even if they win a favorable judgment in court.He predicted that Russia would look for creative ways to avoid acknowledging a default, such as pointing to arcane language in bond contracts that could be interpreted to allow for payments in other currencies or by seeking a friendly court jurisdiction, perhaps in Russia.“I do expect them to stick to their own alternative facts,” Mr. Samples said.Despite the symbolism of a default, the economic implications for Russia and the world could be relatively small.Economists estimate that Russia’s total foreign public debt amounts to about $75 billion, while Russia’s annual energy sales are worth about $200 billion. Investors have been anticipating a default since late February, and policymakers have suggested that a default does not pose a threat to the stability of the financial system.Ultimately, the market will determine whether Russia is worthy of credit, and its actions in Ukraine and future sanctions will determine the fate of its economy.“It feels like garnish and a dressing on top of a very ugly and profound set of circumstances,” said Anna Gelpern, a Georgetown Law professor who specializes in sovereign debt. “They’re drinking from a fire hose as far as the energy revenues, so why do they need to borrow?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/business/russia-debt-default.html
228,"Russian troops had only started invading Ukraine when executives at Phillips auction house realized they had a problem.Public sentiment was building against Russian oligarchs and interests. Sanctions were being levied, assets frozen. Some collectors voiced concerns that Phillips was owned by two wealthy Russians who also control one of that country’s largest luxury retail companies, Mercury Group.“We had to make sure people realized what side we were on,” said Ed Dolman, executive chairman of Phillips, which does most of its business out of New York and London. “There were a lot of discussions that took place right across the company.”On Feb. 28, four days into the invasion, Phillips issued a statement online that condemned the war and featured the Ukrainian flag. Auction house executives were soon reassuring clients that the business was financially stable.Then, just hours before a big London evening sale of contemporary art on March 3, the company announced it would donate all of its earnings from the auction to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. By the end of the sale, this amounted to $7.7 million in fees.“They dodged the bullet right then,” said Josh Baer, a New York-based art adviser and commentator, who has negotiated sales through Phillips. “They got out in front of it with their remarks and their donation.”It is difficult, given the opacity of the art market and the constraints on excavating the financial details of private companies, to state with any certainty that Phillips has been left undamaged by the war and by calls from some to boycott its services. But that is what the company has declared, and that is what the publicly accessible metrics would seem to support, so far.At auctions in London this month, there was no sign that consignors or collectors had abandoned the company. On March 4, it recorded its largest ever total for a London day sale, and at a charity auction in London this week, all 15 lots were sold.At the London evening sale on March 3, five lots were withdrawn, but Phillips said financial, rather than political, considerations had prompted consignors to pull the lots from the auction, which took in $40 million.The works “did not elicit the interest we had hoped for, and as a result we advised the consignors to withdraw in advance,” Phillips said in an email.ImageLeonid Friedland, one of the owners of the Phillips auction house.Credit...David M. Benett/Getty Images for Phillips Auction HouseImageLeonid Strunin, who co-founded the Mercury Group, a luxury goods business, with Friedland and owns the auction house with him.Credit...Ekaterina Chesnokova/Sputnik, via Associated PressThe auction season is far from over, though. Coming up in a few weeks are the spring sales in New York, where the prices secured for the big-ticket items go a long way toward determining an auction house’s bottom line.Matthew Girling, the former chief executive of Bonhams, urged collectors to boycott Phillips, in an interview with The Art Newspaper, suggesting that only that “will get the attention of the world and the owners of Mercury to hopefully influence Putin to change his current chosen course of action.”A major collector, Andy Hall, agrees, despite having been called by a Phillips executive after he pointed out the company’s Russian ownership online. “I don’t think anyone should be doing business with Russia at the moment,” he said in an interview.“The art world loves to present itself as woke and politically in the right place,” he continued, “but here to my mind it’s complete hypocrisy that people are happy to keep on buying and selling art through this Russian-owned entity.”The British-Indian sculptor Anish Kapoor also weighed in. “Putin’s cronies are a legitimate target wherever they are,” he said in an email. “Phillips is as good a target as Chelsea football club,” he said, referring to a soccer team owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, whose assets were frozen this month by Britain. Abramovich is currently trying to sell the team.The two Russians who own Phillips, and control a business empire in Russia — Leonid Friedland and Leonid Strunin — are not on the same plane as Abramovich, though. They are very wealthy, collect art and have a large footprint in the Russian economy, but they are not viewed as politically influential oligarchs and have not been placed under sanctions. Phillips said its owners “have no political or business connection to the Russian government.” And they have now, with the statement posted on the company’s Instagram page, put themselves at odds with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.“We at Phillips unequivocally condemn the invasion of Ukraine,” the statement from Stephen Brooks, the company’s chief executive, said.“Along with the rest of the art world, we have been shocked and saddened by the tragic events unfolding in the region,” the statement continued.Dolman said the owners had insisted the company give away all its fees from the March 3 London auction as a donation to the Ukrainian Red Cross.Friedland now resides in Monaco and Strunin in Cyprus, according to British corporate records. But their business presence in Russia is expansive and high-profile. The Mercury Group, which they founded in 1993, is one of the largest distributors of high-end clothing, jewelry and other luxury goods in Russia, and it operates dozens of boutiques around the country. Their department store, TsUM, sits in the middle of downtown Moscow near the Bolshoi Theater.In auction season, the owners have been known to show up at sales and hang out in the wings, though it is unclear whether they will be present in New York on May 18 when the gavel first comes down at Phillips’s marquee sale of the year, the evening auction of 20th-century and contemporary art. Neither man responded to requests for an interview.ImageOne of the highlights of the auction season for Phillips this spring is expected to be a major painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, “Untitled,” which is estimated to sell for $70 million.Credit...Kate Green/Getty ImagesLeading that sale will be Jean-Michel Basquiat’s monumental 1982 painting of a horned devil, “Untitled,” which looks certain to achieve at least $70 million, courtesy of a third-party guarantee, which would make it the most expensive work Phillips has ever sold. The work’s consignment, by the Japanese billionaire collector Yusaku Maezawa, was announced on Feb. 28, four days after the Russian invasion, which the company cites as additional evidence of confidence from the art world.Dolman said there have been no major withdrawals from that sale but declined to be more specific. Phillips said that consignments, currently at about half of last year’s tally of 48, are still coming in. Already, projected total sales are expected to top the $118.2 million achieved at the same sale last year, according to the company.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine. The American conductor, a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years, has resigned from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov. Ukraine’s best-known living composer, Mr. Silvestrov made his way from his home in Kyiv to Berlin, where he is now sheltering. In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko. The superstar Russian soprano faced backlash in Russia after she tried to distance herself from President Vladimir V. Putin with a statement condemning the war. She had previously lost work in the West because of her past support for Mr. Putin.Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.The Phillips team, Dolman said, had not used financial inducements to keep consignors from withdrawing their works. “We’ve stuck to our standard conditions of sale and payments,” he said.But they have worked, he acknowledged, to distance the auction house and its owners from the war.“We’re obviously conscious of the fact that the whole world is aghast at Russia and what is going on,” Dolman said. “It would be easy to tar every Russian national with the same brush. It would condemn a whole nation to isolation.”“Phillips’s owners,” he added, “are appalled by the events.”A portion of the auction house’s durability during the crisis, some experts said, is based on the fact that many art-world denizens view Dolman and Brooks, who are both former senior Christie’s executives, and their team as the face of Phillips, not the Russians who own it.Peter Brant, a major collector who traveled this month to the Hungarian border to deliver supplies to Ukrainian refugees, said he does not support a boycott of Phillips. Though he hasn’t done much business there in recent years, he said he had a high opinion of the company’s staff.“If they are boycotting,” he said, “that will be difficult for them, but they are very resourceful people. They will do everything they can to counteract that.”The artist Ai Weiwei said in an email response to a question that he does not support boycotting “a private enterprise simply because it is owned by Russians.”“In fact, this kind of boycott is overbearing and bullying,” he said, adding that “its core is racism, discrimination, and political correctness.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/arts/design/phillips-auction-russians-war.html
229,"Just over a week ago, Joe Biden acted like Joe Biden and called the Russian campaign in Ukraine a “genocide” — leaping ahead of our major allies, our State Department and the available facts.The comment prompted head-shaking from people nervous about American escalation and praise from people seeking it (notably, the president of Ukraine). I am generally on the side of the nervous people: In a conflict with a nuclear power there is always an interest in reducing the existential stakes, and accusations of genocide should be made only with the clearest possible evidence, just as calls for regime change (Biden’s previous Bidenism, which had to be walked back) should be made, well, practically never.But unlike the talk of regime change, which the Kremlin takes seriously because it assumes the United States wants to plot a “color revolution” in Moscow itself, the accusation of genocide might seem to Vladimir Putin’s ears much more like a flourish than a threat. After all, there’s nothing in recent history to suggest that the term is used by Western powers with real consistency or certainty, or in a way that engenders a consistent American response.This is not for want of argument and effort. The experience of the 1990s, when America stood back from the massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda and then (eventually) intervened from the air to stop ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, seemed to yield templates for how the Pax Americana or the “rules-based international order” ought to work. When genocide was threatened, there was a responsibility to protect the endangered population. When genocide was determined to have taken place, there was a responsibility to place the responsible parties before an international court.But reality has not yielded to this idealistic framework. Instead we have cases, as in Iraq and Libya, where dictators were punished for either past or threatened atrocities — but they faced rough justice, not The Hague, and the American-led military interventions that toppled them were widely seen as unwise or disastrous. We have cases, as in Sudan’s Darfur region and now with the Rohingya in Myanmar, where the genocide label was affixed but there was no American military response. We have a case like the Second Congo War, where mass killings and atrocities went on for years without a determination of genocide — or, indeed, without much Western attention being paid at all.And then we have the recent case of China’s oppression of its Uyghur minority, which our State Department declared to be a genocide in early 2021 — a declaration that did not exactly lead to serious international consequences for the regime in Beijing.This last example is especially relevant for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in the sense that it answers a question raised by Biden’s genocide comment. If a nuclear-armed power commits crimes against humanity in territory that it controls, will the United States go to war to stop it? Go ask the Uyghurs. Or, for that matter, the Chechens, who certainly suffered as much from Russian cruelty as the Ukrainians, without anyone suggesting that we might risk a nuclear war for their sake.But this cold observation is not a counsel of despair. The idea of a lawbound, process-driven international approach to genocide or any war crime was always just a fantasy. But a more realistic calculus still leaves room to do what you can to make sure that mass murderers pay a price. You just have to tailor your approach and accept that you aren’t establishing a universal rule.Both the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, for instance, ended with the genocidaires suffering a devastating military defeat — but at the hands of rebel Rwandan and Croat armies, respectively, not United States or United Nations ground troops. The end of the Islamic State’s depredations, meanwhile, happened with U.S. military support, but with the Iraqi Army as a key actor on the ground.This suggests that where there is a plausible local military actor to lead the effort, international support can tip the scales against war criminals. Where there isn’t, sometimes you can play a longer game: Years after the Darfur genocide, the Sudanese dictator Omar Hassan al-Bashir may finally face an international tribunal after being toppled in a coup.But then, too, sometimes all you can do is bear witness. We weren’t going to invade the U.S.S.R. to avenge the Holodomor or put Mao Zedong on trial for the Great Leap Forward, and we shouldn’t expect to see Xi Jinping in the dock, either.The situation in Ukraine is its own distinctive case. It is very unlikely that Putin will fall from power; it would be insane for us to try to force regime change. At the same time, there is a military on the ground that’s proven capable of countering him, with international support but without direct U.S. intervention.And this good news, however provisional, seems like what our president should be stressing — the real situation, not the escalatory hypothetical.Is Putin committing genocide? Not yet, folks, and right now, with our support, the Ukrainians are making sure he doesn’t get the chance.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

230,"WARSAW — For the past seven weeks, Dr. Simona Neliubsiene has struggled to focus on her patients’ charts, distracted by images of bombed cities flashing in her head.At night, she lies awake in bed, her heart thumping, frantically doom-scrolling through the latest news about Russia’s war in Ukraine.“I never had anxiety attacks before,” said Dr. Neliubsiene, a family physician in Kaunas, Lithuania. “But after the first week of the war, I started thinking that maybe I should take some of the pills that I am prescribing to my patients.”Many Eastern Europeans feel intimately connected to the conflict in their region. Although the violence has not yet spilled outside Ukraine, some people in neighboring countries said they were making detailed war contingency plans — just in case. They complained that they were unable to escape the relentless news coverage.Some even said they were afraid to fall asleep.Their anxiety may be deeply rooted, and even prompted by generational trauma.ImageThe site of a mass grave in Bucha, Ukraine. For many in Eastern Europe, the news and images emerging from the war have been difficult to process.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesBecause of the proximity of the war in Ukraine, some Eastern Europeans are afraid of getting pulled into the fight. Images of the bloodshed only hundreds of miles away are dredging up painful memories of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers during World War II and the Soviet occupation in this part of the world years ago.And there are about four million Ukrainian refugees now in the region whose suffering is a constant reminder of how real — and how close — this war is.The images of atrocities attributed to Russian soldiers in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, pouring out of news media outlets, have only compounded these feelings.“When I saw those images, I was not able to move,” Dr. Neliubsiene said. “My family did not get supper that evening.”According to interviews with over a dozen mental health professionals and patients from Eastern Europe, there has been a surge in profound anxiety, as well as in requests for sleeping pills and calls to crisis hotlines.“This is a raw existential crisis,” said Sara Koszeg, a psychologist from Budapest, who started a project documenting people’s nightmares about the war. “And it has a biological effect: You are alert all the time, and this affects your sleep.”Katarzyna Skorzynska, 34, a fashion designer from Warsaw, said she kept waking up at 4 a.m., hours before she normally starts her day.ImageKatarzyna Skorzynska, a fashion designer from Warsaw, said she was having trouble sleeping because of the war in Ukraine. “My thoughts are racing,” she said.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times“I have been feeling overwhelmed and helpless,” she said. “Once I wake up, it is very difficult to fall back asleep. My thoughts are racing.”And it does not help that she starts her day by looking at the news. “Wake up, check on Zelensky, coffee: This has been my morning routine,” she said, referring to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, whose face has dominated Polish news media since the war began in February.Staying updated on the latest war developments has become a bit of an obsession for some, who hope that doing so will make them feel like they are more in control. But the reality is that it has had the exact opposite effect.Vytenis Deimantas, 29, a social scientist from Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital, said that he had trouble falling and staying asleep, but that even when he takes sleeping pills, he wakes up after only about five hours. Then, he rolls over, grabs his phone and scrolls through news websites. “There is a feeling of powerlessness,” he said. “And the more you think about it, the stronger it is.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Mr. Deimantas said he had never had trouble sleeping before, but now he lies awake worrying about the possibility of a nuclear strike — and of a nuclear cloud drifting over from Ukraine.These worries may have been passed down. After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the Communist authorities sent Mr. Deimantas’s father to the nuclear site to clean up and guard the area surrounding the damaged reactor. The episode has left a grave and long-lasting mark on his mental and physical health.ImageReactor No. 4 at Chernobyl, now tightly sealed. Vytenis Deimantas, whose father was forced to clean up the area near the 1986 disaster, said he often lies awake worrying about the possibility of nuclear war.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesOn the night that Russian forces took over the nuclear plant, at the start of the war, Mr. Deimantas kept obsessing about his bedroom windows, which he usually leaves open. “I kept thinking: If I don’t close them, what happens if the Russian army does something?” he said.Psychologists say that the challenge of anxiety is that people worry about things that are out of their control. And one of the most frequent symptoms of anxiety is insomnia.Dr. Neliubsiene has been swamped with requests from patients experiencing insomnia and anxiety. She has been prescribing them muscle relaxants for short-term use, and has been recommending physical activity, reduced screen time and fixed routines. One of her patients, a woman in her 50s, told her she was afraid to fall asleep. “She said, ‘What if Putin invades while I am sleeping?’” Dr. Neliubsiene recalled.Of course, many people have already been on tenterhooks for more than two years amid the coronavirus pandemic, psychologists said, making them all the more vulnerable to anxiety attacks in reaction to what is happening in Ukraine.“We are definitely getting many more phone calls,” said Tomasz Gorecki, a psychologist and the coordinator of Poland’s main crisis hotline.

Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.But even as helping those directly affected by the war diminishes feelings of powerlessness, it also brings people face to face with the refugees’ suffering — and exposes them to vicarious trauma.Ms. Skorzynska, the fashion designer from Warsaw, described a feeling of profound sadness after assisting refugees. “You genuinely realize that it could have been us,” she said. “That this is all happening just next door.”ImageA volunteer dressed as Winnie-the-Pooh last month at a train station in Warsaw.

Families in Poland and Lithuania said they discussed which art pieces were valuable enough to take with them and which routes would quickly get them to safer countries. And then there are those across Eastern Europe who have already witnessed the savageries of war.Dr. Irena Dziewonska, 82, a pediatrician living in Warsaw, said that one of her earliest memories was of hiding in a basement with her parents during World War II. As a young child, she said, she saw people being shot at and heard women being assaulted.Since the war began in Ukraine, all of those memories have come rushing back, Dr. Dziewonska said, and she has been struggling to sleep, eat or think of anything else.ImageDr. Irena Dziewonska, a pediatrician in Warsaw, said that the war in Ukraine had brought back traumatic memories of her childhood during World War II.Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times“This is just dreadful to have to experience this for the second time in a lifetime,” she said. Research suggests that trauma can be passed down generation to generation. Bodies retain physiological imprints of traumatic memories, which can be reactivated by stressful events.“I realized I can be afraid of things that my ancestors experienced,” said Dr. Neliubsiene, the Lithuanian physician. A member of her family was raped during World War II, she said, and she described “a terrible, gut-rotating feeling” when she saw news reports of Ukrainian women being sexually assaulted by Russian soldiers during this war.This personal experience of war has made the violence in Ukraine particularly vivid and painful across generations of Eastern Europeans.Whenever Dr. Dziewonska closes her eyes, she sees the burning Warsaw of her childhood.“I am trembling all the time,” she said. “I keep on thinking: They will come here again, and I will be in that basement again.”ImageThe Old Town in Warsaw.

231,"WARSAW — The symbolism was striking. On March 12, two weeks into Russia’s brutal bombardment of Ukraine, the leaders of France and Germany held a joint call with President Vladimir Putin. Just days later, three prime ministers from post-Communist Europe — Polish, Czech and Slovenian — traveled to Kyiv by train, despite the danger.This divergence exposed a sharp divide in how Eastern and Western NATO member states view the war in Ukraine. For Western countries, not least the United States, the conflict is a disaster for the people of Ukraine — but one whose biggest danger is that it might spill over the Ukrainian border, setting off a global conflict.For Central and Eastern European countries, it’s rather different. These neighbors of Russia tend to see the war not as a singular event but as a process. To these post-Soviet states, the invasion of Ukraine appears as a next step in a whole series of Russia’s nightmarish assaults on other countries, dating back to the ruthless attacks on Chechnya and the war with Georgia. To them, it seems foolhardy to assume Mr. Putin will stop at Ukraine. The danger is pressing and immediate.While the West believes it must prevent World War III, the East thinks that, whatever the name given to the conflict, the war against liberal democratic values, institutions and lifestyles has already started. Both positions have merit. But Mr. Biden’s visit to Poland on Friday, a day after an emergency NATO summit, is a vital opportunity to forge a common understanding. Both sides, West and East, must present a united front against Russian aggression. The alternative is disarray and destruction.At the root of the divide is history. Across centuries, Central and Eastern Europe have experienced the chilling effects of Russian imperialism. From czarist Russia to the Soviet Union, many countries through the region had their independence stamped out, their societies oppressed and their cultures marginalized. The trauma caused by the cyclical loss of territory and statehood is one of the most important elements of collective identity across the region.Many Central and Eastern Europeans share an anxious sense of themselves, a nervous sovereignty. Their independence, restored with such great effort after 1989, could easily be lost again, as the 20th century proved all too painfully. In the tragic fate of Ukraine, and earlier of Chechnya and Georgia, they see not only their own traumatic past but also their possible future. “We will be next” is the phrase on many lips.In this febrile atmosphere, NATO’s cautious steps look to many Central and Eastern Europeans like an echo of the phony war of 1939, when France and Britain undertook only limited military actions and did not save their eastern ally, Poland. At that time, too, horrible stories from bombed Warsaw and other cities filled the media. Yet the allies were determined not to be drawn in too deeply. Their military inaction temporarily delayed the spread of the war across the globe, but did not stop it.Whether the analogy is apt matters less than the fact that it expresses a deeply felt intuition about what might come next. That’s been visible in the way East and West have approached the war. Throughout, those geographically closer to Russia have urged a tough response. Now that Russia’s full brutality has been revealed, Western countries are weighing whether to impose more sanctions on Russia, send more weapons to Ukraine and intensify diplomatic efforts to end the war.But Eastern countries would prefer to go further still. Suggested measures in the region include imposing a no-fly zone — as President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly urged — or sending NATO troops across the Ukrainian border, even if only as a peace mission. The Polish government recently offered its MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, something Western allies considered a move too far.Yet Central and Eastern Europeans are convinced that they are right and have the moral high ground. They believe that they were correct all along with their warnings about the Nord Stream pipelines and Russia’s other geostrategic designs on Ukraine and former Soviet states. For a long time, such opinions were dismissed as Russophobic, irrelevant in comparison with the fruits of economic cooperation with Russia. Today these warnings seem horribly prescient.That doesn’t mean the region’s leaders ought to lapse into self-congratulation or even damn the “stupidity” of the West — as Czeslaw Milosz, the Nobel Prize-winning Polish émigré writer, called it — for its failures of foresight. The aim instead should be to communicate better with Western partners, something Mr. Zelensky, in his addresses across the world, has shown how to do.This is of utmost importance. One thing Mr. Putin wants is for NATO partners to be divided and at cross purposes, as the alliance was in its response to the Kremlin’s aggressive military actions in 2008 and 2014. Those acts returned partitions to the region, along with pro-Moscow puppet leaders, political kidnapping and forged elections. The invasion of Ukraine, as Eastern countries see it, is just the next attempt by Russia to upend the geopolitical order through territorial acquisition.Leaders in the region are in a unique position to spell out the stakes of Mr. Putin’s aggression and so help the West to better understand the level of risk. Yet the fact remains that Central and Eastern European countries would like to involve NATO in the conflict on a broader scale, while the West continues to prioritize global peace.It is a tragic dilemma. And far from approaching resolution, it seems to be just beginning.Karolina Wigura (@KarolinaWigura) is a board member of the Kultura Liberalna Foundation in Warsaw and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.

234,"WASHINGTON — The United States said on Wednesday that it had secretly removed malware from computer networks around the world in recent weeks, a step to pre-empt Russian cyberattacks and send a message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The move, made public by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, comes as U.S. officials warn that Russia could try to strike American critical infrastructure — including financial firms, pipelines and the electric grid — in response to the crushing sanctions that the United States has imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.The malware enabled the Russians to create “botnets” — networks of private computers that are infected with malicious software and controlled by the G.R.U., the intelligence arm of the Russian military. But it is unclear what the malware was intended to do, since it could be used for everything from surveillance to destructive attacks.An American official said on Wednesday that the United States did not want to wait to find out. Armed with secret court orders in the United States and the help of governments around the world, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. disconnected the networks from the G.R.U.’s own controllers.“Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” Mr. Garland said.The court orders allowed the F.B.I. to go into domestic corporate networks and remove the malware, sometimes without the company’s knowledge.President Biden has repeatedly said he would not put the U.S. military in direct conflict with the Russian military, a situation he has said could lead to World War III. That is why he refused to use the U.S. Air Force to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine or to permit the transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine from NATO air bases.But his hesitance does not appear to extend to cyberspace. The operation that was revealed on Wednesday showed a willingness to disarm the main intelligence unit of the Russian military from computer networks inside the United States and around the world. It is also the latest effort by the Biden administration to frustrate Russian actions by making them public before Moscow can strike.Even as the United States works to prevent Russian attacks, some American officials fear Mr. Putin may be biding his time in launching a major cyberoperation that could strike a blow at the American economy.Until now, American officials say, the primary Russian cyberactions have been directed at Ukraine — including “wiper” malware designed to cripple Ukrainian government offices and an attack on a European satellite system called Viasat. The details of the satellite attack, one of the first of its kind, are of particular concern to the Pentagon and American intelligence agencies, which fear it may have exposed vulnerabilities in critical communications systems that the Russians and others could exploit.The Biden administration has instructed critical infrastructure companies in the United States to prepare to fend off Russian cyberattacks, and intelligence officials in Britain have echoed those warnings. And while Russian hackers have sometimes preferred to quietly infiltrate networks and gather information, researchers said that recent malware activity in Ukraine demonstrated Russia’s increasing willingness to cause digital damage.“They are engaged in a cyberwar there that is pretty intense, but it is targeted,” said Tom Burt, a Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s efforts to counter major cyberattacks and shut down an attack in Ukraine during the opening of the war.Security experts suspect that Russia may be responsible for other cyberattacks that have occurred since the war began, including on Ukrainian communications services, although investigations into some of those attacks are ongoing.In January, as diplomats from the United States prepared to meet with their Russian counterparts in an attempt to avoid military conflict in Ukraine, Russian hackers already were putting the finishing touches on a new piece of destructive malware.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.The code was designed to delete data and render computer systems inoperable. In its wake, the malware left a note for victims, taunting them about losing information. Before U.S. and Russian representatives met for a final attempt at diplomacy, hackers had already begun using the malware to attack Ukrainian critical infrastructure, including government agencies responsible for food safety, finance and law enforcement.Adam Meyers, the senior vice president for intelligence at CrowdStrike, who analyzed the malware used in the January attacks and linked the group to Russia, said the group intended to cause damage and aid Russian military objectives.“It’s a relatively new group, clearly purpose-built with a disruptive capability in mind,” Mr. Meyers said. “The emergence of it is a progression of a continued demand from Russian forces for cyber operational support.”Another attack occurred on Feb. 24, the day that Russia invaded Ukraine, when hackers knocked Viasat offline. The attack flooded modems with malicious traffic and disrupted internet services for several thousand people in Ukraine and tens of thousands of other customers across Europe, Viasat said in a statement. The attack also spilled over into Germany, disrupting operations of wind turbines there.Viasat said that the hack remained under investigation by law enforcement, U.S. and international government officials and Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that it hired to look into the matter, and it did not attribute the attack to Russia or any other state-backed group.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.But senior U.S. officials said all evidence suggested Russia was responsible, and security researchers at SentinelOne said the malware used in the Viasat attack was similar to code that has been linked to the G.R.U. The United States has not formally named Russia as the source of the attack but is expected to do so as soon as several allies join in the analysis.In late March, a cyberattack again disrupted communications services in Ukraine. This time, the attack focused on Ukrtelecom, a telephone and internet service provider, knocking the company’s services offline for several hours. The attack was “an ongoing and intensifying nation-scale disruption to service, which is the most severe registered since the invasion by Russia,” according to NetBlocks, a group that tracks internet outages.Ukrainian officials believe that Russia was most likely responsible for the attack, which has not yet been traced to a particular hacking group.“Russia was interested in cutting off communication between armed forces, between our troops, and that was partially successful in the very beginning of the war,” said Victor Zhora, a top official at Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. Ukrainian officials said Russia had also been behind attempts to spread disinformation about a surrender.In the United States, officials fear similar cyberattacks could hit critical infrastructure companies. Some executives said they hoped the federal government would offer funding for cybersecurity.“I am perfectly well aware that if Russia as a nation-state decided it wanted to attack the national infrastructure of the U.S., including what I’m responsible for, I don’t have much chance of stopping them,” said Peter Fletcher, the information security officer for the San Jose Water Company, which is part of a group that manages water services in several states. “The entire Russian nation-state versus Peter? I’m going to lose.”Mr. Fletcher said that he was prepared but that smaller water companies than his own often struggled to keep up with cybersecurity demands. Many of them rely on outdated technology to pump and treat water, which could make them attractive hacking targets, he said.Community Electric Cooperative, a utility provider that serves about 12,000 customers in Virginia, estimated that it needed $50,000 to upgrade cybersecurity systems. The utility has already trained its staff on how to detect cyberattacks and has tested its systems, but representatives said the cooperative hoped to do even more in preparation for a potential cyberattack from Russia.“If we don’t have the capabilities to prevent this stuff and we are the grid, it could be quite detrimental,” said Jessica Parr, Community Electric Cooperative’s communications director.Despite the challenges, critical infrastructure providers said they were accustomed to handling disasters. “We deal with hurricanes and ice storms all year,” Ms. Parr said. “This is just a different type of storm.”Zach Montague contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/us-russia-malware-cyberattacks.html

236,"“After three decades of dominance, liberalism is losing its hold on Western minds,” Matthew Rose writes in his powerful new book, “A World After Liberalism.”Rose does not mean liberalism in the way we typically use the word. This is not about supporting universal health care or disagreeing with Justice Samuel Alito. Rose means liberalism as in the shared assumptions of the West: a belief in human dignity, universal rights, individual flourishing and the consent of the governed.That liberalism has been battered by financial crises, the climate crisis, checkered pandemic responses, right-wing populists and a rising China. It seems exhausted, ground down, defined by the contradictions and broken promises that follow victory rather than the creativity and aspiration that attend struggle.At least, it did. Ukraine’s refusal to bend the knee to Vladimir Putin has reminded the West that, for those who have not yet learned to take it for granted, life under liberalism is worth fighting for. But true renewal will require more than horror at Russia’s invasion or paeans to Ukraine’s courage. It will mean grappling with liberalism’s deficiencies and rediscovering its core radicalism.“A World After Liberalism” is a bracing place to begin this rediscovery, in part because so much of it takes place in liberalism’s era of ascendance, even as it came under violent threat. In the book, Rose profiles Oswald Spengler, Julius Evola, Francis Parker Yockey, Alain de Benoist and Samuel Francis, five thinkers of the 20th century far right who are experiencing a revival in today’s — increasingly near — right. Some of them reach into our world directly. To take one example, Evola, a not-quite-fascist Italian theorist, has been cited by Steve Bannon and was translated into Russian by Aleksandr Dugin, the philosopher and mystic now sometimes known as “Putin’s Rasputin.”The argument of the anti-liberals goes something like this: Our truest identities are rooted in the land in which we’re born and the kin among whom we’re raised. Our lives are given order and meaning because they are embedded in the larger structure and struggle of our people. Liberalism and, to some degree, Christianity have poisoned our cultural soil, setting us adrift in a world that prizes pleasure and derides tradition. Multiculturalism, in this telling, becomes a conservative ideal: We should celebrate the strength in cultural difference, reject the hollow universalist pieties of liberals and insist on the preservation of what sets people apart. The genius of this critique, as Rose writes, is that it recasts liberalism’s virtues into vices:In theory, liberalism protects individuals from unjust authority, allowing them to pursue fulfilling lives apart from government coercion. In reality, it severs deep bonds of belonging, leaving isolated individuals exposed to, and dependent on, the power of the state. In theory, liberalism proposes a neutral vision of human nature, cleansed of historical residues and free of ideological distortions. In reality, it promotes a bourgeois view of life, placing a higher value on acquisition than virtue. In theory, liberalism makes politics more peaceful by focusing on the mundane rather than the metaphysical. In reality, it makes political life chaotic by splintering communities into rival factions and parties.And yet the process runs in reverse, too. Both liberalism and Christianity become thrilling when described by their critics. Far from the technocratic slog of trade regulations and the deadening work of dragging laws past the filibuster, this liberalism is a marvel of imagination and ambition. It’s an ideology that believes human beings capable of new forms of social organization and a movement capable of untethering them from hierarchies so deeply embedded in our societies that they were thought to represent a natural, or even divine, order.Christianity, too, gleams with a light it often lacks in today’s politics, and even in its pews: Here is a religion that insists on the dignity of all people and centers the poor and the marginalized. Rose’s subjects fear Christianity because they fear it cannot be tamed; even when the leaders they admire try to subvert it for their own purposes, it infects their societies with a latent egalitarianism, setting a trap that will inevitably be sprung.Part of the book’s eerie relevance comes from the role Russia plays throughout. Spengler thought that the West was collapsing into incoherence and the next great cultural force might well emerge from a post-Bolshevik Russia. Yockey, one of the most egregious white supremacists in Rose’s menagerie, wrote in “anticipation of a resurgent Russia helping to correct a decadent West.” That is certainly the role Putin has claimed for himself, in speech after speech insisting on an identity rooted in soil and culture, on an imperialism justified by power and past, and on a conception of himself and Russia as lonely bulwarks fighting for traditional European culture.When Putin gives a wartime statement standing with J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, against cancellation by those seeking rights and recognition for transgender people, this is the serious argument lurking in the inane juxtaposition: Putin is trying to rally those yearning for the certainties of the past and offended by the constant instability of the liberal present. The logic that says Ukraine belongs to Russia now because it belonged to Russia then is close cousin to the logic that defends the social hierarchies of today on the basis of their power in the past. (Rowling, it should be said, wants nothing to do with Putin.)The misplaced shock that Putin would act as so many past leaders acted, that he would try to take what he wants just because he can, reflects liberalism’s long work remaking not just what we believe to be moral but what we believe to be normal. At its best and sometimes at its worst, liberalism makes the past into a truly foreign land, and that can turn those who still inhabit it into anachronisms in their own time. But liberals deceive themselves when they believe that that happens only to liberalism’s enemies. It also happens to liberalism’s would-be friends.You can see this clearly in “Ukraine in Histories and Stories,” a collection edited by Volodymyr Yermolenko. There’s a particular poignancy in reading this book now, as it was released in 2019, in the interregnum between Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its current invasion of Ukraine. This is the recent past, but it, too, feels foreign.In this collection of essays, written by Ukrainian intellectuals, Ukraine is not a darling of the West; it is a country that aspires to be part of the West and struggles against the indifference and even contempt of those it admires. Throughout the book, the West’s ignorance of Ukraine is a theme, with author after author recalling futile efforts to try to interest Europeans in their experience and history and possibilities. “We, Ukrainians, are in love with Europe, Europe is in love with Russia, while Russia hates both us and Europe,” the novelist Yuri Andrukhovych writes.The authors see Ukraine as a nation trapped painfully in a state of becoming, neither truly modern nor confidently traditionalist. Andrij Bondar, a Ukrainian essayist, offers a tragicomic list of what Ukraine lacks, including “trust in institutions,” “the culture of comic books,” “the Protestant work ethic” and “Calvados or any other apple spirits.” But there is also much it has, including “a generally highly tolerant society,” “the ability to consolidate and unite efforts to attain a common goal,” “elements of democracy” and “a talent for enduring hardship.” Today it is clear that these were the things that mattered.The authors also see that Europe is not all that it claimed to be. “For us, citizens of Ukraine, Europe still looks like the Europe of the late 20th century, while it has become absolutely different today,” writes Vakhtang Kebuladze, a Ukrainian philosopher. “I understand this, of course, and it hurts when I see the actions of Putin’s European right-wing and left-wing friends. I certainly do not like this Europe.”Prophetically, Kebuladze saw that Western renewal might lie in attending to the experience of those struggling toward liberalism, not those comfortably ensconced in it. “Europeans could look at themselves through the eyes of those citizens of Ukraine who came to Maidan for the sake of the European future of their country, those who are dying in the east of our country while protecting it from Russian invasion and those who are slowly dying in Russian prisons sent there on trumped-up charges,” he writes. “Will you then perhaps like yourselves? Or will you see a way to overcome something that you do not like?”The anti-liberals Rose profiles all believed that liberalism prescribed a life without sacrifice, an age when individual contentment reigned supreme and collective struggle disappeared. This was not true then, and it is not true now. What they missed is what liberalism actually believes: that there is a collective identity to be found in collective betterment, that making the future more just than the past is a mission as grand as any offered by antiquity.But a critique they make thrums through our present and should be taken seriously: Liberalism needs a healthier relationship to time. Can the past become a foreign country without those who still live there being turned into foreigners in their own land? If the future is to be unmapped, then how do we persuade those who fear it, or mistrust us, to agree to venture into its wilds?I suspect another way of asking the same question is this: Can the constant confrontation with our failures and deficiencies produce a culture that is generous and forgiving? Can it be concerned with those who feel not just left behind, as many in America do, but left out, as so many Ukrainians were for so long?The answer to that — if there is an answer to that — may lie in the Christianity the anti-liberals feared, which too few in politics practice. What I, as an outsider to Christianity, have always found most beautiful about it is how strange it is. Here is a worldview built on a foundation of universal sin and insufficiency, an equality that bleeds out of the recognition that we are all broken, rather than that we must all be great. I’ve always envied the practice of confession, not least for its recognition that there will always be more to confess and so there must always be more opportunities to be forgiven.You can see some of this spirit, in secular form, in the Ukrainian essays. The tone is anything but triumphalist, with Russia having taken Crimea and the rest of Europe and the United States shrugging it off. The perspective is largely tragic, cleareyed about the work that may go undone and the distance left to travel. But the writing is generous, too: suffused with love for country, honesty about an often bloody history, determination despite a disappointing present and, above all, a commitment to one another.There is much to learn from in that merger of self-criticism and deep solidarity.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

237,"VENICE — The 78 bronze funnels were ready, the pump tested and the backdrop was almost done. So when it looked as if war was most likely coming to Ukraine, Maria Lanko, one of the curators of the Ukrainian pavilion at the Venice Biennale, was determined to get the artist Pavlo Makov’s fountain sculpture safely out of the country.In a recent interview in New York, Lanko described how she loaded the funnels in three boxes and packed them into her car. “We expected something might start,” she said. “There was a lot of tension and Putin gave us many hints.”On the evening of the war’s first day, as explosions besieged the city, Lanko set off driving from Kyiv with her dog and a colleague, the pavilion’s art director, Sergiy Mishakin. “I started the journey without a precise route,” said Lanko. “I had to decide which road was safest.”So began a harrowing three-week journey — driving 10 hours a day on back roads, staying in places without heat — that ultimately took Lanko out of Ukraine and to Vienna, where the sculpture’s materials were sent onward to Italy.“It’s because of her that we are here now,” Makov said in an interview in Venice this month. “She took all these funnels and said, ‘We will do it anyway.’ And then we got to work and we did it,” he said.ImagePavlo Makov’s work “Fountain of Exhaustion,” which will be shown in the Ukrainian pavilion, consists of 78 funnels.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesImageWater will flow through the funnels, which are arranged in an an eight-foot pyramid.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesImageMakov, left, supervising the sculpture’s fabrication in Milan.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesIt wasn’t quite that simple: Seventy-eight funnels do not, on their own, make a fountain. They needed to be fitted with modern hydraulics, and there were restrictions on installing those in the historic Arsenale where the work will be shown. With only weeks to go before the Biennale opening, the curators had to find a company that could assemble the structure in time.Back in Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, where he lives, Makov had considered staying put. But after days of bombings — and concerned about his 92-year-old-mother, who refused to leave her fourth-floor walk-up downtown — he decided to get his family to safety.Makov; his wife; his mother; Tatiana Borzunova, the graphic designer of the pavilion’s catalog; her mother; and a cat all piled into his car, with only a few personal effects, choices dictated by the madness of the moment. “You open the drawers, and you think what will you take and you understand you don’t want to take anything,” he recalled. “I didn’t take anything. I left everything.”They, too, headed for Venice via Vienna, where a home was found for the mothers.Lanko, in the meantime, had found a company in Milan to create the fountain’s structure. It cost considerably more than she had budgeted, and she said the Biennale stepped up to pay for it.“Maria can go through the wall if she needs it,” Makov said.Image“Fountain of Exhaustion” is an updated version of a sculpture Makov made in 1995.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesImageWater streams into the top funnel, but by the time it has arrived at the lowest tier, the flow has slowed to a trickle.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesImage“There is no knowledge about Ukrainian culture and art in the world,” said Maria Lanko, one of the Ukrainian pavilion’s curators. “Being in places such as Venice, we can speak up.”Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York TimesThe structure arrived in Venice last week, just in time for the Biennale preview. The event opens to the public on Saturday, and runs through Nov. 27.The installation for the Ukrainian pavilion — titled “Fountain of Exhaustion” — is an updated version of a sculpture Makov made in 1995.It consists of an eight-foot pyramid of descending tiers of funnels, whose spouts feed water to the funnels below them. Water streams into the top funnel, but by the time it has arrived at the lowest tier, the flow has slowed to a trickle.Makov had the idea for the fountain in 1994, he said. He had been inspired by the local situation in Kharkiv in the first difficult years after the collapse of the Soviet Union: “There was this lack of willpower in the society, this lack of vitality,” he said, that the city’s fountains, which weren’t working at the time, seemed to manifest.The title of the work reflects “what I felt at the time,” he said.He made other versions over the years. One, exhibited at the National Gallery in Kyiv in 2003, was bought by the Pinchuk Art Center, a private museum in the city, and a huge version incorporating over 200 funnels was shown in Lviv, in western Ukraine, in 2017.With each iteration, its meaning broadened, to symbolize “the lack of vitality in Europe, and the exhaustion of humans in a democratic world,” Makov said.And the message has metamorphosed once again with the Biennale installation.ImageLanko and Makov in Milan on April 11. The finished work arrived in Venice last week, just in time for the Biennale preview.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times“It connects to Venice, because the city is in a state of exhaustion,” Makov said: Take away the tourist industry, “and there is nothing left.” This version was a, “tribute to the city. It may be sad, but it is honest.”The fragility of the watery city, engaged in a struggle against increasingly hostile elements, touches another chord, Makov said, “our exhaustion with our relationship with nature.”How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine. The American conductor, a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years, has resigned from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov. Ukraine’s best-known living composer, Mr. Silvestrov made his way from his home in Kyiv to Berlin, where he is now sheltering. In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko. The superstar Russian soprano faced backlash in Russia after she tried to distance herself from President Vladimir V. Putin with a statement condemning the war. She had previously lost work in the West because of her past support for Mr. Putin.Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.“Now we’re all concerned about the war, but three years ago, we were very much concerned about that fact that the ice is melting. And the ice is still melting, and in 10 years, it will still be melting,” he said. “We are failing to take responsibility for our relations with nature,” he said.Since arriving in Venice a month ago, Makov said he has taken on the unexpected role of national spokesman. “I don’t feel myself an artist here, I feel much more a citizen of Ukraine, and that it’s my duty that Ukraine is represented at the Biennale,” he said.Lanko said that this year’s Biennale was an important moment for Ukraine, the chance to showcase the country’s artistic talent and convey the message that a nation under siege can still make a creative contribution. “There is no knowledge about Ukrainian culture and art in the world,” she said. “It’s still considered to be part of the Russian cultural space. Being in places such as Venice, we can speak up with our art and our words.”At the Giardini, the gardens where most large nations have their Biennale pavilions, Lanko has also realized an open-air installation called “Piazza Ucraina” along with the other curators of the Ukrainian Pavilion, Borys Filonenko and Lizaveta German.The installation features a series of pillars that will be covered in posters, vetted by the curators, reflecting on the war. At the center, a mock-up of a monument covered by sandbags symbolizes Ukraine’s attempts to protect its heritage.Roberto Cicutto, the Biennale’s president, said in a statement that it was “a space dedicated to Ukrainian artists and their resistance to the aggression” that “will help raise awareness in the world against the war and all that comes with it.”Cecilia Alemani, curator of the Biennale’s main exhibition, said that throughout its 127-year existence, the event had “registered the shocks and revolutions of history like a seismographer. Our hope is that, with ‘Piazza Ucraina,’ we can create a platform of solidarity for the people of Ukraine in the earth of the Giardini.”As long as the war continues, so will uncertainty; Makov said he wasn’t sure of what comes next. After the Biennale opens on Saturday, “there’s no plans whatsoever, and I decided not even to think about it. I will see,” he said.Lanko said she hoped she could return to Kyiv soon. For now — even as she continues to worry about her family and friends back home — she is trying to focus on the positive: She made it to Venice with Makov’s work; the Ukrainian Pavilion will not stand empty. “I wake up, give myself an hour to cry, and then do things,” she said. “It was important to finally make it, despite the circumstances. Not everyone has the opportunity to leave Ukraine and to have a voice.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/arts/design/ukraine-pavilion-venice-biennale.html
238,"It was a remarkable moment in the war in Europe: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine gave a 90-minute-long Zoom interview on Sunday to four prominent journalists from Russia, the country invading his.Hours later, the Kremlin responded. A government statement notified the Russian news media “of the necessity to refrain from publishing this interview.”Journalists based outside Russia published it anyway. Those still inside Russia did not. The episode laid bare the extraordinary, and partly successful, efforts at censorship being undertaken in Russia by President Vladimir V. Putin’s government as his bloody invasion of Ukraine enters its second month, along with Mr. Zelensky’s attempts to circumvent that censorship and reach the public directly.In the interview, Mr. Zelensky offered a graphic description of what he claimed was the Kremlin’s disregard for both Ukrainian and Russian lives, to the point, he said, that the Russian army was slow to pick up the bodies of its fallen soldiers.“First they refused, then something else, then they proposed some sorts of bags to us,” Mr. Zelensky said, describing Ukraine’s efforts to hand over the bodies of Russian soldiers. “Listen, even when a dog or a cat dies, people don’t do this.”Mr. Zelensky generally speaks Ukrainian in public — his country’s official language — but he is a native Russian speaker, and he has repeatedly switched into Russian in the video addresses that he posts to social media, seeking to encourage Mr. Putin’s critics inside Russia. But Sunday’s interview marked the first time since the war began that Mr. Zelensky had spoken at length with Russian journalists, in their language.The journalists were Ivan Kolpakov, the editor of Meduza, a Russian-language news website based in Latvia; Vladimir Solovyov, a reporter for Kommersant, a Moscow-based daily newspaper; Mikhail Zygar, an independent Russian journalist who fled to Berlin after the war began; and Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor of the temporarily shuttered, independent television channel TV Rain, who had left Moscow for Tbilisi, Georgia.ImageIvan Kolpakov of Meduza, a Russian-language website based in Latvia.Credit...Janis Pipars for The New York TimesAfter they finished the interview, the journalists posted about it on social media, promising that they would soon publish it. Several hours after that, the Russian telecommunications regulator, Roskomnadzor, released a statement directing Russian news outlets not to publish the interview, and warning that an inquiry had been launched against the reporters involved to “determine their responsibility.”Even by the standards of contemporary Russia’s arbitrary law enforcement, the statement was remarkable, offering no legal pretext to justify the order not to publish the interview. But in the wake of the law signed by Mr. Putin early this month — potentially punishing news reporting on the Ukraine invasion that deviates from the Kremlin narrative with as much as 15 years in prison — the government directive had an impact.Novaya Gazeta, the independent newspaper whose editor, Dmitri A. Muratov, shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, decided not to publish the interview, even though Mr. Zygar asked a question on Mr. Muratov’s behalf. Unlike many other Russian journalists, Mr. Muratov has stayed in Russia and kept his newspaper operating despite the new law, even though that has meant using the Kremlin’s terminology of calling the war a “special military operation” and not an invasion.“We have been forced not to publish this interview,” Mr. Muratov said in a phone interview, noting that his newspaper was based in Russia and was under the jurisdiction of Russian law. “This is simply censorship in the time of the ‘special operation.’”ImageDmitri Muratov in the offices of Novaya Gazeta in October 2021.Credit...The New York TimesKommersant, as of early Monday in Moscow, also had not published the interview on its website; Mr. Solovyov did not respond to a request for comment. It was unclear whether he or his newspaper would face legal consequences for conducting the interview.But Mr. Kolpakov’s publication, Meduza, as well as Mr. Dzyadko and Mr. Zygar, all now based outside Russia, did publish it, both in text form and on YouTube. While the Meduza website is blocked in Russia, YouTube remains accessible. (Probably not for long, many analysts believe, with Facebook and Instagram having been blocked earlier this month.)Videos of the interview had been viewed more than a million times within a few hours of being published, offering a very different picture of the war to Russians than what they see daily on their televisions screens. Most independent news organizations have either been banned or forced into exile, while polls show that most Russians rely on state television for their news — in which the war in Ukraine is cast as a righteous crusade against extreme nationalism and necessary to pre-empt a threat emanating from an expanding NATO.“It was very important for us to speak, for him to be able to address the Russian audience,” Mr. Zygar said of Mr. Zelensky in a telephone interview from Berlin, citing the Kremlin propaganda tropes of Ukraine as overrun by Russia-hating Nazis. “For him, it appears, this also was important.”Even as the fighting continued, Ukraine and Russia on Sunday agreed to conduct a new round of negotiations this coming week in Istanbul. It will be the first time that senior officials from both countries meet in person in more than two weeks, after a series of long sessions conducted by video link in the interim.ImageDestruction in Kharkiv on Sunday. Russia and Ukraine agreed to another round of negotiations, even as heavy fighting continued in Ukraine. Credit...Chris Mcgrath/Getty ImagesWith Russian troops having failed to achieve a swift victory and seemingly bogged down, Mr. Zelensky is seeking a negotiated end to the war, without ceding Ukrainian sovereignty. But the two sides still appear to be far apart. He said in Sunday’s interview that Ukraine was not discussing two of Mr. Putin’s main, vaguely defined demands — the demilitarization and “de-Nazification” of Ukraine.He said that Ukraine would, however, be willing to discuss lifting restrictions on the Russian language and adopting a neutral geopolitical status. Any deal, he said, would need to be validated by a referendum to be held after Russian troops withdraw.He described a potential deal as including “security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state.”“We are ready to go for this,” he said.In the interview, Mr. Zelensky blamed Mr. Putin for manufacturing the enmity between Russia and Ukraine. He said the war would have the opposite effect of what Mr. Putin apparently planned — marking a definite split between the Russian and Ukrainian people, rather than somehow reuniting them.“This is not simply a war, this is much worse,” Mr. Zelensky said. “A global, historical, cultural split has happened over this month.”Mr. Zelensky’s descriptions of the violence of Russia’s invasion ran directly counter to the Kremlin narrative, which accuses Ukrainians of firing on their own cities and blames them for any civilian casualties and urban destruction. He said that the port city of Mariupol was “littered with corpses — no one is removing them — Russian soldiers and Ukrainian citizens.”He also accused the Russian government of forcibly taking more than 2,000 children from Mariupol, saying that “their location is unknown.” He said that he had told his officials that Ukraine would halt all negotiations with Russia “if they will steal our children.”Mr. Putin has received grossly exaggerated reports about the attitude of the Ukrainian people toward Russia and its government, Mr. Zelensky said.“They probably said that we are waiting for you here, smiling and with flowers,” he said, adding that the Russian government “does not see Ukraine as an independent state, but some kind of a product, a part of a bigger organism that the current Russian president sees himself as the head of.”After Meduza, Mr. Dzyadko and Mr. Zygar published the interview, the Russian prosecutor general’s office released its own threat. It said it would conduct a “legal assessment” of Mr. Zelensky’s statements and their publication, given “the context of mass anti-Russian propaganda and the regular placement of false information about the actions of the Russian Federation” in Ukraine.“It would be funny if it wasn’t tragic,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted to his account on Telegram, commenting on the Kremlin’s frantic censorship efforts. “This means that they are nervous. Perhaps they saw that their citizens are beginning to question the situation in their own country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/world/europe/russia-media-zelensky.html
239,"From “The Daily” newsletter: One big idea on the news, from the team that brings you “The Daily” podcast. You can sign up for the newsletter here.A year without war is rare. Armed conflict has been a consistent, present feature of roughly 92 percent of recorded history — with periods of peace few and far between.The majority of these modern wars, from Yemen to Ethiopia, go unnoticed by those who aren’t living through them. Few break into the collective consciousness, elevated by some delicate alchemy of political will and media attention. But when they do, the altruistic floodgates open, scattering money, time and in-kind donations in a thousand different directions.Ukraine is the current fixture of global philanthropic attention. The United States has approved billions of dollars in assistance for Ukrainian humanitarian relief. Pastries have been baked, lemonade has been sold and cryptocurrency has been transferred. Across the internet, celebrities are raising tens of millions of dollars, while fast-fashion retailers are hawking sweatshirts screen-printed with the Ukrainian flag. The intentions are noble, and much of the financing is going to organizations within Ukraine and across Eastern Europe scrambling to provide urgent relief. But what are the downstream implications of all of this attempted assistance?Providing humanitarian aid in the context of war is notoriously difficult. Conflict often inhibits access to those most in need, with humanitarian corridors tricky to negotiate and maintain. Local capacity for distributing assistance is often decimated by fighting. And injecting money into war zones has been shown to sometimes exacerbate conflict.Still, the suffering in Ukraine isn’t going to end anytime soon, unfortunately. Civilian casualties are part of Russia’s tactical, patient, brutal war strategy, as we explained on Thursday’s episode of The Daily. And more than 25 countries have offered expansive military aid to Ukraine, purchasing and delivering weapons to bolster the Ukrainian resistance in a war some presumed would be over quickly.So with this conflict likely to drag on, and with millions around the world wanting to help, we decided to call Peter Singer, the philosopher and ethicist best known for his work on “effective altruism” — the idea that individuals have a moral obligation to consider how to use the resources at their disposal to do the best for the most people. We wanted to ask him: What can an individual do to most effectively alleviate suffering in Ukraine? Mr. Singer’s answers below have been lightly edited.In Ukraine, the situation on the ground is changing rapidly, making it difficult to track the allocation of aid. Is effective altruism in the context of war possible?I’ve not seen a clear way in which one can give effectively for Ukraine unless you are living in one of the border nations. So if you’re in Poland, Hungary, Romania or Moldova, then you could do things to assist the refugees that are coming. You could take part as a citizen in welcoming those refugees and in trying to help them find places to stay or to get on their feet.There have been suggestions about donating to Red Cross or Médecins Sans Frontières, which are working in Ukraine for humanitarian purposes. It’s hard to know how much good that is doing. Very often we find after the event that, because of the chaos and confusion, the money was not always used so effectively.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.In addition to that, you know, there is the fact that there are people in great need elsewhere in the world that have been for a long time and still are. And we have organizations with well proven ways of saving lives or of helping to restore sight to people and helping them to get on their feet economically. And I still think that they are likely to offer better value than donating personally to humanitarian causes in Ukraine.The Ukrainian government has solicited cryptocurrency as a form of direct aid from the international public. What do you make of that?I don’t have any cryptocurrency. But if I did have a currency, I would not be thinking about giving it to the Ukrainian government at present.Boris Johnson [the British prime minister] just announced the increase in the amount of military aid. And Biden has given large sums of military aid. That’s hundreds of millions of dollars that are being given. Maybe if you’re a crypto billionaire, you could make a difference. But I don’t think the ordinary individual can really know that what they’re giving there is going to do something significant. But you can know that by giving to a whole variety of other groups, like the Against Malaria Foundation, that you’re doing good things with your money.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Are there other ways to support Ukraine?Citizens of democracy can be politically active. I think that’s very important. I don’t know that just donating money is what you should be thinking of, specifically in the context of Ukraine. You should certainly be thinking about supporting the sanctions and the strong action that the governments are taking, and supporting decisions to give military aid to Ukraine and supporting admitting refugees.I think there are things that we can be doing politically to indicate support for refugees. But in terms of giving money, maybe that’s not the best thing to be doing.Also, can you do something to help the opposition in Russia? Because really, that would be the best solution if somehow Russians could know the truth. Kelsey Piper [a writer at Vox] mentioned some places where you might be able to help independent media in Russia. You have to admire the bravery of Russians who are now facing years in prison for saying it’s a war, it’s an invasion, it’s not a special military operation.Are you hopeful that this emergency will have lasting implications for global openness to refugees?I’m skeptical that it will have global implications. There are various factors that people have talked about as to why many countries that are not very accepting of refugees in general are accepting of Ukrainian refugees. It’s partly that, you see the bullets flying and the bombs falling, and you know that this is completely genuine. These are not people trying to get to an economically better situation for themselves and their family. Second, of course, they’re culturally closer to the countries that are taking them. It’s not going to be so hard to assimilate them, to integrate them into the countries. Third, I guess the hope is that it’s temporary — that this will be over and they’ll want to go back. So I think there’s a whole lot of reasons we are accepting of Ukrainian refugees in a way that people are much less likely to be similarly accepting of refugees from other situations.You’ve written a lot about the moral and fiscal obligations of individuals in a world of finite resources. But attention is also a finite resource. Are there moral obligations in considering where we direct our attention?I do think that journalists should try to do more coverage of the neglected issues and the things that are going on all the time, that don’t make the headlines. I’d like to see obviously more positive stories about how organizations are effectively helping people in need because I think one of the problems of what is sometimes called “compassion fatigue” is really not knowing where you can do good. I’d like to see more of stories about organizations that are doing things well and, with relatively modest amounts of money, have made a big difference.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/podcasts/how-to-donate-to-ukraine.html
240,"HULIAIPOLE, Ukraine — The shelling begins in earnest a little before midnight, well after the sky has turned oily black, the cell towers have powered down and the stray dogs have begun barking into the night.There is no electricity or running water in Huliaipole. There is just darkness and long minutes of silence when the ticking of battery-powered wall clocks or the grating of open gates in the cold wind are anxiously scrutinized until the next explosion thuds somewhere nearby, rattling windows. And bones.And then it happens again. And again. A high-pitched screech and then a boom. Sometimes the shells get closer. Or farther away. Maybe, for a few hours, they stop altogether. But it’s been the same routine for almost a month in this town along the front lines in eastern Ukraine, with each night bringing the same question: Where will the next one land?ImageNatalia Vladimirovna was home when the house next door to hers was destroyed.“It’s like living in a horror movie,” said Ludmila Ivchenko, 64, between tears, bundled in her winter parka on Monday. She rocked back and forth, sitting beside the flame of an oil candle deep in the basement of the town’s hospital where she and her neighbors now live.As Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol are being torn apart by intense bombardments, cruise missile strikes and infantry advances, Huliaipole, a town once home to about 13,000 people, is dying a much slower death.The town, about 90 miles northwest of Mariupol and on the edge of the Donbas region, would likely be in the path of any future Russian offensives in the east, where the Russian defense ministry said Wednesday it would focus its operations.Strategically situated at the intersection of important roads bisecting the eastern part of the country, Huliaipole is surrounded by a half-moon of Russian and separatist forces that are perfectly content with shelling the town instead of taking it, likely because they don’t have the resources yet to do so, military analysts say.ImageLocal social workers waiting to receive food and aid to be distributed to the disabled in Huliaipole.The residents of the shrinking enclave — now down to about 2,000 people — are caught in the middle of dueling artillery battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces as homes, apartments, markets, restaurants and health clinics are slowly destroyed, and people are forced to flee, live underground or die.To the people still there, Huliaipole’s war began on March 2: the day the power went out. The water supply followed.Bracketed by rolling wheat and sunflower fields and bisected by the Haichur River, Huliaipole looks and feels like a Soviet-era staple: modest homes and low-slung apartment buildings with spacious tree-lined streets, perfect for an afternoon bicycle ride in another time.On March 5, Russian forces briefly entered the town before being pushed back. The collection of vacant half-destroyed stalls where people once sold vegetables and other goods is a strange reminder that this was once a real town. Now there is a patchwork of empty buildings with broken windows and missing roofs inhabited more by stray dogs than people.ImageStrategically situated at the intersection of important roads, Huliaipole is surrounded by a half-moon of Russian and separatist forces that are perfectly content with shelling the town instead of taking it altogether.Around a dozen civilians have died from the fighting, local officials said, a number that includes people who have suffered heart attacks during the siege.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.“There is shelling every day,” said Tetiana Plysenko, 61, a teacher in Huliaipole.Every morning, people emerge from their homes and shelters to assess the damages and call their neighbors to make sure they are still alive. Rumors are rampant, as is misinformation. One rumor is that a local was caught helping mark targets for the Russian military and was subsequently hanged. No one can really say if it was true, or not.“We still can’t understand that this has happened to us. We think that we’ll go out tomorrow and everything will be as before,” Ms. Ivchenko said from her basement shelter. “But there is no way to go back.”ImageA woman at a shelter in Huliaipole. There is no electricity or running water in the town.For now, Huliaipole is patrolled by a small contingent of Ukrainian territorial defense soldiers. The job of evacuating people, and bringing in humanitarian aid, falls to the 10 or so people on the Town Council. They have repurposed the town’s school buses to bring in food and water and take out people desperate to escape the shelling.Sergiy Brovko, 57, a short, wiry bus driver whose crow's feet wrap around the side of his head, had been ferrying children to school for less than a year before the war reached the town. Now Mr. Brovko drives his aging Isuzu bus to the city of Zaporizhzhya and loads up humanitarian aid: boxes of bread, cans of goulash and water. Then, he makes the hourslong trek back to Huliaipole.Image“There is shelling every day,” said Tetiana Plysenko, 61, a teacher.“I could never have imagined this,” Mr. Brovko said on Monday, as he headed toward Huliaipole on his seventh run there since the war began. He maneuvered his bus over the potholed roads common in Ukraine’s more rural reaches, downshifting to almost a standstill to navigate the larger craters left by overuse and disrepair.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“Not even in my nightmares.”The road from Zaporizhzhya into Huliaipole begins somewhat normally, aside from the military checkpoints and cement road barriers. But the posters throughout the city are a peculiar mix of things, signaling what life had been like in the city not long ago and what now lies beyond Zaporizhzhya’s gates: Between concert announcements and McDonald’s arches are billboards informing passers-by which part of a Russian tank to target with a Molotov cocktail.Image Huliaipole has repurposed the town’s school buses to bring in food and water and take out people desperate to escape the shelling.As Mr. Brovko gets closer to Huliaipole, the traffic thins out. Small towns along the road seem eerily closed, almost like abandoned movie sets. Ukrainian checkpoints are manned by young and old men. Newly dug trench lines zigzag away from the road, fortified by freshly cut logs and machine gun positions. By the time Huliaipole comes into view, Mr. Brovko has passed several recently planted signs that declare: MINES.“I evacuated my parents yesterday,” he explained, pointing out that a house on their street had recently been hit by artillery fire. Just days ago, he said, he had to wait to enter Huliaipole, his bus loaded with nearly 500 pounds of potatoes, until the Russians finished shelling it.On Monday night, Mr. Brovko parked his bus on the outskirts of town, riding his bicycle back to his father-in-law’s house, where he would spend the night before loading his bus with evacuees the next morning. His neighbors had fled a week earlier, leaving their puppy behind, so the school bus driver-turned-evacuee-transporter-turned-dog sitter fed the animal some bread before setting his alarm for 5:45 a.m. and going to sleep.ImageSergiy Brovko, 57, a school bus driver, at his neighbor’s home that was damaged by a bomb the night before. Tuesday’s sunrise was bitterly cold. The shelling had stopped around four in the morning, rolling off into the distance to some other frontline hot spot. Boxes of milk, water, bread and other goods were unloaded off Mr. Brovko’s bus to a collection of volunteers, before he drove a few blocks to pick up the day’s tranche of evacuees.The 40 or so people would all be driven to Zaporizhzhya, where they would register as displaced people. Some would be housed in school dormitories and gymnasiums or with friends and family. Others would leave the country. More than four million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 and 6.5 million have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations refugee agency.Of the roughly dozen people who boarded Mr. Brovko’s school bus, mostly women and children, their reasons for leaving Huliaipole were similar: The shelling was getting worse, and coming closer. It was too much.ImageValia, 60, with her granddaughter Lera, right, as they leave town.They quietly stepped onto the yellow school bus on Tuesday, some in tears. One woman said goodbye to her small toffee-colored dog, Asya, as evacuees are not allowed to take pets with them. Another woman, Valia, 60, was taking her granddaughter to reunite with the girl’s father before leaving southern Ukraine. When the granddaughter asked where they would live, the grandmother told a lie to reassure her.“To Dubai,” said Valia, who declined to give her last name. “The sea is turquoise there.”Not long after the buses left Huliaipole, the shelling resumed and lasted throughout the day, said Kostiantyn Kopyl, 45, a surgeon in the hospital and a member of the local territorial defense unit. Ukrainian forces fired back at night, and those remaining in the town did what they did every night: listened and waited for the next explosion.“Everybody’s alive,” he reported.ImageHomes, apartments, markets, restaurants and health clinics are slowly being destroyed, and people are forced to flee, live underground or die.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/world/europe/ukraine-front-lines-russia-war.html
241,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.This weekend’s edition of The New York Times Magazine isn’t the first to be almost entirely devoted to a single article, but it may be the fastest one that has ever come together.Jake Silverstein, the magazine’s editor in chief, wanted to address the war in Ukraine in a manner that had impact. “We just needed to figure out a way to cover it,” said Kathy Ryan, the magazine’s photo director.The team landed on “Citizens of Kyiv,” a 34-page photo essay that showcases about two dozen of the ordinary people — bakers, doctors, playwrights, students — who continue to live in Kyiv amid the frequent bombings by Russian forces. The feature was published online earlier this month and appears on the cover of this weekend’s magazine. The effort spanned four countries and multiple cities, and included contributions from about a dozen people, including a photographer, a reporter, translators, photo editors, designers and magazine editors. It was produced in just under two weeks.Ms. Ryan and Shannon Simon, a contributing photo editor for The Times, reached out to Alexander Chekmenev, a renowned Ukrainian portrait photographer who for many decades has been documenting life in Kyiv, where he has lived since 1997. His intimate knowledge of the city and its people was invaluable.Within hours of accepting the assignment on Saturday, March 5, Mr. Chekmenev was on the streets of Kyiv capturing photographs.While he wandered the city, seeking out portrait subjects, Anna Pechenina, who served as his translator (for communication with his English-speaking editors) and fixer — a local who assists a journalist in arranging a story — was making phone calls from Romania, where she had fled after the invasion. She was lining up portraits with people whose perspectives they wanted to represent, like a young, single mother and her 2-year-old son.One of the biggest challenges was access. Ukraine is divided into two parts: the Left Bank, which sits east of the Dnieper River, and the Right Bank, which sits west of it. Kyiv is on both sides of the Dnieper, and Mr. Chekmenev wanted to photograph people on both banks, which took planning. He also had to navigate the city’s 8 p.m. curfew.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.But even before nightfall, few people were on the streets. Amid the air raids, many were sheltering underground in basements, bomb shelters or the subway, venturing out only a few minutes a day to get food and supplies.After taking their photographs, Mr. Chekmenev took down people’s phone numbers and sent them to C.J. Chivers, a staff writer for the magazine, who wrote the feature’s text. Mr. Chivers followed up with the photo subjects in conference phone calls from his house in New England — with the aid of Ali Kinsella, a translator fluent in Ukrainian, in Chicago — to conduct interviews. Mr. Chivers did around 20 interviews over just a few days, chasing the last person up until hours before the final deadline.Mr. Chivers, who had previously spent time in Kyiv when he worked in The Times’s Moscow bureau, said he “drew from many memories” for the article. “I hoped to show a people whose futures and whose safety were under grave threat, as they adapted, one way or another, to a war they did not choose,” he said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Ms. Simon, who shepherded operations from Connecticut — often at 3 a.m. Eastern time, given the six-hour time difference from Ukraine — and Ms. Ryan selected and edited the portraits. Ms. Ryan said that Mr. Chekmenev “brought a powerful sense of seeing the landscape of the face” and used lighting to emphasize the emotions of those he was photographing: The photos are lightest around the subject’s face and fade to darkness near the edges of the frames, offering just glimpses of each person’s surroundings.“A lot of it was about wanting to be sure that you felt like you were connected to them through that photo,” Ms. Simon said.On the magazine’s cover is Anna Malinina, 30, a private English tutor for children who took up residence in a subway station. Hers is just one of the many stories “Citizens of Kyiv” tells. “I’m proud to be able to put ordinary people on the cover of such a big magazine,” said Mr. Chekmenev, who has continued to photograph those who have remained in Kyiv. “Honestly, they all deserve to be on the cover. There’s no one here who’s not worth hearing from right now.”Citizens of KyivPortraits of fortitude, desperation and resolve in a city under attack.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/insider/one-story-filled-almost-the-entire-magazine-it-came-together-in-two-weeks.html
242,"Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva whose international career recently fell apart because of her past support of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, sought to distance herself from him Wednesday, saying they had only met a few times.Since the war started, Ms. Netrebko’s performances at the Metropolitan Opera — where she has sung for 20 years, becoming its reigning prima donna — have been canceled indefinitely. Other leading opera houses, including in Munich and in Zurich, also scrapped upcoming performances. On Wednesday, in what seemed an attempt at orchestrating a comeback, Ms. Netrebko issued a statement distancing herself from Mr. Putin in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“I am not a member of any political party nor am I allied with any leader of Russia,” Ms. Netrebko said in the statement, which was posted on social media.Ms. Netrebko wrote that “I expressly condemn the war on Ukraine and my thoughts are with the victims of this war and their families,” but did not explicitly criticize Mr. Putin, and did not directly address her previous record of support for him.“I acknowledge and regret that past actions or statements of mine could have been misinterpreted,” said Ms. Netrebko, who once endorsed Mr. Putin’s re-election and has over the years offered support for his leadership. In 2014, she was photographed holding a flag used by Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine.“In fact, I have met President Putin only a handful of times in my entire life, most notably on the occasion of receiving awards in recognition of my art or at the Olympics opening ceremony,” she wrote. “I have otherwise never received any financial support from the Russian Government, and live and am a tax resident in Austria.”ImageMs. Netrebko said that she had only met Mr. Putin a handful of times, including in 2008, when he presented her with an honor. Credit...Dmitry Lovetsky/Associated PressThe collapse of the career of Ms. Netrebko, one of the biggest stars in opera, has been one of the performing arts’ most visible consequences of Mr. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine late last month.Ms. Netrebko is one of a handful of Russian artists with ties to Mr. Putin who have seen their international engagements dry up since the invasion. Valery Gergiev, a Russian conductor and a longtime friend and close supporter of Mr. Putin, was fired as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic earlier this month and has been barred at many concert halls and festivals outside Russia.In her statement, Ms. Netrebko said that she planned to resume performing in late May in Europe. In an Instagram post earlier this week showing pictures of herself in the desert, she wrote: “Soon I will be back to work. Not really missing it, to be honest.”The Metropolitan Opera, which has put in place a policy of not engaging performers or institutions that voice support for Mr. Putin, even as it continues to perform Russian repertory and present Russian artists, said Ms. Netrebko’s new statement was not enough.“We’re not prepared to change our position,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said in a statement. “If Anna demonstrates that she has truly and completely disassociated herself from Putin over the long term, I would be willing to have a conversation.”Representatives from the Bavarian State Opera in Munich and the Zurich Opera did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Alexander Neef, the director of the Paris Opera, where Ms. Netrebko is scheduled to appear later this year in a production of Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino,” said in a statement that the opera was evaluating the situation.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine.

The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.At a news conference on Wednesday, before Ms. Netrebko issued her statement, Mr. Neef said that the opera house would not feature artists who have shown “clear support for the actions of the current regime in Russia.”At the outset of the invasion, Ms. Netrebko posted statements critical of the war, but she also said she did not believe it was right to force artists to voice political opinions and “denounce their homeland.” At one point, she shared a text that used an expletive in reference to her Western critics, and said they were “as evil as blind aggressors.” She remained silent about Mr. Putin.In her statement on Wednesday, Ms. Netrebko reiterated her opposition to the war. She added, “I love my homeland of Russia and only seek peace and unity through my art.”On Friday, Mr. Putin lashed out at Western leaders for what he described as a campaign to cancel Russian culture and history, saying that composers like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff were being removed from programs, even though the vast majority of orchestras and opera houses in the West have continued to prominently feature Russian works and artists.

243,"Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, took an unusual step last week: It suspended some of the quality controls that ensure that posts from users in Russia, Ukraine and other Eastern European countries meet its rules.Under the change, Meta temporarily stopped tracking whether its workers who monitor Facebook and Instagram posts from those areas were accurately enforcing its content guidelines, six people with knowledge of the situation said. That’s because the workers could not keep up with shifting rules about what kinds of posts were allowed about the war in Ukraine, they said.Meta has made more than half a dozen content policy revisions since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. The company has permitted posts about the conflict that it would normally have taken down — including some calling for the death of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and violence against Russian soldiers — before changing its mind or drawing up new guidelines, the people said.The result has been internal confusion, especially among the content moderators who patrol Facebook and Instagram for text and images with gore, hate speech and incitements to violence. Meta has sometimes shifted its rules on a daily basis, causing whiplash, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The bewilderment over the content guidelines is just one way that Meta has been roiled by the war in Ukraine. The company has also contended with pressure from Russian and Ukrainian authorities over the information battle about the conflict. And internally, it has dealt with discontent about its decisions, including from Russian employees concerned for their safety and Ukrainian workers who want the company to be tougher on Kremlin-affiliated organizations online, three people said.Meta has weathered international strife before — including the genocide of a Muslim minority in Myanmar last decade and skirmishes between India and Pakistan — with varying degrees of success. Now the largest conflict on the European continent since World War II has become a litmus test of whether the company has learned to police its platforms during major global crises — and so far, it appears to remain a work in progress.“All the ingredients of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have been around for a long time: the calls for violence, the disinformation, the propaganda from state media,” said David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a former special rapporteur to the United Nations. “What I find mystifying was that they didn’t have a game plan to deal with it.”Dani Lever, a Meta spokeswoman, declined to directly address how the company was handling content decisions and employee concerns during the war.After Russia invaded Ukraine, Meta said it had established a round-the-clock special operations team staffed by employees who are native Russian and Ukrainian speakers. It also updated its products to aid civilians in the war, including features that direct Ukrainians toward reliable, verified information to locate housing and refugee assistance.Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, have been directly involved in the response to the war, said two people with knowledge of the efforts. But as Mr. Zuckerberg focuses on transforming Meta into a company that will lead the digital worlds of the so-called metaverse, many responsibilities around the conflict have fallen — at least publicly — to Nick Clegg, the president for global affairs.ImageNick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs, said in an internal post that the company was ending its allowance on calls for the death of heads of state.Credit...Hugo Amaral/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesLast month, Mr. Clegg announced that Meta would restrict access within the European Union to the pages of Russia Today and Sputnik, which are Russian state-controlled media, after requests by Ukraine and other European governments. Russia retaliated by cutting off access to Facebook inside the country, claiming the company discriminated against Russian media, and then blocking Instagram.This month, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine praised Meta for moving quickly to limit Russian war propaganda on its platforms. Meta also acted rapidly to remove an edited “deepfake” video from its platforms that falsely featured Mr. Zelensky yielding to Russian forces. The company has made high-profile mistakes as well. It permitted a group called the Ukrainian Legion to run ads on its platforms this month to recruit “foreigners” for the Ukrainian Army, a violation of international laws. It later removed the ads — which were shown to people in the United States, Ireland, Germany and elsewhere — because the group may have misrepresented ties to the Ukrainian government, according to Meta.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Internally, Meta had also started changing its content policies to deal with the fast-moving nature of posts about the war. The company has long forbidden posts that might incite violence. But on Feb. 26, two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Meta informed its content moderators — who are typically contractors — that it would allow calls for the death of Mr. Putin and “calls for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion,” according to the policy changes, which were reviewed by The New York Times.This month, Reuters reported on Meta’s shifts with a headline that suggested that posts calling for violence against all Russians would be tolerated. In response, Russian authorities labeled Meta’s activities “extremist.”Shortly thereafter, Meta reversed course and said it would not let its users call for the deaths of heads of state.“Circumstances in Ukraine are fast moving,” Mr. Clegg wrote in an internal memo that was reviewed by The Times and first reported by Bloomberg. “We try to think through all the consequences, and we keep our guidance under constant review because the context is always evolving.”Meta amended other policies. This month, it made a temporary exception to its hate speech guidelines so users could post about the “removal of Russians” and “explicit exclusion against Russians” in 12 Eastern European countries, according to internal documents. But within a week, Meta tweaked the rule to note that it should be applied only to users in Ukraine.The constant adjustments left moderators who oversee users in Central and Eastern European countries confused, the six people with knowledge of the situation said.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.The policy changes were onerous because moderators were generally given less than 90 seconds to decide whether images of dead bodies, videos of limbs being blown off or outright calls to violence violated Meta’s rules, they said. In some instances, they added, moderators were shown posts about the war in Chechen, Kazakh or Kyrgyz, despite not knowing those languages.Ms. Lever declined to comment on whether Meta had hired content moderators who specialize in those languages.Emerson T. Brooking, a senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, which studies the spread of online disinformation, said Meta faced a quandary with war content.“Usually, content moderation policy is intended to limit violent content,” he said. “But war is an exercise in violence. There is no way to sanitize war or to pretend that it is anything different.”Meta has also faced employee complaints over its policy shifts. At a meeting this month for workers with ties to Ukraine, employees asked why the company had waited until the war to take action against Russia Today and Sputnik, said two people who attended. Russian state activity was at the center of Facebook’s failure to protect the 2016 U.S. presidential election, they said, and it didn’t make sense that those outlets had continued to operate on Meta’s platforms.ImageThe Russia Today studios in London. Meta has limited Russia Today’s reach on its platforms.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesWhile Meta has no employees in Russia, the company held a separate meeting this month for workers with Russian connections. Those employees said they were concerned that Moscow’s actions against the company would affect them, according to an internal document.In discussions on Meta’s internal forums, which were viewed by The Times, some Russian employees said they had erased their place of work from their online profiles. Others wondered what would happen if they worked in the company’s offices in places with extradition treaties to Russia and “what kind of risks will be associated with working at Meta not just for us but our families.”Ms. Lever said Meta’s “hearts go out to all of our employees who are affected by the war in Ukraine, and our teams are working to make sure they and their families have the support they need.”At a separate company meeting this month, some employees voiced unhappiness with the changes to the speech policies during the war, according to an internal poll. Some asked if the new rules were necessary, calling the changes “a slippery slope” that were “being used as proof that Westerners hate Russians.”Others asked about the effect on Meta’s business. “Will Russian ban affect our revenue for the quarter?

245,"Good evening. This is your Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, a weeknight guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflict.Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine has begun, President Volodymyr Zelensky said, marking a major new phase of the war.A Russian missile attack killed at least seven people in Lviv, the first reported war deaths in the western Ukrainian city.Moscow’s mayor warned that 200,000 jobs were at risk in the city, Russia’s capital, from the impact of sanctions.Follow our live updates.ImageResidents in Mariupol, Ukraine, today. Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersRussia’s eastern offensive startsRussia carried out one of its broadest barrages of missile attacks in weeks, striking more than 300 targets overnight, mainly in eastern Ukraine, according to its defense ministry.The escalation in attacks signaled that Russia’s large-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine was underway. “Now we can state that the Russian forces have started the battle for the Donbas that they have been getting ready for a long time,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address.The Russian assault stretched along nearly the entire, 300-mile front line in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions, said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council.“Our servicemen are holding out,” he said, adding that Russian forces had broken through the front at only two points. Missile attacks also struck Lviv, in Ukraine’s west, and Kharkiv, in the northeast.In the south, Ukrainian fighters were holed up in a sprawling, smoldering steel plant, one of the last redoubts of Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor, said troops were still fighting from two other factories, Azovmash and Illich, elsewhere in the city.Capturing Mariupol would be a major victory for Russia, allowing it to create a strategically important land bridge between eastern Ukraine and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.After weeks of setbacks, including Russia’s retreat from areas surrounding Kyiv and the sinking of the warship Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian forces are making a push to seize more of the eastern Donbas region.The battles in the north that Ukraine won over the past seven weeks raged in towns and densely populated suburbs around Kyiv, but the war in the southeast will be waged in a vast expanse of flatland.That fundamentally changes the nature of the combat, the weapons at play and the strategies that might bring victory. In the next few days, the U.S. will begin training Ukrainian troops to operate powerful howitzers that the Biden administration is sending, a senior Pentagon official said.Related: The Russian military has repeatedly used cluster munitions, which are banned under an international convention.

The brutality of Moscow’s war is familiar to those who have seen Russia’s military in action in Chechnya and in Syria.In Russia, however, such acts are rarely investigated or even acknowledged, let alone punished, our Moscow bureau chief, Anton Troianovski, writes. None of the perpetrators of war crimes in Chechnya, where the Kremlin crushed an independence movement at the cost of tens of thousands of lives, were ever prosecuted in Russia.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Russian bombs and missiles destroyed the Chechen capital of Grozny in 1999 and 2000 and, in 2016, the Syrian rebel stronghold of Aleppo. There is also the cruelty of individual soldiers and units, the horrors of recent atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, appearing to have descended directly from the slaughter a generation ago in the village of Novye Aldi in Chechnya.In February 2000, Aset Chad walked into her neighbor’s yard in the village and saw the bodies of three men and a woman who had been shot in front of her eight-year-old daughter. She was transported back to that moment recently when she saw a photo of a horrified Ukrainian woman in Bucha standing over the bodies of three civilians in her yard.Violence remains commonplace within the Russian military, in which senior soldiers routinely abuse junior ones.To Sergei Krivenko, who leads a rights group that provides legal aid to Russian soldiers, that violence, coupled with a lack of independent oversight, increases the potential for war crimes. Russian soldiers are just as capable of cruelty against fellow Russians, he says, as they are against Ukrainians.But the crimes may also stem from the Kremlin’s years of dehumanizing propaganda against Ukrainians. In a military operation that seemed — at least at first — to be aimed at winning over Ukrainians’ allegiance to Moscow, atrocities against civilians seem grotesquely counterproductive.Russia experienced that in Chechnya, where violence against civilians fueled the Chechen resistance and desire for vengeance.What else we’re followingIn UkraineAn artillery strike killed at least one person and wounded another in a residential area in southeastern Kharkiv.A Russian attack with long-range rockets on the town of Brovary, outside Kyiv, yesterday knocked out electricity in some areas.A Russian missile attack injured four people working for the chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen operation in Kharkiv on Saturday.The Neptune missiles used to sink the Moskva warship were built in Ukraine.

247,"In a photograph from the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, Ukraine, a woman stands in the yard of a house, her hand covering her mouth in horror, the bodies of three dead civilians scattered before her. When Aset Chad saw that picture, she started shaking and hurtled 22 years back in time.In February 2000, she walked into her neighbor’s yard in Chechnya and glimpsed the bodies of three men and a woman who had been shot repeatedly in front of her 8-year-old daughter. Russian soldiers had swept their village and murdered at least 60 people, raped at least six women and plundered the victims’ gold teeth, human rights observers found.“I am having the most severe flashbacks,” Ms. Chad, who now lives in New York, said in a phone interview. “I see exactly what’s going on: I see the same military, the same Russian tactics they use, dehumanizing the people.”The brutality of Moscow’s war on Ukraine takes two distinct forms, familiar to those who have seen Russia’s military in action elsewhere.There is the programmatic violence meted out by Russian bombs and missiles against civilians as well as military targets, meant to demoralize as much as defeat. These attacks recall the aerial destruction in 1999 and 2000 of the Chechen capital of Grozny and, in 2016, of the Syrian rebel stronghold of Aleppo.And then there is the cruelty of individual soldiers and units, the horrors of Bucha appearing to have descended directly from the slaughter a generation ago in Ms. Chad’s village, Novye Aldi.ImageChechens gathering after a market was struck by a Russian missile the day before in Grozny, the capital, in 1999. Much like in Ukraine, the killing of civilians and targeting of civilian areas were common tactics of Russia during the second Chechen war.Credit...Antoine Gyori/Sygma via Getty ImagesCivilian deaths and crimes committed by soldiers figure into every war, not least those fought by the United States in recent decades in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. It has always been difficult to explain why soldiers commit atrocities, or to describe how the orders of commanders, military culture, national propaganda, battlefield frustration and individual malice can come together to produce such horrors.In Russia, however, such acts are rarely investigated or even acknowledged, let alone punished. That leaves it unclear how much the low-level brutality stems from the intent of those in charge or whether commanders failed to control their troops. Combined with the apparent strategy of bombing civilian targets, many observers conclude that the Russian government — and, perhaps, a part of Russian society — in reality condones violence against civilians.Some analysts see the problem as a structural and political one, with the lack of accountability of the Russian armed forces magnified by the absence of independent institutions in Vladimir V. Putin’s authoritarian system or the Soviet Union before it. Compared with the West, fewer people harbor any illusions of individual rights trumping raw power.“I think there is this kind of culture of violence,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko, a Ukrainian philosopher. “Either you are dominating, or you are dominated.”In Ukraine, Russian soldiers, by all appearances, can continue to kill civilians with impunity, as underscored by the fact that virtually none of the perpetrators of war crimes in Chechnya, where the Kremlin crushed an independence movement at the cost of tens of thousands of civilian lives, were ever prosecuted in Russia.Back then, Russian investigators told Ms. Chad that the killings in Novye Aldi might have been perpetrated by Chechens dressed up as Russian troops, she recalls. Now, the Kremlin says any atrocities in Ukraine are either staged or carried out by the Ukrainians and their Western “patrons,” while denouncing as a “Nazi” anyone who resists the Russian advance.Many Russians believe those lies, while those who do not are left wrestling with how such crimes could be carried out in their name.ImageRussian soldiers rolling through the bombed city of Grozny after intense fighting in the second Chechen war, in 2000. In Russia, crimes committed by soldiers are rarely investigated or even acknowledged.Credit...Antoine Gyori/Sygma via Getty ImagesViolence remains commonplace within the Russian military, where more senior soldiers routinely abuse junior ones. Despite two decades of attempts at trying to make the army a more professional force, it has never developed a strong middle tier akin to the noncommissioned officers who bridge the gap between commanders and lower-ranking soldiers in the American military. In 2019, a conscript in Siberia opened fire and killed eight at his military base, later asserting that he had carried out the shooting spree because other soldiers had made his life “hell.”Experts say that the severity of hazing in the Russian military has been reduced compared with the early 2000s, when it killed dozens of conscripts yearly. But they say that order in many units is still maintained through informal systems similar to the abusive hierarchies in Russian prisons.To Sergei Krivenko, who leads a rights group that provides legal aid to Russian soldiers, that violence, coupled with a lack of independent oversight, makes war crimes more possible. Russian soldiers are just as capable of cruelty against fellow Russians, he says, as they are against Ukrainians.“It is the state of the Russian army, this impunity, aggression and internal violence, that is expressed in these conditions,” Mr. Krivenko said in a phone interview. “If there were to be an uprising in Voronezh” — a city in western Russia — “and the army were called in, the soldiers would behave exactly the same way.”But the crimes in Ukraine may also stem from the Kremlin’s years of dehumanizing propaganda against Ukrainians, which soldiers consume in required viewings. Russian conscripts, a sample schedule available on the Russian Defense Ministry’s website shows, must sit through “informational television programs” from 9 to 9:40 p.m. every day but Sunday. The message that they are fighting “Nazis” — as their forefathers did in World War II — is now being spread through the military, Russian news reports show.In one video distributed by the Defense Ministry, a marine commander, Maj. Aleksei Shabulin, says his grandfather “chased fascist scum through the forests” during and after World War II, referring to Ukrainian independence fighters who at one point collaborated with Nazi Germany.ImageA patriotic mural in December on a building in Moscow showing Soviet pilots from World War II. The sign in Russian reads, “The saved world remembers you!” echoing Kremlin attempts to paint “Mother Russia” as a savior.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times“Now I am gloriously continuing this tradition; now my time has come,” Major Shabulin says. “I will not disgrace my great-grandfather and will go to the end.”That propaganda also primed Russian soldiers not to expect much resistance to the invasion — after all, the Kremlin’s narrative went, people in Ukraine had been subjugated by the West and were awaiting liberation by their Russian brethren. Mr. Krivenko, the soldiers’ rights advocate, said he had spoken directly to a Russian soldier who called his group’s hotline and recounted that even when his unit was ordered into Ukraine from Belarus, it was not made clear that the soldiers were about to enter a war zone.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Military commanders’ “attitude to the army is, basically, like to cattle,” Mr. Krivenko said. Mr. Putin has said that only contract soldiers will fight in Ukraine, but his Defense Ministry was forced to admit last month that conscripts — serving the one-year term in the military required of Russian men 18 to 27 — had been sent to the front, as well.Ukrainians did fight back, even though Mr. Putin called them part of “one nation” with Russians in an essay published last year that the Defense Ministry made required reading for its soldiers. The fierce resistance of a people considered to be part of one’s own contributed to the sense that Ukrainians were worse than a typical battlefield adversary, said Mark Galeotti, who studies Russian security affairs.“The fact that ordinary Ukrainians are now taking up arms against you — there is this sense that these aren’t just enemies, these are traitors,” he said.ImageVolunteers with the Territorial Defense Forces receiving weapons training in March, before being deployed to fight against Russian forces near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesAnd treason, Mr. Putin has said, “is the gravest crime possible.”To some extent, the Russian military’s violence against civilians is a feature, not a bug. In Syria, Russia targeted hospitals to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad, a “brutally pragmatic approach to warfare” that has “its own, ghastly” logic, Mr. Galeotti said. It was an echo of Russia’s aerial destruction of Grozny in 1999 and 2000, and a prelude to the fierce siege of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol in the current invasion.The killings of civilians at close range and sexual violence by individual soldiers are a separate matter. In Bucha, civilians told The New York Times that the moods and behaviors of the Russian troops grew uglier as the war progressed, and that the first soldiers to arrive were relatively peaceful.“You have a bunch of sleep-deprived young men with guns for whom, they feel, none of the rules apply,” Mr. Galeotti said.The violence has caused scholars to reassess their understanding of the Russian army. In a military operation that seemed — at least at first — to be aimed at winning over Ukrainians’ allegiance to Moscow, atrocities against civilians seem grotesquely counterproductive. Russia already experienced that in Chechnya, where Russian violence against civilians fueled the Chechen resistance.“Every dead civilian meant a bullet into a Russian soldier,” said Kirill Shamiev, who studies Russian civil-military relations at the Central European University in Vienna. “I thought that they had learned some lessons.”ImageKafr Nabl Surgical Hospital in Idlib, Syria, after a Russian strike in May 2019. The hospital was repeatedly hit during the war.Credit...Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBut Stanislav Gushchenko, a journalist who served as a psychologist in the Russian military in the early 2000s, said he was not surprised by the reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine. He recalled the quotidian violence in his unit and the banal mistreatment of Russian civilians, like the time that a group of soldiers he was traveling with by long-distance train stole a cooked chicken that an older woman in their carriage had brought along for sustenance.In a phone interview from the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Mr. Gushchenko marveled at the Russians who now express shock.“I say, ‘Guys, things were about the same 20 years ago,’” he said. “You lived in your own, closed world, in some kind of bubble, or as psychologists say, in a comfort zone, and didn’t want to notice this or truly didn’t notice.”Alina Lobzina contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Milana Mazaeva from Phoenix, Ariz.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-atrocities.html
248,"Jane Tuv is having so many panic attacks about her aunt, who is refusing to leave Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, that she has turned to medication. The recent horrifying discovery of civilian bodies in a Kyiv suburb has made her even more afraid.Ms. Tuv, who lives in Rego Park, Queens, has meticulously mapped out instructions with bus and train schedules for her aunt, Tetiana Guzik. She has wired money and looked up places to stay in Poland, Hungary and Romania. But Ms. Guzik is staying put.“I literally told her the exact steps she needs to take,” Ms. Tuv, 36, said. “But she’s coming up with all sorts of excuses.”In a recent WhatsApp interview, Ms. Guzik, 53, explained that she had fled before, with all the subsequent feelings of panic, fear and loss, when Russia took over her hometown in Crimea in 2014. It had taken her years to feel like she was home again, and Kyiv was where she intended to stay.Ms. Guzik tries to placate her niece in New York by sending her photos of food items she is able to find amid shortages: cherry-liqueur chocolates one day, a baguette another.“Look!” she said to Ms. Tuv during a WhatsApp chat after one such successful foraging, before describing how, on a recent trip to the supermarket, she heard a loud bang. She ran out to find a rocket had fallen and gotten stuck between two houses. Still, that didn’t deter her: She was staying.ImageTetiana Guzik prefers to stay in Kyiv, having already fled her home in Crimea when the Russians invaded in 2014.“Have you lost your mind?” Ms. Tuv recalled saying to her aunt.“Have you lost your mind?” her aunt retorted. “Stop being hysterical and go take your meds.”Such fraught conversations — between middle-aged and older people refusing to join the exodus of four million Ukrainians from their homeland and their panicked, imploring relatives overseas — have been taking place since the war began. And many of those conversations involve residents of the New York City metropolitan area, which has the largest Ukrainian community in the United States.Reasons for staying vary. For some it’s pride of place, a need not to desert the homeland. For others, it’s the paralyzing fear of unknown factors, like getting caught in crossfire while on a bus or train or bridge. For those who have seen war and displacement before — something many Ukrainians are familiar with — it can be a triggered response to past trauma and violence, psychologists say.“You’re in an altered state,” said Sophia Richman, a Holocaust survivor who is a faculty member at New York University’s Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.“You could justify to yourself and it would be a true rationalization — ‘Oh, everything will be all right. I’m sure everything will be all right.’” Basically, she said, for many older people who have experienced warlike situations before, a kind of self-defense can kick in.This makes sense to Nazar Lubchenko, who has parents and extended family in Kramatorsk, a town bordering Donetsk, one of the breakaway regions that Russia invaded eight years ago. The town was captured for three months. Once Ukraine regained control of the area, his parents renovated their “dacha,” or summer house, planting vegetables and pruning their peach trees.“There is a saying in Ukraine which roughly translates to there being a cherry tree next to my home, and the bees are humming. It symbolizes your ideal life in Ukraine — you have your house, your property and your garden,” he said. “So they will not leave it.”ImageNazar Lubchenko, who lives in New Jersey, has the resources to help his parents flee Ukraine, but they prefer to stay put, he said. “They don’t need any advice from me.”Credit...Misha Friedman for The New York TimesWhen the invasion began in February, Kramatorsk was shelled a number of times. Mr. Lubchenko, 32, who lives in Hoboken, N.J., urged his parents to take a train to western Ukraine. His appeals fell on deaf ears.Taras, his father, shared a link that gave instructions on how to operate an antitank missile, followed by a winking emoji. Olga, his mother, explained that a local oligarch “would take care of us,” and then shared photos that showed her planting seeds in the garden.“They won’t grow well in the basement where you’ll be hiding,” responded Mr. Lubchenko, who has a degree in nuclear physics from M.I.T. and works at a hedge fund.Although he has the resources to help, no amount of money will change his parents’ mind, Mr. Lubchenko said. “They think that they know everything about this life and have all their life experience, and they don’t need any advice from me.”His parents went through the Russian invasion eight years ago, and they are predicting the same will happen this time around, he said. “They still have pasta left over from 2014!”Liza Gutina, who lives in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, has a 65-year-old uncle who is refusing to leave Kherson, in southern Ukraine, one of the cities that was taken over by the Russians in the early days of the invasion.ImageLiza Gutina’s uncle, a mathematician, has chosen to stay in Kherson, a town in southern Ukraine where soldiers mostly keep to themselves, he said.Credit...Misha Friedman for The New York TimesAt first her uncle, Alexander, a mathematician who asked not to be fully identified, was staying put for logistical reasons: The routes out of the city were blocked, and some people got killed on their way out. But now conditions in the streets, her uncle said, have gone from frightening to practically absurd. She worries that he sees life there as a new normal — something disturbing, but survivable.After the Russian soldiers finished looting, her uncle told her, they confined themselves to their armed vehicles in particular parts of the city. Occasionally, he would pass by local protests on his daily walks, during which he would watch the soldiers forcefully remove the most active participants. A few days later, they’d be released and he’d see the protesters again, at another rally.“I feel like I’m in a sci-fi movie where you live a normal life, but you know the aliens are there, and every so often, they steal people, and then give them back,” he said during a recent WhatsApp conversation.For some older Ukrainians, familiarity continues to trump uncertainty.Sasha Krasny, 48, who lives in Forest Hills, Queens, has been trying to persuade her 83-year-old aunt, Ludmila Steblina, to leave her home in Kharkiv, where a bomb went off on her street two weeks ago, blowing out the balcony windows of her apartment.ImageSasha Krasny has been keeping in touch with her 83-year-old aunt, who is living in an apartment with blown-out windows.Credit...Misha Friedman for The New York Times“I thought that would shake her up,” Ms. Krasny said. “But she’s like, ‘No. I know everything here. I know what to expect. If I left, I don’t know where I’m going. I don’t know how I’m going to survive this journey. If I need to go to the bathroom, who will I ask for help?’”After the bomb, Ms. Steblina moved her bed away from the windows, but then fell ill from the cold wind that entered through the blown-out windows, she said. Ms. Krasny worked with volunteers to get her aunt a heater. But future help is uncertain — some of the volunteers have died amid heavy shelling. When there is shelling, Ms. Steblina sits in her bathtub.Image“I know everything here,” said Ludmila Steblina, who lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine. “I know what to expect.”“It’s so stressful for me to be on the outside,” Ms. Krasny said. “I cannot even comprehend what it feels like to be there, so I have to be cognizant of that. Putting pressure — I don’t think it works.”Ms. Guzik, Ms. Tuv’s aunt in Kyiv, has tried to explain to her niece why she is intent on staying in the capital.“Look, you’re round your four walls. You feel safer than when you’re just out wherever you are,” she said from her living room one recent evening, her windows taped over with thick fabric, so that the light would not attract the attention of nocturnal missile strikes.She tried to cheer her niece up, describing how she was skirting a ban on alcohol sales, which was just lifted, by stocking up on chocolates filled with cherry liqueur and getting mildly drunk.She smiled at her niece, her cheeks glowing white from the light of her smartphone.“Somebody has to keep the roots here,” she said, “because whoever hasn’t left yet has to be responsible for keeping the roots.”Misha Friedman contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/nyregion/ukraine-older-people.html
249,"The people torn apart by the explosion were not soldiers. They were children, women, the elderly, bundled in coats and caps, carrying a few belongings in shopping bags and backpacks, and crowded into the train station in Kramatorsk.They were trying to flee, part of a new wave of civilians evacuating eastern Ukraine ahead of an expected Russian onslaught. The rocket attack on the station on Friday killed at least 50 of them, and wounded many more.Ukraine blamed Russia for the strike. Russia denied any responsibility, saying it might have been carried out by Ukrainian forces. Either way, the dead and maimed were supposed to be noncombatants, trying to escape a war Russia had launched against its neighbor.Kramatorsk had been a main departure point for tens of thousands of people trying to head west to safer areas. As it became clearer that Russian forces, struggling to defeat Ukraine militarily, were sowing terror by destroying cities and towns, claiming an unknown number of victims, government officials issued a string of increasingly urgent appeals to people to leave the region.Crowds were seen gathering at the station on Tuesday.ImageCredit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHow many rockets struck was not immediately clear. But several parked cars also were hit, catching fire and turning into charred hulks.ImageCredit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe waiting area turned into a kill zone, with bodies and belongings strewn about. “There are just children!” one woman cried.ImageCredit...Anatolii Stepanov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe bodies were seen at several places along the station platform.

250,"WASHINGTON — Russian forces in Ukraine appear to be using a new type of weapon as they step up attacks on civilian targets: an advanced land mine equipped with sensors that can detect when people walk nearby.Ukrainian bomb technicians discovered the device, called the POM-3, last week near the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Human Rights Watch, a leading human rights group, which has reviewed photos provided by Ukraine’s military.Older types of land mines typically explode when victims accidentally step on them or disturb attached tripwires. But the POM-3’s seismic sensor picks up on approaching footsteps and can effectively distinguish between humans and animals.Humanitarian deminers and groups that campaign against the use of land mines said the POM-3 would make future efforts to locate and destroy unexploded munitions in Ukraine vastly more complicated and deadlier.“These create a threat that we don’t have a response for,” said James Cowan, who leads the HALO Trust, a British American charity that clears land mines and other explosive remnants of war to help countries recover after conflicts. The group began removing unexploded munitions from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine in 2016, after Russian-backed separatists started fighting the Ukrainian government.“We’ll need to find some donors to procure robotics that can allow us to deal with these threats at some distance,” Mr. Cowan added.The POM-3 is typically launched by a rocket and falls back to earth by parachute before sticking into the ground — where it waits, according to CAT-UXO, an online resource for military and civilian bomb technicians. When the mine senses a person, it launches a small explosive warhead that detonates midair, producing fragments that are lethal up to about 50 feet away.Mr. Cowan, a retired British Army major general, said his staff of 430 Ukrainians clearing unexploded munitions in Donbas had been unable to continue working since Russia launched a full invasion of the country in late February, with many staff members temporarily relocating in Ukraine. He anticipates that in the future, HALO’s operation across the country will require about 2,500 workers, given that many areas outside Donbas are now contaminated with unexploded munitions as well.U.S. government officials have said Russia appears to be moving troops to consolidate its hold on Donetsk and Luhansk, which could mean that even more weapons like the POM-3 will be used in the war.“The war is entering a static phase — trenches are being dug,” Mr. Cowan said. “This is the time when I would expect the Russians to start using land mines on a massive basis.”HALO, which stands for Hazardous Area Life-Support Organization, has about 10,000 employees around the world and is among the few international nonprofits that have remained in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul, the capital, in August. Mr. Cowan said the future cleanup in Ukraine would require roughly the same number of workers as HALO’s current operation in Afghanistan, which is recovering from decades of armed conflict.The POM-3 is just one new hazard among many that his organization expects to encounter, in addition to an untold number of rockets, bombs and artillery shells that failed to detonate on impact. Russia has also attacked Ukrainian arms depots, causing fires and explosions that typically fling hundreds or even thousands of damaged munitions into surrounding areas.Once widely used around the world, antipersonnel land mines often kill and maim civilians long after hostilities have ceased. Ukraine is one of the 164 nations that have signed a 1997 treaty banning the use of antipersonnel land mines and pledged to purge their stockpiles. The United States and Russia have refused to join it.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.The treaty does not prohibit the use of antitank land mines — which typically have a much larger explosive charge and are designed to detonate only when a vehicle drives over or near them — nor does it address improvised explosive devices built to destroy vehicles. Videos posted on social media purport to show both antitank mines and improvised bomb attacks on Russian vehicles in Ukraine.Russia’s use of land mines was among the discussions at an event on Tuesday on Capitol Hill for the United Nations’ international mine awareness day, which brought together groups that focus on the issue and lawmakers from Congress’s Unexploded Ordnance/Demining Caucus.“Wars end, they stay,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said of land mines and unexploded munitions. “The targets are invariably civilians, and they are in places where you have a limited ability to provide lifesaving medical care.”“Look at what’s happening in Ukraine — Russia is placing land mines in people’s homes, as well as children’s playgrounds and places where people go,” Mr. Leahy said. “That’s using it as a weapon of terror.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/russia-ukraine-land-mines.html
251,"It wasn’t the sounds of the bombs, though he did hear those, that brought back the memories for Darijo Srna. It was the air raid sirens.When they blared in Kyiv shortly after 6 a.m. on Feb. 24, Srna froze in terror. His mind flooded with thoughts and recollections of his childhood, of his first experience with war, when the former Yugoslavia broke apart in the 1990s.Since then, soccer has taken Srna, 39, far from his home in Croatia to a distinguished career, the bulk of it with the Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk, where he is currently the director of football, and to games in the Champions League and at two World Cups. But in an instant, the sounds of sirens brought it all back.“I started to panic,” he said. “You have some trauma for all your life, for sure — deep in yourself. That is something you try to forget. But you can never forget these types of things.”Shakhtar Donetsk had run from bombs before. In 2014, the last time Russian forces invaded Ukraine, missiles landed on Shakhtar’s stadium.

Last week, after receiving special permission to take military-age men out of the country, its players and coaches landed in Istanbul. With war leading to the suspension of the second half of the Ukrainian season, Shakhtar will soon become a touring team, playing exhibition games — the first was Saturday in Greece — to bring attention to the plight of Ukrainians and to raise money for the war effort.Shakhtar Donetsk had never stopped being a team. Now, it hopes, it will be a symbol, too.“I don’t know which kind of team in the history of football can be compared to us,” Srna said. “No other team has ever felt or lived what we have in these past eight years.”A Team in ExileImageShakhtar players training in Istanbul last week.

Here’s a breakdown of the draw and a look at how each country qualified.The Host: After a decade of scrutiny and criticism, there is a sense that Qatar will at last get the payoff it expected for hosting the World Cup.Traveling to Qatar: Thinking about attending the tournament? Here is what you should know.So in February, Sergei Palkin, Shakhtar’s chief executive, called a meeting in an effort to assuage the growing concerns.“I said that everything would be OK because the president of Ukraine, everybody, was saying that no problems, war will not come,” Palkin said.The team flew back to Kyiv. But Palkin was wrong. Three days later, Russian troops streamed across the border, and rather than prepare to play the second half of its league season, the team’s management suddenly found itself needing to make altogether different calculations.While many of Shakhtar’s Ukrainian players relocated to Lviv, which hosted the team when it was first forced to leave Donetsk, a group of more than 50 players and staff members took refuge in a hotel owned by the team owner Rinat Akhmetov. From there, timely help and frantic phone calls helped forge a plan to get the club’s foreign players and their families to safety.Srna was a key conduit in those discussions, which also involved players’ unions, Ukrainian and neighboring soccer federations and the sport’s governing body in Europe, UEFA. He said his own experiences — he was also a member of the team the last time it fled to safety, in 2014 — served as a guide.“Unfortunately,” he said ruefully, “this is my third war.”Only after the players were on their way home to South America and elsewhere did Srna embark on a journey of his own: what turned out to be a 37-hour drive to Croatia, where much of his family still lives, to reassure them he was safe. Two family members on his father’s side were killed after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, so his weren’t the only nerves that needed calming.ImageSergei Palkin had tried to reassure his team that there would be no war. He was wrong.Credit...Bradley Secker for The New York TimesAfter touching base, though, Srna quickly set about tackling a new task: how to move the dozens of children based in Shakhtar’s youth academy outside Kyiv out of harm’s way. The effort was professional but also intensely personal: Many of the children were only 12 and 13, about the age Srna had been when he first experienced war.Hajduk Split, Srna’s first professional club, said it would be willing to accommodate the boys if they could get to the city. Dinamo Zagreb, another Croatian team, said it would provide buses if Shakhtar could get the players to Ukraine’s border with Hungary. The players and the rest of Shakhtar’s traveling party spent two days at Dinamo’s stadium, Srna said, where they were fed and evaluated by doctors before moving on to Split.Today, because of the effort, more than 80 children, some of their mothers and a few aging coaches and medical staff members are safely in Croatia, far from the worst horrors of war, training and even playing games again.“I just put myself in their situation,” Srna said of his involvement. “I didn’t want these children to stay and listen all day to bombing and bullets.“What I remember when I was a kid, I remember who gave me chocolate, who gave me a ball, who gave me water. And that was what was most important.”Waving the FlagImageShakhtar players wore Ukrainian flags onto the field against Olympiakos on Saturday.Credit...Yorgos Karahalis/Associated PressLike every other corner of the Ukrainian population, Shakhtar has been touched by the war in more serious ways, too. A coach from the team’s academy died after his hometown was overrun by Russian forces in the first weeks of the war. Two staff members from the team’s merchandising department have taken up arms.Shakhtar’s training site in Kyiv also bears the scars of conflict. Chunks of its training fields have been gouged by shelling, and artillery fire ripped open sheds where the team stored training equipment.The conflict has also brought renewed attention to figures like Akhmetov, Ukraine’s wealthiest man. Like a handful of oligarchs in Russia, he grew immensely rich — sometimes amid questions of dubious means — in the wild and unpredictable aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union. Akhmetov has made a point to be seen as contributing millions of dollars of his fortune to the war effort, and he said in an interview that he remained committed to his country and team. “All our efforts are focused on the only thing that matters — to help Ukraine win this war,” he said.The efforts of Akhmetov and his soccer team are now entwined with those of the Ukrainian government — relationships that have already helped Shakhtar overcome some unique hurdles. Before it could depart for Turkey, for example, the club needed special government exemptions from an emergency law barring military-age men from leaving the country during the war. Those approvals finally arrived on Wednesday afternoon. Now that it is based in Istanbul, its tour will serve several functions.The games, starting with one against Olympiakos in Athens on Saturday, are viewed in part as a diplomatic tool, a chance to personalize Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis, raise money for the country’s military and provide humanitarian aid for its citizens.But the matches will also play an important sporting role. Several Shakhtar Donetsk players are also members of Ukraine’s national team, and the games will help to ensure their fitness ahead of a key qualification playoff in June for the 2022 World Cup. (Shakhtar’s rival, Dynamo Kyiv, is playing a series of exhibition games for the same reasons; both clubs have said they will call up players from other Ukrainian teams to supplement their rosters, in part so Ukraine has the best chance of advancing to the World Cup in the June playoff.)ImageShakhtar’s games have multiple aims: to raise awareness about the country’s plight and to keep its national team sharp ahead of a World Cup qualifying playoff in June. Credit...Yorgos Karahalis/Associated PressThe Shakhtar team that will take part in the coming tour — matches against Polish and Turkish clubs have been arranged, and games against A-list opponents could follow — has been shorn of much of its international talent: Most of those players exercised an option allowing them to temporarily sign with teams outside Ukraine after the outbreak of war. Most will never return. But some, like the Brazilian defender Marlon, have said they will be back, and others are mulling their options.“We are not angry, we are all human beings,” Srna said. “It’s important they are safe and with their family.”The new season in Ukraine is, for now, scheduled to begin in July. With so much damage to the country and war still raging, the timetable appears to be little more than a place holder. When soccer returns, as it eventually will, nothing will be the same.It is not even clear if Donetsk, Shakhtar’s home, will remain a part of Ukraine, a prospect that could make the team’s temporary exile a permanent one. Whatever the case, whatever the conclusion, team officials said Shakhtar would never turn its back on its roots.“They can put any flag they like in Donetsk,” Srna said. “But Shakhtar will always be from Donetsk; it’s something no one and nothing can ever change.”Wherever Shakhtar ends up calling home, whoever it plays in the interim, one idea remains impossible to even contemplate: games against Russian opponents. Palkin said he was confident European soccer officials would ensure that Ukrainian teams would not cross paths with opponents from Russia in future competitions. But he had a simple answer if Shakhtar was ever faced with such a matchup. “We wouldn’t play,” he said.ImageToys were placed in a section of seats on Saturday as a memorial to the children who have died in the war.Credit...Louiza Vradi/Reuters",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/sports/soccer/ukraine-soccer-shakhtar-donetsk.html
252,"KRAKOW, Poland — Across Ukraine, kindergartens have been bombed, elementary schools have been converted into shelters and in some cities like Mariupol, their grounds have even become makeshift graveyards.As the war tears at the social institutions of the country, education has been one of the major casualties. Parents, teachers and school administrators are scrambling to provide classes for the 5.5 million school-age children who remain in the country, as well as for thousands of others who have fled to other countries.In many places, students are connecting with their normal classrooms online, if their hometown schools are still operating and they have access to the internet. But with such vast displacement of teachers and students, the paths to learning are circuitous: In some cases, teachers who relocated within Ukraine are instructing students who have already fled the country, through a school system that they both left behind.“The study is just like during the Covid times but with constant interruptions for the air sirens,” said Inna Pasichnyk, 29, who fled with her 11-year-old son, Volodymyr, to the Czech Republic from their home in the Donetsk region. He still dials into his classroom every day.Alla Porkhovnyuk now teaches classes remotely to 11- to 13-year-olds after fleeing with her children from the port town of Yuzhne, near Odesa, to stay with relatives in central Ukraine. As well as teaching history, much of her job involves providing reassurance to the children amid fears about the war.“They often ask when will the war end, when will they return to school?” she said. “I always smile and say that it will be soon — we have to be patient a little longer.”ImageA newly built school that was damaged during a missile strike in Kyiv in March. Many classrooms across Ukraine are simply unusable after being damaged or destroyed.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesMillions of children and teachers have been forced to flee their homes since the Russian invasion began in February. Some end up elsewhere in Europe as refugees and join classrooms in unfamiliar countries and in unfamiliar languages. Some have taken advantage of initiatives by Ukraine’s ministry of education that allow them to continue their studies online while sheltering abroad — even if it is not through their own school district.More than 13,000 schools have instituted remote learning, and a few dozen have a blend of in-person and online learning. There are nearly 1,100 schools in areas where the educational process has been suspended entirely because the security situation is so tense, officials said.Many classrooms across Ukraine are simply unusable, after being damaged or destroyed, or used in some areas for military purposes.“Sadly, in Ukraine, schools continue to come under attack,” said Joe English, a communications specialist from UNICEF who has spent time in Ukraine during the war.In times of war, classrooms can and should provide children with a sense of stability and act as a safe space to learn and to process the trauma, Mr. English said.Ms. Pasichnyk and her son had been living in Kramatorsk, a city in the east that was the site of a devastating attack on a train station last week. When the war began, they fled their home in a rush, and Ms. Pasichnyk said she did not even remember how she packed her bag or what was in it.ImageChildren displaced from their homes attended an online class in Lviv, in western Ukraine, in March.Credit...Bernat Armangue/Associated Press“But Volodymyr even managed to take a pencil case and a notebook,” she said of her son. After they relocated and got settled, he restarted his education over video call.When the air-raid siren starts, those still in the city have to take shelter, she said, and lessons can get derailed.“Of course, this is not the same schooling as in the days before the fighting in our city,” Ms. Pasichnyk said, but she is happy that her son is at least getting back into a regular routine.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Ms. Porkhovnyuk, the history teacher, hopes to return home soon, but for now, she logs on daily to teach her classes.

The classes have been cut to just 30 minutes, and students are not given any homework or tests. Her focus is less on imparting new knowledge and more on distracting the children from the war, Ms. Porkhovnyuk said.“My students are constantly forced to hide in basements and bomb shelters,” she said. “It is impossible to get used to it.”Olena Yurchenko, 24, who teaches 10- and 11-year-olds at a private school in Kyiv, the capital, said classes resumed online at the end of March. She said she was nervous for the first class, because she did not know if all of her students were safe.ImageChildren from Odesa, with family members, rested before crossing into Poland in March.

Some of these areas have large ethnic Russian populations.Russian forces, for instance, detained the head of the education department in the occupied city of Melitopol, the mayor there said in late March, after educators pushed back against orders to change the curriculum.The mayor, Ivan Fedorov, said in a video that Russian forces were trying to impose a shift in what schools taught, demanding that schools return to in-person classes that are taught in Russian.“The occupiers go to schools, kindergartens and force our teachers and educators to resume the educational process using an incomprehensible Russian program,” Mr. Fedorov said in the video.Students in the city have continued classes online, but local officials have stressed that it was too dangerous for children to return to the classroom. Melitopol, in a key stretch of southeastern territory between Russia-annexed Crimea and areas controlled by separatists in the east, has been occupied by Russian forces since the early days of the invasion.ImageRefugee children from Odesa finishing a math class in Tudora, Moldova, near the border with Ukraine, in March.

But on Monday, the new local government installed by Russian forces said it planned to reopen schools, according to Russian state television. It is unclear if that happened, and Mr. Fedorov said local teachers were not cooperating.Eight years of war with Russia-backed separatists had already taken its toll on Ukraine’s east. More than 750 schools in the region had been destroyed, damaged or forced to close even before the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.Save the Children, an international charity focused on bettering children’s lives, has warned that attacks on schools and other education facilities are a grave violation against children and can constitute a war crime.Ms. Yurchenko, the private school teacher in Kyiv, hopes that the war will not drag on and that she and her students can return to their normal routines soon.“But I am sure that for both children and adults, it will not be the same,” she said. “We have all changed — the children have grown up in front of our eyes.”Nataliia Novosolova contributed reporting from Vinnytsia, Ukraine.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/ukraine-schools-war.html

254,"KHARKIV, Ukraine — Soldiers waved off traffic, emerging from trenches dug into the side of a multistory apartment building, telling motorists to turn around. Firefighters arrived soon after, unfurling hoses to combat a growing blaze ignited by an artillery round that hit a nearby housing complex.More than 30 days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine there is little chance that Russian forces can soon seize Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million roughly 30 miles from the Russian border. But every day howitzer shells, rockets and guided missiles slam into its neighborhoods. Parts of the city are now unrecognizable. Many people have fled or live underground.This systematic destruction produces little military gain, but is part of a broader strategy to seize the country’s East, analysts and U.S. military officials say.The devastation of Kharkiv is a template for Russia’s shifting strategy as it turns its attention to Ukraine’s Donbas region, a swath of land in the East that is roughly the size of New Hampshire. It encompasses two breakaway enclaves located southeast of Kharkiv, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for eight years. A significant amount of Ukrainian forces are still entrenched there.ImageFirefighters at the scene of a fire at an apartment complex struck by a bomb in Kharkiv on Sunday.ImageThe site of an apparent missile strike last week in the vicinity of a cultural center near central Kharkiv that was being used as a military barracks.Having failed to score a quick victory or capture Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, Russia has resorted to shelling large population centers like Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south, to ensure that Ukrainian resources, manpower and civil services are occupied away from the front lines where the Russians are looking to take territory.“They’re trying to tie up Ukrainian forces so they can focus on the northern and southern part” of the country’s east, said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.It’s a critical goal for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Gaining control of the Donbas would effectively partition off a piece of Eastern Ukraine, and the Russian leader could sell it to his country as a victory — perhaps by May 9, Russia’s Victory Day, when the country honors its triumph over Germany in World War II.At the same time, Mr. Putin also has aides engaged in peace talks that could serve as something of a backup option if Russia falls short of a decisive battlefield victory. A peace agreement that includes significant Ukrainian concessions could give Mr. Putin a way to declare that Russia’s mission was accomplished, even if its forces failed to topple the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.ImageLining up for milk on a street in Kharkiv on Monday. Residents who have remained in the city have had to contend with shortages of basic goods.ImageResidents at a bombed apartment complex in Kharkiv on Sunday evening as the area continued to come under attack.Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city and once home to a vibrant social scene, is practically a ghost town. At 8 p.m. shades are drawn and a citywide blackout lasts until sunrise. Stars are easily seen in the night sky.Some neighborhoods are untouched by the shelling, while others are completely decimated. Apartments in the hard-hit areas are burned out, cars flipped over, wires severed and shrapnel litters what seems like every square foot of some thoroughfares, easily popping car tires.The shelling diverts resources that might otherwise go toward fighting. Soldiers have to dig trenches around the city’s perimeter waiting for a ground attack that will likely never come. Police dart around the city, pulling people over and arresting those suspected of being Russian saboteurs. The city’s fire department logs an average of 10 to 20 calls a day, often just to deal with the damage from the shelling, and is frequently forced to rely on its own water tankers because of the extensive damage to hydrants.Russia’s initial attempts to completely seize Ukraine failed almost as soon as they began, an outcome that surprised many analysts. The conventional thinking was that Ukraine, with the far smaller and less equipped military, would be outmatched and that the Russians would end up fighting an insurgency instead of a standing military.ImageResponding to a bombing at an apartment complex in Kharkiv.ImageUstenko Nina Fedorovna, 85, in her apartment in a residential area of Kharkiv that has been under continual bombing. Her building has already been extensively damaged.The opposite turned out to be true. As Russian forces have retreated around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have gained ground in the country’s northeast and south. The southern city of Mariupol has been encircled and under siege by Russian troops for weeks, but has not been captured. Neither has another southern coastal city, Mykolaiv, also a target of Russian attacks. Dueling artillery battles have become the norm as infantry forces on both sides dig in.But even though Russia was plagued by low morale, logistical problems and casualties, its units, for the most part, did not surrender en masse or flee.The Russian failure boiled down to one point, analysts said: doing too much at once.“Eventually it became clear their initial campaign was a completely unworkable military strategy,” Mr. Kofman said. “They were competing along axes of advancement, and they were basically advancing in opposite directions on the way. There was no way they were going to succeed.”Russia’s repositioning has created, in some ways, a pause in the war. With its first phase over and the second phase just beginning, both sides are trying to prepare for each other’s next move.“To attempt an assault in the Donbas, the Russians will need access to all the forces they’ve stuck around Kyiv,” Mr. Kofman said, a conclusion that military officials in Washington have also reached.By shifting forces to the east, Moscow has limited the amount of pressure on its forces; the occupied separatist regions and the heavily mined front lines there provide a natural backstop for any future Russian advances. The separatist forces there have also provided willing backup troops that helped Russia make progress earlier in the war.But even with modest Russian gains around the Donbas and the reshuffling of forces from Kyiv, it remains unclear if Russia has enough forces to complete its strategy of encircling the Ukrainian forces entrenched in the Donbas, seizing the region and completing a land bridge to occupied Crimea, which it seized in 2014.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Losses of armored vehicles — key pieces of equipment necessary in any kind of offensive in this type of war — number in the hundreds, according to military research groups.ImageThe body of a Russian soldier near Kharkiv, in February.ImageA Ukrainian soldier recovering a disabled T-72 Russian tank in the town of Trostyanets last week.What remains even murkier is the current state of Ukrainian forces.Ukraine’s government has severely restricted information about its casualty numbers, and front-line access to its forces is practically nonexistent for most news organizations. But what is clear is that Ukrainian units are involved in a protracted fight, and on the receiving end of advanced armaments, air support, heavy artillery and a determined enemy. This leaves the question: How long can they hold?Around Izium, a city of roughly 45,000 some 75 miles southeast of Kharkiv, Russian forces suffered less severe losses than did Ukrainian fighters, according to a U.S. military official, enabling Russian troops to solidify their front lines. Despite the city’s strategic importance, Ukrainian forces could not withstand the attack.“The Ukrainian military has lost a substantive amount of equipment and will need a significant amount of ammunition for its artillery units,” Mr. Kofman said. “The Ukrainian government has also mobilized a significant amount of their reserves; they just don’t have enough equipment for them.”Though Western-supplied weapons, such as the Javelin anti-tank missile, have received a lot of attention, the war in Ukraine has also turned heavily on indirect fire: mortars, howitzers and rockets. So far, the Russian strategy has been to use heavy shelling to help take territory, then build fortifications and defend it until their casualties become unsustainable.That strategy has worked for the Ukrainians too. This was apparent in Trostyanets, a town in northeastern Ukraine that was retaken from the Russians several days ago. The tide of the battle turned, residents said, when Ukrainian forces successfully shelled and destroyed the Russian artillery position in one of the town’s squares.Analysts say this dynamic will continue to play out in the Donbas, a less populated area compared with western Ukraine, with small towns, road networks that stretch for miles and mostly flat fields.“The Ukrainian forces have had a lot of success where Russian forces have been really degraded and have had to retreat because of their losses,” Mr. Kofman said. “But there are still major battles to come.”ImageTrostyanets was held by the Russian military for roughly 30 days before the Ukrainian military retook the town on March 26.Natalia Yermak contributed reporting from Kharkiv, Ukraine, and Anton Troianovski from Istanbul.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/ukraine-war-east-russia.html
255,"BERLIN — Fierce debate over sending heavy weapons to Ukraine has struck a fault line through Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government, raising questions about his leadership and dampening expectations of his ability to help steer Europe through the continent’s most dramatic security crisis since World War II.With Russia opening a new offensive in eastern Ukraine, calls have grown for Berlin to offer more heavy weaponry to the Ukrainian government in Kyiv. Members of Mr. Scholz’s coalition have publicly broken ranks with him to demand that Germany do more. “Europe expects Germany to play a central role,” said Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, the head of the parliamentary defense committee and a lawmaker from the liberal Free Democratic Party, a coalition partner with Mr. Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats and the Greens.Mr. Scholz has largely evaded explaining his stance on heavy weapons, and was losing the opportunity to frame the debate, she said, adding: “If you don’t do the storytelling yourself, others will. And that’s never good.”Just two months ago, Mr. Scholz was defining the conversation. Following Russia’s invasion, he announced a massive rearmament of Germany and a defense aid package for Ukraine in a dramatic break with decades of pacifist policy. He declared it a “Zeitenwende” — a historical turning point — for Germany. But on Ukraine, his critics argue, Mr. Scholz needs to move more swiftly, saying the financial aid he announced last week could not come as fast as direct deliveries of weapons.ImageUkraine has requested German Leopard tanks.Credit...Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesFor Mr. Scholz, the act of balancing international and domestic politics also includes the expectation of many Europeans that he act as a leader of the continent — a role his predecessor Angela Merkel often filled at moments of crisis. Another perception is important for Mr. Scholz’s government — it is wary of giving Moscow the impression that Berlin is an active belligerent against Russia, at risk of being drawn into a war that would hurt not just Germany but its NATO allies.Germany has already sent missiles and artillery to Ukraine, but Kyiv also wants heavy artillery, Leopard tanks and armored vehicles like the Marder, considered among the best in the world. Ukrainian officials have made repeated public demands. With tensions between Berlin and Kyiv rising, Ukraine went as far as disinviting Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, from a visit to its capital, to protest his longstanding business ties to Moscow.On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a Green, insisted that sending armored vehicles to Ukraine wasn’t a red line for Germany. It was “not taboo, even if it sometimes sounds that way in the German debate,” she said during a news conference with her Baltic counterparts in Riga, Latvia.Still, the perceived reluctance to fulfill Ukraine’s demands, particularly at the same time Germany has slowed a European plan to boycott Russian oil, is frustrating Mr. Scholz’s governing partners. They argue that Germany is running out of time to help rein in President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.ImageForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock of Germany, during a news conference with her Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian counterparts on Wednesday in Riga, Latvia.Credit...Toms Kalnins/EPA, via Shutterstock“The longer this war drags on, and the closer Putin gets to a victory, the greater the danger that more countries will be invaded, and that we then end up sliding into an extended, de facto third world war,” Anton Hofreiter, the head of the European relations committee in the Bundestag and a member of the Greens, said on the public broadcaster ZDF on Wednesday morning.Nils Schmid, a foreign policy spokesman for the Social Democrats in Parliament, said Mr. Scholz’s position has been unfairly skewered by his partners.“There is now a public contest from the opposition but also within the government about who is most supportive of Ukraine,” he said. “What really counts is the action taken by the government.”He pointed out that Germany had given its approval, which was required for the Czech Republic to send T-72 tanks, made in the former East Germany, to Ukraine. That, he said, showed that the chancellor had “no objection” to heavy weapons.But the bickering may have ramifications for Mr. Scholz’s leadership. In a poll of German voters released on Tuesday, 65 percent of respondents said they did not see him as a strong leader. The magazine Der Spiegel on Wednesday wrote, “One has to ask whether the coalition is fundamentally still behind him.”ImageA Ukrainian soldier driving a captured Russian T-72 tank last month. The Czech Republic has provided similar tanks to the Ukrainian military.Credit...Serhii Nuzhnenko/ReutersUwe Jun, a political scientist at Trier University, dismissed the idea of a coalition under threat. But he did see a risk for the chancellor’s reputation as a leader for the continent.For Europeans, that need is especially great, Mr. Jun said, because President Emmanuel Macron of France is receding from the regional stage to fend off a ring-wing electoral challenge at home.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“Scholz was expected to fill this vacuum,” Mr. Jun said. “And there is a certain disappointment, I would say, that Scholz hasn’t done that.”On Tuesday, after discussing Ukraine with other Western leaders, Mr. Scholz stirred up expectations by saying he would give a speech.But the only new announcement from him, Ms. Strack-Zimmerman of the Free Democratic Party said, was a plan to help Eastern European countries provide their own Soviet-era equipment to Ukraine in larger amounts by promising to replace them with German-made material. Even that, she said, was something that could have been started earlier: “We had been suggesting that for three weeks.”Mr. Scholz reiterated a plan announced last week to provide 1 billion euros in military aid, allowing Ukraine to buy the weapons it needs directly from the defense industry. Berlin asked German defense contractors to draw up a list of what they could supply quickly, and sent it to Ukraine, Mr. Scholz said. Kyiv would also be allowed to buy from other allied countries, he added.Mr. Scholz said that Germany, which for decades left its military underequipped, could not afford to give Ukraine more of its own arms and still meet its national and NATO defense obligations.“We have to recognize the possibilities we have are reaching their limits,” he said.His stance on sending tanks and other heavy weapons to Ukraine, however, remained vague, and he would not clarify to journalists afterward whether Berlin would allow German defense contractors to sell such arms to Ukraine.Pressed by a reporter whether he would respond to Ukraine’s demands for Leopard tanks, Mr. Scholz replied: “Looking at the world sometimes helps. In this case, it leads to the realization that those who are in a comparable position to Germany are acting in the same way as we are.”It was an ill-timed retort, given that hours earlier the Netherlands had announced it would be providing heavy weapons, including armored vehicles, to Ukraine.“Scholz doesn’t care about public perceptions,” Mr. Schmid said. “He concentrates on action. And he dislikes doing things based on public debate.”In response to the debate, Mr. Scholz has seemed taciturn, even sarcastic. His frustration was particularly evident after a delegation of Bundestag members visited Ukraine last week — a move his chancellery reportedly discouraged.The delegation included Ms. Strack-Zimmermann from the F.D.P., Mr. Hofreiter from the Greens, and Michael Roth from the S.P.D. All of them backed demands for heavy weaponry, and called on the chancellor to show stronger leadership.Replying a few days later, in a television interview, he said: “To the boys and girls, I have to say: The fact I don’t just do what you want, that shows that I’m leading.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/world/europe/germany-ukraine-weapons.html

258,"LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine said Monday that Russian forces had launched a ground assault along a nearly 300-mile front in the east after hitting the country with one of the most intense missile barrages in weeks, including the first lethal strike on Lviv, the western city that has been a refuge for tens of thousands of fleeing civilians.The missile strikes, which killed at least seven people in Lviv alone, punctured any illusions that the picturesque city of cobbled streets and graceful squares near Poland’s border was still a sanctuary from the horrors Russia has inflicted elsewhere in Ukraine over the past two months.ImageA Ukranian serviceman looking into a crater and a destroyed home in the village of Yatskivka, eastern Ukraine, on Saturday.Credit...Ronaldo Schemidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Lviv attack followed 300 missile and artillery strikes that Russia claimed to have carried out, mainly in the east, in what appeared to be a campaign to terrorize the population and intimidate Ukraine’s military before the new ground offensive had begun in the part of the country known as the Donbas.The secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said on national television that the Russian ground assault, which had been anticipated for weeks, stretched along nearly the entire front line, from the northern Kharkiv region south to the besieged port of Mariupol.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said, “A very significant part of the Russian army is now concentrated for that offensive,” adding, “No matter how many servicemen get thrown there, we will fight, we will defend ourselves.”ImageAlexandre Bulatov, 49, digging a grave Monday at the civilian section of a cemetery in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, Ukraine.Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesThe overnight missile barrage targeted fuel depots, warehouses and other infrastructure, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry. Russian forces also appeared to be finally seizing the entire port of Mariupol, where outnumbered Ukrainian fighters defied demands to lay down their weapons at a vast steel plant that has become a kind of industrial Alamo.Mariupol, a once-vibrant city in southeast Ukraine, is the last obstacle to Russia’s drive to secure a “land bridge” to Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russian forces eight years ago.The intensified attacks came amid signs that international sanctions were beginning to choke Russia’s economy — and in the process, opening fissures between the country’s leaders. President Vladimir V. Putin insisted that “the strategy of an economic blitzkrieg has failed.” But Moscow’s mayor warned that 200,000 people risked losing their jobs in the capital alone, while the head of the central bank warned that the effect of Russia’s isolation was just starting to be felt.While Ukraine’s east remained the focus of Russia’s recalibrated military ambitions, the strike on Lviv was a lethal reminder that no Ukrainian city, even one scarcely 50 miles from the Polish border, lies outside the range of Moscow’s rockets.ImageAnna Mynjo, right, weeps at the funeral Monday of her son, Ivan Mynjo, 24, in Lviv in western Ukraine. Mr. Mynjo was killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesGray smoke billowed from what remained of the red roof of a long concrete garage on the city’s western outskirts, a sign outside advertising “carwash” and “tire replacement.” A hole in the roof indicated that the building had taken a direct hit from a missile. Air raid sirens wailed continuously as firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames and ambulances ferried away the wounded.While the garage burned, a train rumbled by toward Lviv’s nearby railway station, carrying passengers fleeing the fighting in the eastern city of Dnipro. It stopped briefly and the train’s conductors and other workers tried to reassure anxious passengers as they started hearing about the airstrikes by phone.“It was panic,” said Anna Khrystiuk, a volunteer who was handing out information to displaced people, several of whom ran to a shelter in the station when the missiles hit. “Many people were from Kharkiv and other places and they were so afraid of rockets already. They thought that it was safe to stay here.”In Kharkiv, a northeastern city shelled relentlessly since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, a fresh artillery strike killed at least one person in a residential area. The victim was standing a few yards from an apartment building that was struck. It came after a concerted missile barrage on Sunday killed at least five people in the city’s center.ImageAn artillery strike on Monday killed at least one person and wounded another in a residential area in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“It was the first time this neighborhood was hit,” said Lubov Ustymenko, 72, who wore a winter coat and stood a few yards from a discarded umbrella and a puddle filled with a mix of blood and the morning’s light rain. “Our life is decided in one second — you go outside, and then you’re gone.”Russia’s ground onslaught — a push to seize more of the Donbas — got underway after weeks of setbacks, including Russia’s retreat from areas surrounding the capital, Kyiv, and the sinking of a major Russian warship in the Black Sea.Having failed in the early weeks of the war to destroy the Ukrainian military’s network of fuel and ammunition depots — perhaps under the erroneous assumption that Ukrainian forces would surrender wholesale — Russia has intensified its attacks against those facilities, as well as against transportation infrastructure.But Russia’s puzzling failure to do so earlier has left its forces with costly unfinished business, and given Ukrainian troops an unexpected advantage. Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, said that while Russia has hit railway facilities, so far it has avoided aiming missiles at bridges over big rivers.“If Russia plans to expand its presence on Ukraine’s territory — and the end goal since 2014 has been the destruction of Ukrainian statehood as such — it would need the railway too,” Mr. Luzin said.ImageA Ukrainian Army position just outside Mykolaiv, Ukraine, last month.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBesides targeting Kharkiv, Russian forces have unleashed further destruction on eastern cities like Mykolaiv, which lies in Russia’s pathway to the Black Sea port of Odesa. Those attacks have tied up Ukrainian forces and prevented them from joining the fight farther east, while sowing terror among civilians after Russia failed to conquer these cities early in the war.In Mariupol, devastated by weeks of siege warfare, a band of Ukrainian fighters remained ensconced in the Azovstal steel plant after having rejected Russian demands to surrender. Russia intensified its bombing of the factory, and it was unclear how long the Ukrainians could endure in the plant’s labyrinthine underground tunnels. Officials on both sides said Russia could control the city soon.Even with much of Mariupol now a wasteland, the city’s capture would represent a key strategic prize for Russia and would free up forces for its Donbas offensive.ImageAn aerial view of residential buildings that were damaged by shelling in the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine.Credit...Pavel Klimov/ReutersStill, British defense intelligence officials said the grinding battle for the city has become a source of anxiety for Russian commanders.“Concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and matériel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere,” said Mick Smeath, a British defense attaché. He likened Russia’s treatment of Mariupol to its brutal tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.After two months of fighting, pro-war commentators in Russia are pushing the army for tangible military victories that would cover up some of the embarrassments Moscow has suffered, including the sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of the Kremlin’s Black Sea fleet, and the retreat from around Kyiv. So far, Russia has been able to claim only the capture of Kherson, a regional capital, as a significant battlefield achievement.ImageAn aerial view of an air base in Kherson, Ukraine, one of the few cities in the country seized by Russia since the invasion. Credit...Maxar TechnologiesOn Russia’s state-run television, commentators have enthusiastically promoted the Donbas offensive as a decisive battle that could be a turning point in the war. Many point toward May 9, the commemoration of Russia’s 1945 victory over Nazi Germany, as the date when Mr. Putin could claim a semblance of victory in Ukraine.“The big battle for the Donbas has already started,” said Yuri Podolyaka, a pro-Russia analyst who publishes military reports on his popular channel on Telegram. “The activity of the Russian artillery and air forces has intensified again.”On Monday, the head of the regional administration in Luhansk, which is part of the Donbas, said that Russian forces had gained control of the town of Kreminna, adding to territory in the region held by Moscow.Still, those scattered Russian advances carry less psychological punch than lethal strikes on Lviv, a city that has become a critical gateway to safety for the millions of Ukrainians who have fled westward, trying to escape the worst of the fighting. In late February, it was quickly repurposed from a charming tourist destination into a base of operations for a vast relief effort, serving as a channel for humanitarian supplies, aid workers, foreign fighters making their way to frontline cities and many foreign journalists.Hundreds of thousands of displaced people have passed through the city’s train and bus stations. For many others, it is a new — if fleeting — home. Lviv, which had about 720,000 residents before the war began, has since welcomed at least 350,000 people displaced from other parts of the country.Until Monday, the only direct targets that had been hit in Lviv were a fuel storage site and tank facility in the city’s northeast, hit by several missile strikes about three weeks earlier. Before that, a pair of attacks targeted an airport facility and a military base near Lviv, killing at least 35 people.ImageOn Saturday, passengers, some fleeing eastern Ukraine and heading for Poland and others returning east, crowded the main train station in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesIn Monday’s strike, three missiles hit empty military warehouses while a fourth hit the garage, according to the head of Lviv’s military administration, Maksym Koztyskyy. He did not say whether all the casualties were from the strike on the garage. Besides the seven killed, he said 11 people were injured — a toll that could rise as rescue workers cleared rubble from the site. The missiles, Mr. Koztyskyy said, had been launched by warplanes from the direction of the Caspian Sea.Orest Maznin, a police officer, said he had been driving to work past the garage when the missiles struck, and he narrowly escaped shrapnel. The windshield of his car had a large hole from the impact of a piece of metal.“It happened too quickly for me to be afraid,” Mr. Maznin said.Jane Arraf reported from Lviv, Ukraine, Ivan Nechepurenko from Tbilisi, Georgia, and Mark Landler from London.

261,"LVIV, Ukraine — When war came to Ukraine in February, Helen Polishchuk made some adjustments in the six-story bar she manages in central Lviv.The Mad Bars House in Lviv’s historic central square stayed open, but served coffee and hot food instead of alcoholic drinks. They turned off the rock music. And as displaced Ukrainians began pouring into the city from places devastated by Russian attacks hundreds of miles away, she had instructions for the wait staff.“When guests leave the restaurant we normally say, ‘Have a nice day,’” she said. Instead she told them they could say something else, like “Glory to Ukraine,” or “We wish you blue skies.”“Because to say ‘have a nice day’ in this period is stupid,” said Ms. Polishchuk, 33.Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, Lviv, a historic city just 40 miles from Poland, was a popular European tourist destination, with 2.5 million visitors a year and the biggest jazz festival in Eastern Europe.Now, instead of tourists, there are displaced Ukrainians fleeing the war-torn east of the country. Lviv and its residents are learning to live with what most now believe will be many months of conflict, if not years.ImageCentral Lviv on Saturday.ImageA street artist entertaining children with bubbles last week.ImageThe basement of a maternity hospital after an air-raid siren went off.Several Russian airstrikes have targeted infrastructure here, including a rocket attack on a military training base last month that killed more than 30 people. Air-raid sirens warning of Russian fighter jets breaching the airspace sound several times a day. This small city, though, is still far from the active fighting that has devastated entire cities in the east of Ukraine.The main challenge for Lviv has been to survive a wartime economy and manage the flood of displaced, traumatized people who are swelling the city’s population.“We have learned to live in wartime,” said the city’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, who has recently lifted some municipal restrictions, including allowing bars and restaurants to sell wine and beer, although not hard alcohol.Mr. Sadovyi, a former businessman, said that six months before the Russian invasion, he tasked city officials with finding a way to keep water supplies flowing if the electricity failed. They started buying diesel generators, as well as stockpiling medical supplies, and topping up blood banks.“If I had not been bracing my city for this situation, we would be in a catastrophe right now,” Mr. Sadovyi, dressed in a black hoodie and black sneakers, said in an interview in the 19th-century Viennese-style City Hall. His office’s expansive stone balcony overlooked the market square, where displaced children shrieked with laughter and chased giant soap bubbles blown by a street performer.ImageVolunteers loading relief supplies donated by other European countries at a warehouse.ImageResidents assembling camouflage nets for the Ukrainian Army on Saturday.ImageVictoria Dzyziuk, 18, who runs a cultural hub in Lviv, helping organize clothes donations at a shelter for displaced people.Mr. Sadovyi said that civilians fleeing the fighting started coming into Lviv within hours of the invasion — 60,000 of them per day for the first three weeks. Now, with a new Russian advance expected, about 10,000 a day are arriving.While many are heading across the border to Poland and other European countries, about 200,000 have remained, double the number the city administration was expecting and almost one third the city’s prewar population of 700,000.Those with money are renting apartments or staying in hotels. But tens of thousands more are in shelters, dependent on aid. The Polish government has donated container homes for 1,000 people that are being set up in a city park. Others are being channeled from Lviv to other communities in Western Ukraine.“This is a huge strain on our city,” said Mr. Sadovyi, 53. “Basically we have another city within our city.”ImageA relative mourning Liubomy Gudzeliak, 37, at a funeral for two Ukrainian soldiers in Lviv last week.The war has sparked remarkable patriotism, and if some local residents note that they can no longer find tables at their favorite cafes or restaurants because they are filled with displaced people, they tend not to complain. Guides lead displaced families on free tours of the city. Passengers on the tourist trolley leaving City Hall are not foreigners these days but Ukrainians.It makes for an odd juxtaposition. A significant number of the soldiers dying at the front are from Western Ukraine, and there are regular funerals in churches in the city center.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We reopened because we received so many calls and emails from people,” said Ostap Hromysh, the opera’s international relations manager. The messages were apologetic, saying “of course we understand there is a war,” but asking if they had performances anyway.“If people day by day are faced with sad news about death, about blood, about bombs, they need to feel other emotions,” he said.At the Mad Bars House, Ms. Polishchuk said they planned to open a rooftop terrace next week, perhaps with nonalcoholic cocktails as well as wine and beer. They are bringing back more of their original 111-person staff.She said the bar, which in normal times has a dance floor and serves increasingly potent drinks as patrons ascend its six stories, is losing money, but is committed to remaining open.

Ms. Polishchuk said it was patriotism and stress. “We understand that people want comfort foods,” she said.“Have a nice day” is not the only thing that feels off these days.“This is not the time for carrot juice and green salads,” Ms. Polishchuk said.ImageChildren playing at a memorial to Taras Shevchenko, a 19th-century Ukrainian nationalist, poet and artist.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/world/middleeast/ukraine-lviv-refugees.html
262,"BORODIANKA, Ukraine — The first sign of trouble was when a squad of Chechen soldiers burst through the gate.They jumped from their Jeeps, combat boots hitting the pavement hard, and ordered the 500 patients and staff of Borodianka’s special care home into the courtyard, at gunpoint.“We thought we were going to be executed,” Maryna Hanitska, the home’s director, said in an interview this week.The soldiers pulled out a camera, Ms. Hanitska said, and then barked at her to make everyone smile. Most of the patients were crying.“We command you to say to the camera, ‘Thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,’’’ the soldiers demanded of Ms. Hanitska.With several guns in her face, she said, she quickly ran through her options. She would never thank Russia’s president, whom she had called “a liar” and “a killer.”But she didn’t want the soldiers to hurt anyone. So she managed to utter, “Thank you for not killing us.”And then she fainted.Thus began a nightmarish ordeal at a Ukrainian mental health facility in Borodianka, a small town with a few apartment blocks that lies at a strategic intersection about 50 miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv.ImageMaryna Hanitska, the director of a special care home, spied on the Russian soldiers when she wasn’t scrambling to feed the residents and shepherd them to safety during shelling.In more than a dozen interviews conducted in the past two days in Borodianka and other towns in the devastated areas around Kyiv, villagers described the Russian soldiers as brutal, sadistic, ill-disciplined and juvenile. Their accounts could not be independently verified, but were consistent with other reports and visual evidence about Russian behavior in the region.The siege at the mental health facility dragged on for weeks, during which the building lost heat, water and electricity, and more than a dozen patients lost their lives. What unfolded there represents the depths of despair and at the same time amazing pluck under a brief but harrowing Russian occupation.Throughout the areas of Ukraine recently liberated from a monthlong Russian occupation, a long string of disturbing stories is emerging of terror and death that Russian soldiers inflicted on unarmed Ukrainian civilians under their control.Every day, Ukrainian investigators step into a dank cellar or muddy field or someone’s backyard and discover bodies of villagers who were shot in the head or bear signs of torture. More accounts are surfacing of civilians being held as human shields and some dying from lack of food, water or heat. On Friday, Ukrainian officials said the Russian forces had killed at least 900 civilians as they withdrew from the Kyiv region.Much of this misery was meted out in small towns near Kyiv, where the Russians occupied a large swath in the early days of the war but were driven out two weeks ago by less equipped but much more determined Ukrainian forces.Administrators at Borodianka’s mental health home said that Russian soldiers robbed their pharmacy of rubbing alcohol to drink. Villagers in other places said they stole bedsheets and sneakers, and defaced many of the homes they took over with childish graffiti. Workers at the mental health home also said that on their way out, Russian soldiers scrawled profane messages on the walls — in human excrement.“I threw up when I saw that,” Ms. Hanitska said. “I don’t understand how they were raised, by whom, and who could do this.”VideoThe ruins of the village of Andriivka, west of Kyiv, on Thursday.Lypivka, a blip of a village dwarfed by immense wheat fields, was occupied by Russian soldiers until March 31. Here, villagers said the Russians double crossed them.Some village women had begged Russian commanders for permission to evacuate, and the Russians seemed to agree. So on March 12, a group of older men, women and children piled into 14 cars and slowly began to drive to what they thought would be safety.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.“All of us had white flags and we had permission,” said Valriy Tymchuk, a shopkeeper, who drove a minibus in the convoy.But then Russian armored personnel carriers swiveled their turrets toward them, villagers said. A shell ripped into the first car. And then another. And then another.The convoy turned into a fireball.Mr. Tymchuk said he saw a family of four, including a young child, trapped in their car and engulfed in flames. Many of the singed cars are still on the road. The charred bones of that child are still in the back seat, Mr. Tymchuk said. What appeared to be pieces of bone were scattered among the blackened metal and heaps of ash.Next to the cars lay two dead dogs, their fur singed.Mr. Tymchuk barely escaped after his minibus was hit and shrapnel sliced into his face.He shook his head when asked why he thought the Russians did this.“They are zombies,” he said.ImageA white flag fluttered on an antenna affixed to the top of a civilian car that remained on a road leading out of the village of Lypivka, Ukraine, on Friday.These villages were on the front line, part of Russia’s failed attempt to encircle and capture Kyiv. The same was true of Bucha, another village north of Kyiv and the site of the worst atrocities yet discovered. All these places are quiet now, allowing forensic investigators to do their work. And the more they look, the more they find.In Makariv, another small town near Kyiv, authorities said they recently discovered more than 20 corpses, in different yards and homes, many bearing marks of torture. In the Brovary area, farther east, police officers just found six bodies in a cellar, all men who apparently had been executed.“We have seen bodies with knife wounds and marks of beatings, and some with their hands tied with tape,” said Oleksandr Omelyanenko, a police official in the Kyiv region.“The places hardest hit,” he added, “were occupied the longest.”That was the story for Borodianka and the Borodianka Psychoneurological Nursing Home.Ms. Hanitska, 43 and a former school headmaster, said she watched from the windows of the three-story building as the Russian trucks poured in. She counted 500.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Then, worried about snipers, the Russians began shelling apartment blocks lining the roads, and dozens of residents died under a cascade of rubble, according to emergency service officials.The shock waves rattled the special-needs home, built in the 1970s to provide for adults with neurological and psychological disorders. Ms. Hanitska said some of her patients became aggressive, and three even escaped and have yet to be found. Others were terrified and curled up under their beds and in their closets.“It was more than 10 times scary,” said Ihor Nikolaenko, a patient.ImageRecovery workers digging through rubble in Borodianka, on Thursday.On March 5, it got worse.That’s when the Chechens showed up. Chechen troops are especially dreaded, believed to be more ruthless than other Russians, a consequence of years of their own failed separatist war against Russia’s central government.Ms. Hanitska and other staff members said they could tell the troops were Chechen by their light-colored beards and the language they spoke among themselves. The Ukrainian authorities posted messages on social media in which they referred to the Chechens and warned them not to hurt the patients.“These are mostly sick people with developmental disabilities,” Oleksandr Pavliuk, a senior Ukrainian military official, said in a statement. “But these are our people and we cannot and will never leave them.”By this point, for some people inside, it was too late. Ms. Hanitska said that her first patient died from exposure to the cold in late February. By early March, a half of dozen more passed away. In total, she lost 13.It was 20 degrees Fahrenheit inside the building, even colder outside. There was no heat, no electricity, no running water and little food. Borodianka was under siege, after all.“We started drinking water from the pond,” Ms. Hanitska said. “We all got sick.”The Chechen contingent mysteriously withdrew the same day it arrived, after making the propaganda video, but other Russians took their place.

263,"DEBRECEN, Hungary — The towering memorial, erected on the battlefield where the Russian imperial army routed Hungarian troops, mourns Russia’s 1849 victory over “brave homeland defenders.” It is a reminder of how, for centuries, the Hungarian psyche has been shaped and scarred by the specter of Russian domination.“There has been a constant fear of Russia,” said Gyorgy Miru, a history professor in Debrecen, a Hungarian city near the border with Ukraine where the battle took place.Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, this fear has turned into a trusting embrace. Mr. Orban, a political bruiser who revels in defying what he scorns as liberal conventions, has for years looked to Russia as a reliable source of energy and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, as a beacon of no-nonsense nationalism and muscular leadership, emulating in a milder form the Kremlin’s stranglehold on media and its one-party system.Amid the agonies inflicted on neighboring Ukraine over the past five weeks by Moscow, Mr. Orban’s stance has left many in Hungary and beyond dismayed and angry that a nation with such a long and painful experience of Russian aggression could fall so far out of step with the rest of Europe.Facing an election on Sunday against an unusually united opposition, Mr. Orban has cast himself as a neutral peacemaker who does not want to fan the war by sending weapons to Ukraine or to hurt Hungarian interests by imposing a ban on Russian oil imports.“As a historian, I am surprised and shocked,” Professor Miru said, recalling that Russian troops not only crushed Hungary’s 1848-49 revolt against imperial rule by Austria but also an anti-communist rebellion in 1956.ImageThe memorial in Debrecen remembering Hungarians killed by Russian troops in 1849.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesIn a speech in Budapest on March 15, a national holiday to mark the start of the 1848 revolt, Mr. Orban turned what is usually a solemn occasion into an election rally featuring a call to arms against liberal values and Western solidarity against Russia over Ukraine.He vowed to “stop at Hungary’s border the gender insanity sweeping across the Western world” and to protect Hungarian national interests against the competing interests of Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union. “We must represent our own interests, calmly and bravely,” he said, without mentioning Russia’s invasion.In a speech on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called out Mr. Orban for cozying up to Moscow and refusing to stand with the rest of Europe in opposing the war. “If it’s a war, then I call it a war, not a ‘special operation,’” Mr. Zelensky said. “If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe.”“This is called the honesty that Mr. Orban lacks,” Mr. Zelensky added. “He may have lost it somewhere in his contacts with Moscow.”Mr. Orban has hardly applauded Russia’s military onslaught, which his government describes as “aggression.” But neither has he criticized Mr. Putin nor joined Poland, Britain, Germany and other European countries in helping Ukraine defend itself.ImageIrpin, Ukraine, on Friday. Previous weeks of fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces has damaged the city, which is northwest of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesHis opposition to a ban on Russian oil has infuriated Poland, whose conservative governing party previously stood shoulder to shoulder with Hungary in Europe’s culture wars. It was enough to lead the Czech defense minister, Jana Cernochova, to declare last week that she was “very sorry that cheap Russian oil is now more important to Hungarian politicians than Ukrainian blood.”The Czech minister canceled a trip to Hungary for a planned gathering of the Visegrad Group, comprising four previously close Central European states. Poland and Slovakia, the other scheduled attendees, also stayed away.The leader of Poland’s governing party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Mr. Orban’s closest ally in the European Union, has tried to calm the rift, but even he has expressed dismay at Hungary’s fence-sitting on the war in Ukraine. “We view Hungary’s attitude with criticism, and we hope that it will become more involved,” Mr. Kaczynski told a conservative Polish weekly.Suspicion of Hungary over its ties to Moscow is so intense that some now see Mr. Orban’s nation, a member of NATO since 1999, as a weak link in the alliance.ImageAn exercise with NATO special forces troops in 2019 in Hungary.

This followed an earlier claim by his foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, that the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, recently called Ukraine’s ambassador in Budapest to “consult on the possibility of influencing the election results in Hungary” in cahoots with the opposition.

Then Putin made his move.Fires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.Shelling echoes around Kharkiv after an Easter lull.Mr. Kuleba responded by accusing his Hungarian counterpart of “inventing nonsense” for “short-term benefit before the elections” and “destroying the long-term relationship between us.”Mr. Orban, hailed as a hero by many American conservatives, has taken broad steps in recent years to use his power to erode democratic norms, but his moves to revise election laws to benefit his party and mute critical voices in the media have been especially notable as the vote nears on Sunday. Opinion polls suggest Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party will again win, though it may fall short of the two-thirds majority in Parliament that had allowed Mr. Orban to rewrite the Constitution and turn Hungary into a semi-autocratic state.At a closed-door meeting on Thursday in Slovakia of nine regional foreign ministers, Mr. Szijjarto complained irritably that Hungary had been misunderstood and denied it was siding with Russia, according to a minister who was present.Seeking to rally Mr. Orban’s base ahead of the election, Mr. Szijjarto traveled the previous day to Debrecen and visited a campaign office for the Fidesz party. Asked as he was leaving whether Hungary’s policy toward Russia had left his country isolated, he shouted, “No, no, no,” and rushed out of the building to a waiting limousine.ImageHungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, center, on Wednesday in Debrecen.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesFamous across Hungary as the place where anti-imperial rebels issued Hungary’s declaration of independence in 1849, Debrecen has long been associated with Hungarian nationalism. The city, said Robert Hermann, a leading Hungarian scholar of the 1848 revolution, “is our Philadelphia,” a reference to the city where rebellious American colonies declared their independence from Britain in 1776.Hungary, he added, was never as passionately hostile to Russia as Poland was, in part because Russian troops who fought in Debrecen and other rebel strongholds in the 19th century tended to treat Hungarian captives relatively well. But wariness of Moscow, amplified by its brutal crushing of Hungary’s 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, he said, still runs deep, particularly on the right.Under Mr. Orban, however, “distrust of Russia on the right went into the background,” Mr. Hermann said, as Fidesz, despite its strongly nationalist tinge, embraced a view of Russia that had previously been confined to the left. Describing himself as a “liberal nationalist,” Mr. Hermann said he had been “very confused” by Mr. Orban’s sharp tilt toward Moscow after he took power in 2010.Also confused has been Debrecen University, which in 2017 awarded Mr. Putin the title of “honorary citizen” as part of Hungary’s courtship of the Kremlin. A week after he invaded Ukraine, it issued a statement that avoided criticizing the Russian leader but subtly declared his title void, since he had not visited in person to collect it.ImageUkrainian refugees on Thursday at a shelter in Budapest.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesDespite first making his name as an anti-Moscow firebrand who in 1989 demanded that 80,000 Soviet troops then in Hungary go home, Mr. Orban has repeatedly spoken in recent years of the need to get along with Mr. Putin. In an interview with an Italian newspaper in 2018, he acknowledged that “in the past, we Hungarians have suffered a lot under Russia.” But he added that “it needs to be recognized that Putin has made his country great again” and that he should not be viewed as a devil “with hooves and horns” but as a leader who “rules a great and ancient empire.”Mr. Orban’s outreach to Mr. Putin has been driven in part by close cooperation on energy. Russia lent Hungary $10 billion to finance the construction of a nuclear power plant by a Russian company and provided it with natural gas at favorable prices. But there has also been a political dimension, with Mr. Orban looking to Moscow as an ally in the struggle against progressive ideas seeping in from Western Europe. Like Mr. Putin, Mr. Orban has often spoken about what he sees as the threat posed by gay men, lesbians and transgender people and their advocates.ImageSupporters of Mr. Orban in Szekesfehervar, Hungary, on Friday during the rally.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesWhile Poland has been plastered in recent weeks with Ukrainian flags and other signs of solidarity with its eastern neighbor, streets across Hungary have been decked with placards trumpeting the need to “protect our children.” Alongside a vote on Sunday for Parliament, Hungarians are also being asked to vote on a series of inflammatory questions, like, “Do you support the promotion of sex reassignment therapy for underage children?”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.In early February, as fears mounted of a coming Russian invasion of Ukraine and European leaders warned of severe sanctions if an attack occurred, Mr. Orban visited Moscow to cement his country’s energy ties with Russia. For his efforts, he secured a promise from Mr. Putin that Hungary, unlike other European countries, had no need to worry about running short of natural gas.Mr. Orban described Mr. Putin’s security demands as “normal” and sanctions as pointless. The Russian president returned the favor, telling Mr. Orban that while Russia did not usually take sides in foreign elections: “You have done so much in your work on the Russia track, both in the interest of Hungary and Russia. I hope our cooperation will continue.”After Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Hungary joined fellow members of the European Union in imposing sanctions on Moscow, but it has since refused to let weapons destined for Ukraine pass through its territory and resisted efforts to impose restrictions on Russian energy imports.With television stations and many print outlets controlled directly by the state or by government-friendly tycoons, Hungary’s governing party, Fidesz, has shifted its nationalist base away from its traditional fear of Russia toward the belief that Mr. Putin stands on the same side of the barricades in defending traditional values.ImageOutside the House of Terror, a museum in Budapest focusing on the fascist and communist governments in 20th-century Hungary.

But he said he felt no ill will toward Russia because it “finally has a real, powerful and patriotic leader” who battles to protect children and national interests just as Mr. Orban does.Mr. Tisza said he regretted the bloodshed in Ukraine but, echoing a theme regularly promoted by Fidesz-friendly news media outlets, accused Kyiv of harboring Nazis and restricting the rights of both ethnic Russians and ethnic Hungarians to live in peace.He added that he was not against Ukraine but did not want Hungary to get sucked into its war with Russia. “If my neighbor’s house is on fire,” Mr. Tisza, “should I set my own house on fire, too?”Tomas Dapkus contributed reporting from Vilnius, Lithuania.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/hungary-orban-russia-ukraine.html
264,"WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will work with allies to transfer Soviet-made tanks to bolster Ukrainian defenses in the country’s eastern Donbas region, a U.S. official said on Friday.The decision to act as an intermediary to help transfer the Soviet-made tanks, which Ukrainian troops know how to use, comes in response to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the official said. It marks the first time in the war that the United States has helped transfer tanks.The official said the transfers would begin soon, but declined to say how many tanks would be sent, or from which countries they would come. They will allow Ukraine to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian targets in Donbas, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The tanks’ arrival could be another signal of a new phase in the war, which is five weeks old and has been dominated by Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and installations from the air, and a stalled Russian advance on the ground. Earlier this week, Russian officials indicated that they were refocusing their efforts on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian soldiers since 2014.Mr. Zelensky called on Sunday for NATO allies to provide tanks and planes, in addition to the antitank and antiaircraft weaponry that have become a staple of the arms transfers to Ukraine from the West. Frustrated at what he views as a slow pace of weapons transfers, Mr. Zelensky asked specifically for tanks, in remarks a day after President Biden met with senior Ukrainian officials in Poland.An angry Mr. Zelensky criticized the West for what he called its “Ping-Pong” about weapons transfers. “I’ve talked to the defenders of Mariupol today,” he said, in a reference to the besieged city that has been under an onslaught from Russia for four weeks. “If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1 percent of their courage.”In the past, the Biden administration has taken pains to call the weapons it is providing to Ukraine defensive, and has focused on smaller, easily portable arms. But as the war has progressed, the definition of defensive has become more elastic.Ukraine had already found one source of tanks, capturing at least 161 from Russia on the battlefield, according to the military analysis site Oryx, though Russia has also destroyed a number of Ukrainian tanks. For its part, Russia has captured 43 Ukrainian tanks, according to analysts who study photos and videos on social media.The decision to help transfer the tanks comes as the Ukrainian military has continued to turn back Russia’s ground advance. Pentagon officials have been quick to point out that Russia’s pivot to Donbas and away from capturing Kyiv, the capital, might be a necessity for Moscow after Russian forces stalled out in the central part of the country.On Wednesday, Biden administration officials, citing declassified U.S. intelligence, said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had been misinformed by his advisers about the Russian military’s problems in Ukraine. The intelligence, American officials said, also showed what appeared to be growing tension between Mr. Putin and his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin’s inner circle.Russian officials have disputed the allegations, with the Kremlin on Thursday calling it a “complete misunderstanding” of the situation that could have “bad consequences.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/us-tanks-ukraine.html
265,"President Biden announced another $800 million in military aid to Ukraine on Thursday, saying it sent an “unmistakable message” to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin: “He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.”The latest package brings the U.S. support to the Ukrainians to over $2 billion since the war’s start eight weeks ago. But as Ukraine’s demand increases for more sophisticated arms — everything from helicopters to more advanced antiaircraft systems — American officials are growing cagier about exactly what is being shipped. Mr. Biden made clear that the details of some of the weaponry were being kept secret, presumably because of escalating Russian threats to intercept and destroy it.Modifying Theodore Roosevelt’s famous line, he said the United States would “speak softly and carry a large Javelin,” a reference to the antitank weapon that has been remarkably effective against Russian armor.Mr. Biden made the announcement, appropriately, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, and did his best to put his spin on Russia’s recent advances in the south and east, including its siege of Mariupol, the Ukrainian port that for nearly two months has suffered an unrelenting assault from Russian forces.While reports from the ground suggest that the city is under Russian control except for a steel plant where some Ukrainian forces are still holding out, Mr. Biden said “there is no evidence yet” the city has completely fallen.In fact, there is little hope that Ukrainian forces can hold on to any part of Mariupol, and defenders of the steel plant have acknowledged that they are essentially out of supplies to withstand a blockade. President Volodymyr Zelensky this week sought an exchange to ensure the safe passage for the civilians and troops trapped there.Mr. Biden also announced an accelerated program to allow 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the United States and $500 million in direct economic aid to the Ukrainian government, making official a pledge made several weeks ago.While the White House has announced a series of packages to Ukraine, it is now running out of funds for more — unless Congress acts.In his capacity as president, Mr. Biden can authorize the transfer of military equipment from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency, and Congress earlier this year approved $3 billion in new funding to explicitly encourage Mr. Biden to do so as part of a $13.6 billion proposal approved in March. The package also included funds to shore up sanction enforcement and humanitarian aid, in addition to the defense funds.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said earlier this month that he planned to pursue a bipartisan international aid package, which would include both money for the global vaccination effort and additional funds for Ukraine.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

269,"Ukrainian officials on Thursday met with leaders abroad to call for additional financial support as their country reels from devastating attacks from Russian forces and a disrupted economy.As Ukraine suffers from what he described as “completely destroyed normal economic relations” and widespread destruction, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the World Bank that his country needed up to $7 billion in support per month and that it would need hundreds of billions of dollars to recover from the war.Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Mr. Zelensky said, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses and more than 1,100 educational institutions, as well as hospitals and businesses. An initial analysis found that Ukraine has suffered $550 billion in losses, he said.“Together we are able to implement solutions that will not only stop the aggressive intentions of the Russian Federation, not only support Ukraine in this war, but also inevitably show all the potential aggressors of the world that creating problems for other states, for other nations, means creating problems for themselves,” Mr. Zelensky said, speaking virtually from Ukraine. “Because if we do not do this, millions and millions of people in the world will repeatedly suffer from the aggressive actions of individual states.”In the United States, Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, met with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to call for additional support for his country.Mr. Shmyhal said on Twitter after meeting with Ms. Pelosi that he was “convinced” that Ukraine would receive increased economic, humanitarian and military support. Mr. Shmyhal also joined the World Bank meeting that Mr. Zelensky addressed virtually.In his address, Mr. Zelensky said that five steps were needed to stop Russia from realizing “any of their aggressive goals”: immediate support for Ukraine, excluding Russia from all international financial institutions, creating a special tax on the war, blocking the assets of the “Russian elite,” and national preparations around the globe “for the possible complete severance of any relations with Russia.”“No one should depend on the political mood of the leadership of this state,” Mr. Zelensky said of Russia. “If the world is ready to isolate Russia completely, the Russian leadership will have a motive to avoid any war.”While Russia has been increasingly excluded from the world economy through sanctions and other methods, U.S. officials and foreign leaders have been weighing whether their success in isolating Russia might prompt President Vladimir V. Putin to take even more provocative actions. Such concerns grew on Wednesday when Russia test-launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which Mr. Putin said was a warning to those in the West who “try to threaten our country.”Still, Mr. Zelensky told the World Bank, Russia must “feel punishment for this war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/world/zelensky-ukraine-support.html
270,"Almost six weeks into the war between Russia and Ukraine, I’m beginning to wonder if this conflict isn’t our first true world war — much more than World War I or World War II ever was. In this war, which I think of as World War Wired, virtually everyone on the planet can either observe the fighting at a granular level, participate in some way or be affected economically — no matter where they live.While the battle on the ground that triggered World War Wired is ostensibly over who should control Ukraine, do not be fooled. This has quickly turned into “the big battle” between the two most dominant political systems in the world today: free-market, “rule-of-law democracy versus authoritarian kleptocracy,” the Swedish expert on the Russian economy Anders Aslund remarked to me.Though this war is far from over, and Vladimir Putin may still find a way to prevail and come out stronger, if he doesn’t, it could be a watershed in the conflict between democratic and undemocratic systems. It is worth recalling that World War II put an end to fascism, and that the Cold War put an end to orthodox communism, eventually even in China. So, what happens on the streets of Kyiv, Mariupol and the Donbas region could influence political systems far beyond Ukraine and far into the future.Indeed, other autocratic leaders, like China’s, are watching Russia carefully. They see its economy being weakened by Western sanctions, thousands of its young technologists fleeing to escape a government denying them access to the internet and credible news and its inept army seemingly unable to gather, share and funnel accurate information to the top. Those leaders have to be asking themselves: “Holy cow — am I that vulnerable? Am I presiding over a similar house of cards?”Everyone is watching.In World War I and World War II, no one had a smartphone or access to social networks through which to observe and participate in the war in nonkinetic ways. Indeed, a large chunk of the world’s population was still colonized and did not have the full freedom to express independent views, even if they had the technology. Many of those residing outside the war zones were also extremely poor subsistence farmers who were not so heavily affected by those first two world wars. There weren’t the giant connected globalized and urbanized lower and middle classes of today’s wired world.Now, anyone with a smartphone can view what is happening in Ukraine — live and in color — and express opinions globally through social media. In our post-colonial world, governments from virtually every country around the globe can vote to condemn or excuse one side or another in Ukraine through the U.N. General Assembly.While estimates vary, it appears that between three billion and four billion people on the planet — almost half — have a smartphone today, and although internet censorship remains a real problem, particularly in China, there are just so many more people able to peer deeply into so many more places. And that’s not all.Anyone with a smartphone and a credit card can aid strangers in Ukraine, through Airbnb, by just reserving a night at their home and not using it. Teenagers anywhere can create apps on Twitter to track Russian oligarchs and their yachts. And the encrypted instant messaging app Telegram — which was invented by two Russian-born techie brothers as a tool to communicate outside the Kremlin’s earshot — “has emerged as the go-to place for unfiltered live war updates for both Ukrainian refugees and increasingly isolated Russians alike,” NPR reported. And it’s run out of Dubai!Meanwhile, Ukraine’s government has been able to tap a whole new source of funding — raising more than $70 million worth of cryptocurrency from individuals around the world after appealing on social media for donations. And the Tesla billionaire Elon Musk activated his SpaceX company’s satellite broadband service in Ukraine to provide high-speed internet after a Ukrainian official tweeted at him for help from Russian efforts to disconnect Ukraine from the world.Commercial U.S.-based satellite companies, like Maxar Technologies, have enabled anyone to view from space hundreds of desperate people lining up for food outside a supermarket in Mariupol — even though the Russians have the town surrounded on the ground and have banned any journalists from entering.Then there are the cyberwarriors who can jump into the fight from anywhere — and have. CNBC reported that “a popular Twitter account named ‘Anonymous’ declared that the shadowy activist group was waging a ‘cyber war’ against Russia.” The account, which has more than 7.9 million global followers — almost eight times as many as Russia’s whole army (including some 500,000 new Anonymous followers since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) — “has claimed responsibility for disabling prominent Russian government, news and corporate websites and leaking data from entities such as Roskomnadzor, the federal agency responsible for censoring Russian media.”Such nongovernmental, super-empowered, global players and platforms were not present in World War I or II.But just as so many more people can affect this war, so, too, can more be affected by it. Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of wheat and fertilizer to the agricultural supply chains that now feed the world and that this war has disrupted. A war between just two countries in Europe has spiked the price of food for Brazilians, Indians and Africans.And because Russia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of natural gas, crude oil and the diesel fuel used by farmers in their tractors, the sanctions on Russia’s energy infrastructure are curbing its exports, causing gasoline pump prices to rise from Minneapolis to Mexico to Mumbai, and forcing farmers as far away as Argentina to ration their diesel-powered tractor usage or cut fossil-fuel-rich fertilizer usage, jeopardizing Argentina’s agriculture exports and adding further to soaring world food prices.There’s another unexpected financial globalization angle on this war that you really need to keep your eye on: Putin saved up over $600 billion in gold, foreign government bonds and foreign currency, earned from all of Russia’s energy and mineral exports, precisely so he would have a cushion if he were sanctioned by the West. But Putin apparently forgot that in today’s wired world, as is standard practice, his government had deposited most of it in the banks of Western countries and China.According to the Atlantic Council GeoEconomics Center, the top six nations where Russian central bank foreign currency assets are stowed by percentage are: China, 17.7 percent; France, 15.6 percent; Japan, 12.8 percent; Germany, 12.2 percent; U.S., 8.5 percent; and Britain, 5.8 percent. Also, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have 6.4 percent.Each of these countries, except China, has now frozen the Russian reserves it is holding — so around $330 billion is inaccessible to Putin, according to the Atlantic Council’s tracker. But not only can the Russian state not touch those reserves to prop up its crumbling economy, there will be a huge global push to tap this money to pay reparations to rebuild the Ukrainian homes, apartment buildings, roads and government structures the Russian Army destroyed in Putin’s war of choice.Message to Putin: “Thanks for banking with us. It will be legally difficult to seize your savings for reparations, but you’d better get your lawyers ready.”For all these reasons, all of those leaders around the world who have drifted toward some version or another of Putin-inspired authoritarian capitalism or kleptocracy have to be worried, though they will not be easily dislodged no matter what happens in Russia.These regimes have become adept at using new surveillance technologies to control political opponents and information flows and to manipulate their politics and state financial resources to keep themselves ensconced in power. We are talking about Turkey, Myanmar, China, North Korea, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary and several Arab states. Putin was surely hoping that a second Trump term might transform America into a version of this kind of strongman kleptocracy and tip the whole global balance his way.Then came this war. To be sure, Ukraine’s democracy is frail and the country has had its own serious issues with oligarchs and corruption. Kyiv’s burning aspiration, though, was not to join NATO but to join the European Union, and it was in the process of cleaning itself up to do just that.That’s what really triggered this war. Putin was never going to let a Slavic Ukraine become a successful free-market democracy in the E.U. next door to his stagnating Slavic Russian kleptocracy. The contrast would have been intolerable for him, and that is why he is trying to erase Ukraine.But Putin, it turns out, had no clue what world he was living in, no clue about the frailties of his own system, no clue how much the whole free, democratic world could and would join the fight against him in Ukraine, and no clue, most of all, about how many people would be watching.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Russia said a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine could occur once a draft peace agreement was ready, though analysts said such talk may be just a tactic.The development comes as Russia is losing ground in the northeast and around the capital: A Ukrainian counteroffensive has pushed back Russian forces around Irpin, a strategic suburb, though Kyiv remains in play. Here’s the latest.Ukraine also outlined for the first time potential concessions over territory that it is all but certain to have lost. It proposed a 15-year process of negotiations on the status of Crimea, opened the floor to negotiations over separatist regions and prepared to declare a permanent neutral status.History: The Times’s Carlotta Gall covered the rebellion in Chechnya nearly 30 years ago. In Kyiv, she sees echoes in Russia’s brutal siege tactics and targeting of civilians.Tactics: Russian forces are using hunger as a weapon in the siege of Mariupol.State of the war:Despite the diplomatic movement, fighting continued on several fronts.A Russian attack destroyed much of a regional government building in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, killing at least nine people.Ukrainian officials said there are growing reports of sexual violence involving Russian soldiers.Other developments:Oil prices dropped and stock prices jumped as peace talks showed signs of progress.Researchers have cast doubt over the legitimacy of rising pro-Russian posts on Indian Twitter.ImagePeople lined up for eggs in Shanghai on Monday.Credit...Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLockdowns rile ShanghaiShanghai, China’s largest, wealthiest city, has put a staggered lockdown in place to curb an Omicron surge. Officials had tried isolating only specific buildings or neighborhoods, but decided that wasn’t enough.The measures have closed nonessential businesses, stopped public transit and kept many people at home. A five-day quarantine in Shanghai’s eastern section will be followed by a similar shutdown in the western portion. Mass testing is planned during the lockdowns.But patience is stretched thin, and if all of China goes into Covid-zero mode again, Shanghai could be the canary in the coal mine. Citizens have protested over inconsistencies in how restrictions are applied, and say the government has done little to help.

Faced with life-threatening hunger, they are desperate to scrape out a living amid a ruined economy.But the mines are deadlier than ever: Unlike the previous government, the Taliban have not supplied engineers, toxic-gas monitors or timber to support tunnels.

His system involves 13 body types based on Old Hollywood archetypes and a balance between what Kibbe calls “yin” (softness, curve) and “yang” (sharp angles, edges).There are critiques of the system, such as its frequent failure to “account for body diversity across gender and race,” Terry Nguyen writes in Vox. Still, Kibbe types have grown in popularity online. Like an astrology sign or Myers-Briggs personality type, a Kibbe body type can also be a social identifier.“I think people are drawn to it because they no longer feel stuck in the loop of trend after trend,” a 19-year-old design student said. “They’re getting cemented in actually understanding themselves.”PLAY, WATCH, EATWhat to CookImageCredit...Sang An for The New York Times.

272,"Over the past 40 years, Vladimir Sorokin’s work has punctured nearly every imaginable political and social taboo in Russia.His novel “Blue Lard,” which features a graphic sex scene between clones of Stalin and Khrushchev, drew a criminal investigation over charges that he was selling pornography. Pro-Kremlin activists accused him of promoting cannibalism and tried to ban his novella “Nastya,” a grisly allegory about a girl who is cooked and eaten by her family. Protesters placed a giant sculpture of a toilet in front of the Bolshoi Theater and threw his books in it, a fecal metaphor that Sorokin said reminded him of “one of my own stories.”With every attack, Sorokin has only grown bolder, and more popular.“A Russian writer has two options: Either you are afraid, or you write,” he said in an interview last month. “I write.”Sorokin is widely regarded as one of Russia’s most inventive writers, an iconoclast who has chronicled the country’s slide toward authoritarianism, with subversive fables that satirize bleak chapters of Soviet history, and futuristic tales that capture the creeping repression of 21st-century Russia. But despite his reputation as both a gifted postmodern stylist and an unrepentant troublemaker, he remains relatively unknown in the West. Until recently, just a handful of his works had been published in English, in part because his writing can be so challenging to translate, and so hard to stomach. Now, four decades into his scandal-scorched career, publishers are preparing to release eight new English-language translations of his books.The attention comes as his portraits of Russia as a decaying former empire that’s sliding backward under a militaristic, violent and repressive regime have come to seem tragically prescient. As Russia carries out its brutal invasion of Ukraine, Sorokin sees the conflict not just as a military onslaught, but as a semantic war being waged through propaganda and lies — an assault on truth that writers must combat.“The role of writers is going to change, given the current situation,” Sorokin said. “If a new era of censorship begins, writers’ words will only be stronger.”ImageSorokin compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to “killing your own mother,” and said the war has recalled a frequent theme of his: humanity’s capacity for violence.Credit...Zoë Noble for The New York TimesIn conversation, Sorokin — who is 66, with wavy silver hair and a placid demeanor that give him the air of a hermit or a sage — is soft-spoken and reflective, not quite the brash, polarizing figure he’s frequently cast as.Speaking from Germany, he seemed disoriented, but not surprised, to find himself facing what could be a long exile. He and his wife Irina, who split their time between Vnukovo, a town outside of Moscow, and a bright, art-filled apartment in Berlin, left Russia just three days before the invasion of Ukraine. Though the timing of their trip was pure coincidence, it felt fated, and Sorokin is wary of returning to Russia as long as Putin remains in power. He has denounced the invasion publicly and called Vladimir Putin a crazed “monster,” putting himself in a precarious position after Putin labeled Russians who oppose the war as “scum” and “traitors.”Watching the crushing use of force in Ukraine, Sorokin, who compared the Russian invasion to “killing your own mother,” has been reminded of his preoccupation with humanity’s bottomless capacity for violence, a constant theme in his work.“Why can’t mankind get by without violence?” he said. “I grew up in a country where violence was the main air that everyone breathed. So when people ask me why there’s so much violence in my books, I tell them that I was absolutely soaked and marinated in it from kindergarten onward.”“His Books Are Like Entering a Crazy Nightmare”Sorokin doesn’t fit the classic mold of a dissident writer. While he’s been critical of Putin’s regime, he’s hard to pinpoint, stylistically or ideologically. He’s been pilloried for violating Russian Orthodox Christian values in his stories, but is a devout Christian. He deploys gorgeous prose to describe horrifying acts. He’s celebrated as a literary heir to giants like Turgenev, Gogol and Nabokov, but at times, he’s questioned the value of literature, dismissing novels as “just paper with typographic signs.”He’s a master of mimicry and subverting genre tropes, veering from arch postmodern political satire (“The Queue”) to esoteric science fiction (“The Ice Trilogy”) to alternate histories and futuristic cyberpunk fantasies (“Telluria”).ImageCredit....Image“His books are like entering a crazy nightmare, and I mean that as a compliment,” the novelist Gary Shteyngart said. “He was able to find the right vocabulary with which to articulate the truth.”The translations arriving this year reveal the dizzying strangeness of Sorokin’s work, and reflect his obsession with the horrors of Russia’s past and his anxiety over where the country is headed. The first, “Their Four Hearts,” out this month from Dalkey Archive Press, follows four archetypal Soviet heroes who are subjected to grotesque degradations as part of a savage mission that culminates in them being compressed into cubes and rolled like dice onto a frozen lake made of liquefied human remains. Sorokin wrote the novel in 1991, as the Soviet Union fell apart. It was so controversial that incensed workers at a printing plant refused to produce copies.The second book, “Telluria,” coming out in August from NYRB Classics, is a dystopian fable set in the near future, as Europe has devolved into medieval feudal states and people are addicted to a drug called tellurium. Through the smokescreen of a twisted fantasy teeming with centaurs, robot bandits and talking dogs who eat corpses, Sorokin smuggles in a sly critique of contemporary Russia’s turn toward totalitarianism.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 24, 2022, 12:32 p.m. ETRussian forces bombard Ukraine, ignoring calls for a cease-fire during the Orthodox Easter holiday.A mother had found ‘a new level of happiness’ when her daughter was born.

Until recently, just a handful of his works had been published in English, in part because his writing can be so challenging to translate — and so hard to stomach.Credit...Zoë Noble for The New York TimesIt’s something of a grim coincidence that the new translations are arriving at a moment when Russian writers are fearful of another wave of repression — a threat that reminds Sorokin of his early days as an underground Soviet author.“It’s been possible to write whatever you want in Russia, so long as it’s not a direct description of Putin or the leadership,” he said. “But I don’t know how it’s going to be. Maybe there will be literary censorship now. Maybe it will just be a kind of déjà vu. If that happens, then I’ll be returned to the time of my youth.”“A Master of Making Fun of the Regime”Growing up in a town outside Moscow, where his father worked as a professor of metallurgy, Sorokin had an early taste of literary notoriety. As a schoolboy, he discovered he could make money by writing erotic stories and selling them to classmates. He studied petroleum engineering at the Moscow Institute of Oil and Gas, but was drawn to visual art, and found work as a cartoonist for a Communist youth journal, then as a children’s book illustrator and as a graphic designer. In the early 1980s, he became a fixture of Moscow’s underground literary world, and wrote his first novel, “The Queue,” an absurdist sendup of Soviet bureaucracy and oppression that unfolds as snippets of dialogue between people waiting in a line for hours to buy unknown goods.“I just wanted one thing, which was that the K.G.B. not get ahold of my text,” Sorokin said.When it was published in France in 1985, “The Queue” earned Sorokin a reputation as a slippery provocateur. It wasn’t released in Russia until after the collapse of the Soviet Union.“He was such a master of making fun of the regime,” said Masha Gessen, a Russian American author and writer for The New Yorker. “He really saw the Soviet regime as ridiculous and by extension, the explicit confrontation with it as absurd.”ImageIn the early 1980s, Sorokin joined Moscow’s literary underground. “I just wanted one thing, which was that the K.G.B. not get ahold of my text,” he said of his first novel, “The Queue.”Over the next decade, Sorokin wrote a series of experimental books that explored how language and meaning were weaponized by Soviet authorities. In “The Norm,” which came out in the early 1990s, Sorokin deployed a crude metaphor for state-spun propaganda: citizens are required to ingest packages of a foul-smelling brown fecal substance that the government distributes.“He was saying to the totalitarian state that the domain of meaning is not yours, it doesn’t belong to you, and he took it from the state in a very powerful gesture,” said Nariman Skakov, an associate professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Harvard University.In the early 2000s, Sorokin grew alarmed by the erosion of civil liberties and growing isolationism under Putin, which he saw as a return to the brutality of medieval Russia.Those observations spurred him to write his most overtly political book, “Day of the Oprichnik,” which is set in a near-future Russia that has lapsed into a Tsarist dictatorship.“I saw some signs of change in Russian society that smelled like the Middle Ages,” Sorokin said. “When I wrote it, a lot of critics said, well you must have had a pretty bad hangover to write this. Then a few years passed and they stopped laughing and they began to smell this medieval odor in their normal lives too.”“The World is Changing So Unpredictably”In the years since, Sorokin has expanded on his vision of a futuristic “new medieval” Russia that has become more authoritarian, militaristic and backward, in a series of books that include “The Sugar Kremlin,” “Telluria” and “Manaraga.” During the pandemic, he finished the most recent novel in his medieval cycle, “Doctor Garin.”Set in a futuristic dystopia blighted by nuclear war, military dictatorships and a rogue race of genetically altered super soldiers, the novel follows a doctor who works in a sanitarium and tends to a group of small, bizarrely shaped “political beings,” a cohort that includes deformed mini-versions of Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Putin, who is referred to as Vladimir and is only capable of uttering, “It isn’t me.” Like much of Sorokin’s work, it’s impossible to categorize — a wild mash-up of cyberpunk, fantasy, satire and sci-fi, dotted with snippets of diary entries and Soviet-era dissident literature.ImageSorokin in his studio. His canvases can be as surreal and gleefully obscene as his fiction. One living room wall had a portrait of his hero, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, floating in outer space, ejaculating.Credit...Zoë Noble for The New York TimesSorokin says he’s drawn to futuristic, fantastical settings because they feel like the most accurate lens to examine the chaos and instability of the present.“The world is changing so unpredictably that classical realistic prose isn’t able to catch up to it,” he said. “It’s like shooting at a bird that’s already flown away.”“This is why I prefer complicated optics,” he continued. “In order to see what is real, you need two telescopes.”He switched to English, and added slowly: “One from the past and another from the future.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/books/vladimir-sorokin-russia-ukraine.html

274,"PARIS — When Europe’s far-right leaders gathered in Madrid in January, they had no problem finding unity on the issues they hold dear, whether cracking down on immigrants or upholding “European Christian ideals.” But as Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border, they were divided on one issue: the threat posed by President Vladimir V. Putin.Marine Le Pen, the extreme-right challenger for the French presidency, objected to a paragraph in the final statement calling for European solidarity to confront “Russian military actions on the eastern border of Europe.” Even in a gathering of illiberal nationalists, she was an outlier in her fealty to Mr. Putin.Now, on her campaign website, the leaders’ statement appears with that paragraph cut in an unacknowledged change to the text. This little subterfuge is consistent with an embrace of Mr. Putin so complete that even his ravaging of Ukraine has hardly diminished it.Over the past decade, Ms. Le Pen’s party, the National Rally, formerly the National Front, has borrowed millions from a Russian bank, and Ms. Le Pen has supported Mr. Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, as well as his incendiary meddling that year in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where just this week Russia redoubled its offensive.Her support for Mr. Putin is one thing in a time of peace and another in a time of war. Russia, a nuclear power, has invaded a European state, and Ms. Le Pen is closer than ever to her cherished goal of becoming president of France, having narrowed the gap with President Emmanuel Macron before the decisive round of the election on Sunday.ImageSupporters of Ms. Le Pen at a campaign rally in Stiring-Wendel, France, on April 1.

Trump’s victory in 2016. As in Britain and the United States, alienation and economic hardship have fed a French readiness to gamble on nationalist dreams.If Ms. Le Pen wins, which is not likely but possible, her victory will almost certainly fracture the allied unity engineered by President Biden in an attempt to defeat Mr. Putin. It would hand Mr. Putin by far his most important ally in Europe, one he could leverage in his aims to divide Europe from the United States and fracture Europe’s decades-old project of unity.France, a core member of the European Union and NATO, is suddenly the possible soft underbelly of the West.Julien Nocetti, a Russia expert at the French Institute of International Relations, said there was “a complete ideological alignment between Putin and Le Pen” — one that would be deeply worrying to France’s American and European allies.The Ukraine war has caused Ms. Le Pen to pivot a little by saying Mr. Putin crossed “a red line” with the invasion, but she still says her foreign-policy priority is a rapprochement with Russia once the fighting stops.ImageBodies being loaded onto a truck in Bucha, Ukraine, where evidence of Russian atrocities mounted. Ms. Le Pen said that Mr. Putin crossed “a red line” with the invasion but also that she will seek a rapprochement with Russia.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesSince Ms. Le Pen, 53, took over the leadership of her party in 2011, she has only deepened its Putin predilection, making four trips to Moscow and one to Crimea. She would support sanctions against Russia, she says, but not cutting off imports of Russian oil and gas, which she has equated with economic death for France.“We have to think of our people,” she said in a recent TV interview, a position consistent with the strong focus on pocketbook issues that has propelled her campaign. The majority of French people are more focused on getting to the end of the month than getting Russia out of Ukraine.Certainly, Ms. Le Pen vaunted her connection with Mr. Putin until he went to war on Feb. 24. She included a photo of herself shaking hands with him in her election brochure as evidence of her “international stature.” This handout disappeared abruptly from view after the Russian invasion.The photo was taken at the Kremlin on March 24, 2017. That was less than five weeks before the first round of the last presidential election, in which Mr. Macron defeated Ms. Le Pen by 66.1 percent to 33.9 percent. The National Rally leader said then that she would immediately review lifting “unjust” sanctions against Russia if elected.As for Mr. Putin, he said with a knowing smirk that Russia did “not want to influence events in any way.”ImageShopping at a supermarket in Livry-Gargan, Paris, in December. Most French voters are more concerned about the economy than the Ukraine war.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesJean-Maurice Ripert, the French ambassador in Moscow from 2013 to 2017, said in an interview that a fellow European ambassador, a close friend, had asked the Russian leader after the French election why he had backed Ms. Le Pen.“Because I had been told she was going to win,” Mr. Putin said.Certainly that is what he wanted. Ms. Le Pen, committed to “equidistance” between great powers and hostile to “America’s protectorate on European soil,” sees in Mr. Putin the defender of the nation-state, family and Christianity against border-eroding multilateralism and irreligious cultural decay.“It’s all about sovereignty,” said Marlène Laruelle, the French director of the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian studies at George Washington University. “The sovereign state against international organizations; the sovereign traditional family against L.G.B.T.Q. rights.”Then there is the money. Unable to get a loan from French banks, Ms. Le Pen and several of her top aides scrambled for cash in Russia, accepting a 9.4 million euro loan, then $12.2 million, at a 6 percent interest rate, from the First Czech-Russian Bank in September 2014. It was supposed to be repaid by 2019.ImageA branch of the First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow, before it collapsed in 2016. Ms. Le Pen received millions in loans from the bank.Credit...Dmitry Serebryakov/TASS/Alamy Live NewsWallerand de Saint-Just, who was long the National Rally’s treasurer before leaving the position last year, negotiated the deal in Moscow. In a written answer to a question as to why French banks had refused any loan to the National Rally, he said “My experience with the six big French banking groups is that they obey orders from the political executive.”But given the lack of transparency and accountability in Russia’s financial sector — and Mr. Putin’s sway over it in his pay-to-play system — the sum has long raised hard questions of just how beholden Ms. Le Pen actually is to the Russian president, and whether some of her outspoken backing for him has been a consequence.I asked Ms. Le Pen this month at a news conference whether the outstanding loan did not create at least the impression of dependence on Russia, a liability for any future president?“Absolutely not,” she said. “I am totally independent of any link to any power.”In her current campaign, again unable to get a loan from a French bank, Ms. Le Pen turned to Hungary, where Viktor Orban, the anti-immigrant Hungarian prime minister, has been in power for 12 years. A Hungarian bank has now lent the National Rally another $11.4 million, so if she were to win she would be indebted to both Mr. Putin and Mr. Orban.ImageHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, center, attending a meeting of far-right and conservative leaders in Madrid, in January.Credit...Oscar Del Pozo/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAlready her backing of Mr. Putin has been borderline fawning. Ms. Le Pen visited Moscow and Crimea in June 2013; Moscow in April 2014; and Moscow again in May 2015. She was received by the president of the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia’s Parliament, during the first of these visits, and sprinkled her Russian sojourns with pro-Putin remarks.In 2013, she blamed the European Union for a new “Cold War on Russia.” In 2015, also while in Moscow, she criticized France’s pro-American stance and suggested this would change “in 2017 with Marine Le Pen as president.” In 2021, she recommended Russia’s uncertain Sputnik vaccine for the coronavirus, saying “our anti-Russian ideology should not ruin our capacity to vaccinate our fellow citizens.”The 2014 visit came at a particularly delicate moment, given the Crimea annexation. It was one of several demonstrations of support for Mr. Putin from prominent members of Ms. Le Pen’s party who visited Crimea that year, and the Donbas, the Ukrainian region where clashes kindled by Moscow had begun.Among them was Aymeric Chauprade, her former top diplomatic adviser, who went to Crimea to observe the dubious March 2014 referendum that massively backed the Russian annexation. A United Nations General Assembly resolution declared the vote invalid.“It was the West that began changing European borders with Kosovo’s independence in 2008,” Mr. Chauprade, who has since left the National Rally, said in an interview. “There was an openness to accepting invitations from Russia, a good atmosphere.”ImageRussian troops guarded a Ukrainian marine base in Crimea as Mr. Putin moved to annex the peninsula in March 2014. Le Pen has visited Moscow and Crimea and made remarks that were supportive of Russia.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesMediapart, a French investigative news website, was the first to expose the Russian loan to the National Rally in September 2014. In an earlier interview with Mediapart, Mr. Chauprade said visits to the Donbas that year and in 2015 by Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, a former National Rally member of the European Parliament, had been a “quid pro quo” for the loan.“Going to the Donbas amounted to strong support for Russia,” he said.Mr. Schaffhauser did not respond to a request for comment.I asked Mr. Chauprade whether the loan was indeed a “quid pro quo.” He said that while there was an “inclination to help,” there was “no conditionality.”The Russian loan, whatever the strings, has had a convoluted history.Shortly after the First Czech-Russian bank collapsed in 2016, the National Rally loan was acquired by Aviazapchast, a private Russian company that in Soviet times was part of the aviation ministry, supporting Soviet aircraft operating abroad.On its website, Aviazapchast describes its main activities as “supply of aviation technical equipment and civil and dual-use material as well as repair of aircraft.”ImageWorkers in Crimea placed a billboard reading “Together With Russia” before the referendum on joining the Russian Federation in 2014.

Ivanovic, who served in the Russian armed forces from 1983 to 1996. A former deputy general director, Yevgeny N.

That is the only obligation of my movement,” she said.It is possible that the exercise of power, if she is elected, would attenuate Ms. Le Pen’s long-held pro-Putin, anti-NATO positions, especially if Mr. Putin prosecutes the war in Ukraine with relentless brutality.ImageMs. Le Pen has said that if elected she would withdraw France from the integrated military command of NATO.Credit...Andrea Mantovani for The New York TimesLast week, however, she said that she would withdraw France from the integrated military command of NATO, a technical step with powerful symbolism at a moment when NATO’s original mission to defend a free Europe against Moscow has been revived.America’s alliance with France, one of its oldest, has been put to many tests over the centuries. But all the evidence suggests that a France governed by Ms. Le Pen would pose enormous problems for President Biden just when he needs his nuclear-armed ally most.One core issue is how free Ms. Le Pen would really be when it comes to Russia. “If Ms. Le Pen is still reimbursing, she is not free, she’s dependent,” said Sylvie Bermann, who succeeded Mr. Ripert as French ambassador to Russia in 2017.Mr. Saint-Just, the former National Rally treasurer, had another explanation of Ms. Le Pen’s Russia policy. “She believes in balance and equidistance. She has always had in her head a phrase of General de Gaulle: ‘In foreign affairs, France has no friends, only interests.’ ”Adèle Cordonnier contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/world/europe/le-pen-putin-france-election.html
275,"Perhaps it was the way the lifeless bodies, bloodied by bullets, and some with hands bound, had been left strewn about or shoveled into makeshift mass graves. Or the reality of seeing them up close in widely circulated photographs and videos.There have been other atrocities in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, concentrating much of its firepower on the dwellings and gathering spots of ordinary Ukrainians, but the international outrage they provoked has been eclipsed by the reaction to revelations that retreating Russian soldiers left many slain civilians behind near the Ukrainian capital.Some of the bodies found this past weekend outside Kyiv were face down, and some curled up. Civilians appear to have been killed on their bicycles, while walking down the street, or in the basements of homes. In Bucha, where many of the dead were discovered, three bodies were found in a garden.Many of the victims had been shot in the head. A coroner in Bucha said his team had collected dozens. The Russians fired at anyone as their tanks rolled through the town in the war’s early days, some residents said.Russian officials denied responsibility, dismissing the photographs of bodies as fabricated, but satellite images taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha and other towns belied their claims.An analysis of the satellite images by The New York Times showed dots in the exact coordinates where the bodies were later found in the newly liberated areas by Ukrainian forces and journalists. That corroborated the accounts of witnesses who said many had lain there for weeks.VideoSatellite images rebut Russia’s claim that the killing of civilians in Bucha occurred after its soldiers had left town, a Times analysis found. Video contains graphic images.CreditCredit...Maxar TechnologiesThe summary killings of civilians add to the growing body of evidence of numerous flagrant violations by Russian forces of the laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions and the International Criminal Court’s definitions of what constitutes a war crime.Prosecutors in war-crime cases have a steep hill to climb. But experts in international law say the distressing images of civilians shot to death in Bucha and other towns vacated by the Russians, along with the accounts of eyewitnesses, could provide a trove of documentation for investigations.Unlike other horrors of the Ukraine war, like the bombing of a maternity hospital, the flattening of a theater where people were sheltering, or the shelling of apartment houses, the killings in Bucha could not be cast as unintentional damage or easily denied by the Russians as propaganda.“What’s different here is that you have images of civilians with their hands bound and executed — that’s a completely different kind of crime,” said Alex Whiting, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who has worked on international war crimes prosecutions. “This very much looks like a crime.”Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, which has been gathering evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, said the killings have generated so much shock in part because many of the other civilian deaths in the war have been caused by indiscriminate shelling and bombing — although that is no less an atrocity.“I think one of the reasons people are having a different reaction to these bodies on the ground is the suspicion that these victims weren’t indiscriminate, they were deliberate,” she said.When Russia began the invasion on Feb. 24, there were widespread expectations that its superior strength would quickly subjugate Ukraine. But when they met fierce Ukrainian resistance, the Russians soon resorted to large-scale bombings and missile barrages, making little or no distinction between civilian and military targets, and leveling all or parts of some cities and towns.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.In some ways, legal experts said, the imagery of civilians shot at close range conveys a more personal malevolence.“I suppose at one level, one sees a town destroyed, one thinks this sort of thing happens in war,” said Andrew Clapham, a professor of international law at the Geneva Graduate Institute, who is among those advising Ukraine’s government. “People sort of suspend their horror and say it might be explicable in wartime.”But the deaths outside Kyiv, he said, showed an intent to kill civilians.“It’s much more obvious that there’s no excuse,” Mr. Clapham said.Here is a geographical breakdown of where some of the worst atrocities in the war in Ukraine have been reported:ImageA woman injured in a Russian missile strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month later died, as did her baby.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressMariupolThe southeast port, one of the first targets of the Russian invasion, has been under siege for weeks, with little food, water or power, and its onetime population of 450,000 has by some estimates shrunk to 100,000 or less. A March 9 missile strike by Russia severely damaged a maternity hospital, leaving an undetermined number of casualties. A March 16 Russian bombing destroyed the Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians had sought shelter and where the word “children” had been written in large letters outside to dissuade aerial attackers. Ukrainian officials said 300 people inside were killed. On March 21, Ukrainian officials said the Russians had moved up to 4,500 Mariupol residents into Russian territory — which, if confirmed as a forced relocation, would be a potential war crime.ImageA destroyed school in Kharkiv in February.Credit...Sergey Bobok/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesKharkivThe city of 1.5 million in eastern Ukraine, the country’s second largest, has been subjected to Russian aerial attacks from missiles, artillery and cluster munitions, widely banned weapons that spread bomblets over a wide area. According to residents and videos verified by The New York Times, the Kharkiv destruction has included elementary schools and residences. Ukrainian officials recently estimated that at least 500 people had been killed. And Human Rights Watch, in a report Sunday on potential war crimes in Ukraine, said it had documented at least one instance of rape by Russian soldiers in the Kharkiv region on March 13.ImageA residential building damaged by shelling last month in Chernihiv.Credit...Roman Zakrevskyi/ReutersChernihivThe northern city near the border with Belarus was a temporary haven for many civilians who sought to escape Russia’s early drive to encircle Kyiv. But Russian forces subjected Chernihiv to relentless aerial assaults as well, after Ukrainian defenders prevented the invaders from taking that city. Witnesses in Chernihiv said the Russian attacks destroyed schools, damaged hospitals and hit civilians waiting in bread lines.ImageAnna Smetana, a caretaker at an orphanage, said she was traveling with colleagues from Mykolaiv to a nearby town when Russian forces opened fire on their van.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesMykolaivThe southern industrial city of 500,000, which blocks the Russian military’s pathway to the Black Sea port of Odesa, has withstood several Russian advances and aerial attacks. One destroyed a marine military barracks that killed dozens, others were more indiscriminate. Missile assaults have slammed into residential apartment buildings. And last week, a missile strike hit a government building, killing at least 36 people. Over the weekend and on Monday, other deadly attacks were reported on vehicles and homes in and around the city.ImageResidents of Bucha with the body of a civilian on Saturday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesKyiv SuburbsMany bodies of civilians have been found in suburbs north of Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday in his nightly address that more than 300 had been tortured and killed in Bucha alone, and that the list was likely to grow. In its report on Sunday, Human Rights Watch chronicled the summary execution of one Bucha man on March 4 by Russian soldiers and the killing of a mother and her 14-year-old daughter in another northern town, Vorzel, a few days later.Sexual violence by the Russian occupiers has also been reported. Last month, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said in a Facebook post that a Russian soldier had killed an unarmed civilian and then repeatedly raped his wife in a Kyiv suburb. Laura A. Dickinson, a professor at George Washington University Law School who specializes in international law, said the photographs of bodies in the Kyiv suburbs offered some of the most compelling signs that atrocities have been committed by the Russian side, regardless of the Kremlin’s denials.“The evidence is quite damning, I would say,” she said. “It’s hard to dismiss as fake.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-atrocities.html

277,"At least eight people were killed when two cruise missiles struck a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of the Black Sea port city of Odesa on Saturday, Ukrainian officials said. Given the extent of the damage, officials said the number of victims was certain to climb.“There will be more,” Sergei Nazarov, an aide to Odesa’s mayor, said in a text message.He said the missiles struck a residential neighborhood in the Tairove district in the far west of the city. Photographs and video from the scene, including those posted to the city government’s Telegram channel, appeared to show extensive damage to a large housing complex, which was partially obscured by plumes of thick, black smoke.“All of this is while peaceful Odesa was preparing for Easter Sunday,” the mayor of Odesa, Gennady Trukhanov, said in a statement posted to the city’s Telegram channel. Orthodox Christians, who make up the majority in Ukraine, celebrate Easter this Sunday, and some in the Ukrainian military had expected, or hoped, that there might be some letup in the shelling.At least 18 were wounded in the strike, according to Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential administration. He said a three-month-old baby was among the dead.The missile attack on Odesa comes a day after a Russian general outlined what appeared to be a broad new set of military objectives, including the seizure of all Ukrainian lands along the Black Sea, including Odesa.While taking Odesa had appeared to be a major goal of the Russian military at the outset of the war, efforts by Russian forces to march westward along the coastline have been hindered by fierce Ukrainian resistance and logistical issues. The sinking this month of the Moskva, a warship in Russia’s Black Sea fleet, seemed to put an end to speculation that Moscow could mount an amphibious assault on the city.In the past, Russian forces have launched rocket attacks against Odesa and the surrounding region by both air and sea, but those strikes have largely been aimed at military targets and strategic infrastructure. Until Saturday, Odesa had been largely spared the high-casualty attacks on civilians suffered by other Ukrainian cities.Saturday’s attack was carried out by a Russian Tu-95 strategic bomber flying over the Caspian Sea, according to a statement by Ukraine’s southern air defense forces. It said the bomber fired six cruise missiles, two of which were taken out by Ukraine’s missile defense system.“Unfortunately two missiles hit military targets and two hit residential homes,” the statement said, adding that Ukrainian forces also destroyed two Russian drones that were being used to help target the missiles.Russia’s Defense Ministry later said that it had fired “high-precision long-range” missiles at a logistics terminal at a military airfield near Odesa, which it said was storing weapons provided by the United States and European countries. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described the missile strikes as a terrorist attack.“The only aim of Russian missile strikes on Odesa is terror,” Mr. Kuleba wrote on Twitter. “We need a wall between civilization and barbarians striking peaceful cities with missiles.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/missile-strikes-odesa-ukraine.html
278,"Investigators from almost a dozen countries combed bombed-out towns and freshly dug graves in Ukraine on Wednesday for evidence of war crimes, and a wide-ranging investigation by an international security organization detailed what it said were “clear patterns” of human rights violations by Russian forces.Some of the atrocities may constitute war crimes, said investigators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who examined myriad reports of rapes, abductions and attacks on civilian targets, as well as the use of banned munitions.On Wednesday, civilians were still bearing much of the brunt of the seven-week-old invasion as Russian forces, massing for an assault in the east, bombarded Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, striking an apartment building.In an hourlong phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s leader, President Biden said the United States, already a major provider of defensive armaments to Ukraine, would send an additional $800 million in military and other security aid. The package will include “new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.American officials said Wednesday that the United States, in helping Ukraine prepare for such an assault, had increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine’s government about Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago. The administration also is considering whether to send a high-level official to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, in the days ahead as a sign of support for the country, according to a person familiar with the internal discussions.War crimes claims are famously difficult to investigate, and still harder to prosecute. It’s rare for national leaders to be charged, and even rarer for them to end up in the defendant’s chair.But the war in Ukraine may prove different, some experts say, and momentum has been building to hold the Kremlin leadership responsible.An International Criminal Court investigation into possible war crimes has been underway since last month, and a number of countries have been looking at ways for the United Nations to help create a special court that could prosecute Russia for what is known as the crime of aggression. Other possibilities include trying Russians in the courts of other nations under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the legal concept that some crimes are so egregious they can be prosecuted anywhere.ImageVolunteer cemetery workers in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, loading a truck on Tuesday with 65 bodies being taken for forensic investigation.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York TimesPart of the motivation for accountability is the revulsion in Europe and much of the world over the behavior of President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces, including reported executions of bound civilians and other atrocities.War crimes experts also point to technological advances in forensic tools like facial identification software not available to those looking into earlier conflicts, and the sheer number of investigators on the ground in Ukraine — crucially, with the government’s blessing. A dozen French investigators joined the inquiries this week.“There will be prosecutions, and probably all over the world,” said Leila Sadat, an international law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, and a longtime adviser to the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on crimes against humanity. “Ukraine is actually crawling with war crimes investigators right now.”Still, experts warned that the process would be slow, and that any early indictments would most likely be against lower-ranking Russian officials and armed-service members. Russia, which has described the accusations as fictional or unfounded, is not expected to cooperate in any prosecution.The report released Wednesday by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 57-member organization based in Vienna that includes Russia, Ukraine and the United States, is one of the first in-depth studies of human rights abuses during Russia’s offensive against Ukraine.Investigators looked at some of the most notorious attacks and other violent acts of the war, including Russia’s bombings of a theater and a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol, both depicted in the report as apparent war crimes.They also pored through accounts of other horrific, if less visible, acts of violence. “There are allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine,” they wrote.But often, they were stymied.Russia declined to cooperate with the three-person team of investigators, making it “impossible for the mission to take account of the Russian position on all pertinent incidents,” the report said.ImageFirefighters trying to extinguish a fire after a missile hit a warehouse on the outskirts of Kharkiv on Wednesday.Credit...Sergey Bobok/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesInvestigators found that Ukrainian forces, too, had been guilty of some abuses, particularly in the treatment of prisoners of war. “The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in nature and scale,” their report said.Michael Carpenter, the American ambassador to the O.S.C.E., said the report “documents the catalog of inhumanity perpetrated by Russia’s forces in Ukraine.” The European Union issued a similarly positive appraisal.“This war is not only fought on the ground,” the bloc said in a statement. “It is clear that the Kremlin is also waging a shameful disinformation campaign in order to hide the facts of Russia’s brutal attacks on civilians in Ukraine. Reliable information and collection of facts have therefore never been as important as today.”The Kremlin’s own mission to the O.S.C.E. dismissed the findings as “unfounded propaganda.”On Tuesday, even as the Ukrainian authorities were unearthing bodies in full view of international journalists and other observers, Mr. Putin called the atrocities a “fake” that had been elaborately staged by the West.On Wednesday, standing near the site of two mass graves, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there was an obligation both to uncover the facts and to do so in a transparent way to combat Russian disinformation.“When you see dead bodies here, from the other side, from the Russian Federation, they say it is all fake, all this is our theater,” Ms. Venediktova said.Ukrainian prosecutors and the newly arrived team of French experts exhumed bodies this week from mass graves in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, where hundreds of civilians were killed during the brief Russian occupation of the area. The French government said that its team included ballistics and explosives experts and that it had the ability to do rapid DNA tests.ImageThe Drama Theater in Mariupol after it was bombed, in a picture taken during a visit set up by the Russian military.

Although Ukraine is not part of the agreement that created the court two decades ago, it has granted the court authority to investigate and prosecute in this conflict.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Investigators say they are intent on showing the world the reality of the war.“They can see everything. They can see the situation here: real graves, real dead bodies, real bomb attacks,” Ms. Venediktova said. “That’s why for us this moment is very important.”The O.S.C.E. report described a range of subterfuge by Russian forces, including the use of Red Cross emblems, white flags, Ukrainian flags and civilian clothes. And the organization’s investigators expressed concern that both sides might be holding more prisoners than disclosed.On Wednesday, President Zelensky spoke directly about one of them: Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian politician and ally of Mr. Putin’s who was detained this week. Mr. Zelensky proposed exchanging him for Ukrainians held captive by Russian forces.Even as agreement grew among many world leaders that war crimes charges were warranted, there was some disagreement over how to characterize Russia’s actions. Some leaders, among them Mr. Biden, have begun to use the term “genocide” — an escalation of his rhetoric. On Wednesday, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, dissented.“What is happening is madness, it’s a brutality that’s unheard-of,” Mr. Macron said. But, he said, “Genocide has a meaning. The Ukrainian people and the Russian people are brethren people.”“I’m not sure that an escalation of words serves the cause,” he said.The war crimes report came amid signs that Russia’s invasion may have backfired in at least one respect. Mr. Putin has long objected to NATO’s expansion eastward into the onetime domains of the Soviet Union, describing it as a fundamental threat to Russia. But on Wednesday, two militarily nonaligned nations, Finland and Sweden, said they were seriously considering joining the alliance.Legal experts did not rule out the possibility, some day, of an indictment of Mr. Putin, who has already been castigated as a war criminal by some Western leaders. And were Mr. Putin to be criminally charged by a court outside Russia, it would likely mean he would have to restrict his international travel in order to minimize the risk of possible arrest were he to venture beyond Russia’s borders.ImageAn entrance to a bunker in Sievierodonetsk, in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, on Wednesday.Credit...Ronaldo Schemidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDavid Crane, a legal scholar at Syracuse University who was the chief prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone, an international war crimes tribunal that convicted the former president of Liberia, Charles G. Taylor, said he was confident that the International Criminal Court or some other judicial body would find legal grounds to charge the Russian president.And even if Mr. Putin is never arrested and remains the leader of Russia, he said, the legal and diplomatic consequences of a war crimes indictment would severely undermine his credibility.It would be as if “there’s like an ash mark on his forehead,” Mr. Crane said. “There’s no good options for him.”Marc Santora reported from Warsaw, Erika Solomon from Berlin and Carlotta Gall from Bucha, Ukraine.

279,"WASHINGTON — Andriy Taranov, a board member at the Ukrainian public broadcasting company Suspilne, was sitting in his office last month when he noticed a strange message running across the bottom of the television screen. It said Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, had announced a surrender.Mr. Taranov was stunned because there had been no chatter about a surrender among reporters covering Russia’s invasion of the country. “There’s nothing like that in any journalist circle,” he remembered thinking. “It looks absolutely contradictory.”The message was fake, he quickly realized. It had been planted on the chyron of Media Group Ukraine’s live broadcast by hackers.Since Russia’s invasion began in late February, hackers have repeatedly broken into the social media accounts and broadcasting systems of trusted information sources in Ukraine, like government officials and prominent media outlets. They used their access to spread false messages that Ukraine was surrendering, sometimes using fake videos to bolster their claims.And while there is no evidence that the misinformation campaign has had any discernible effect on the conflict, experts say the hackers’ intentions might not be to actually trick anyone. Instead, the hackers are most likely trying to erode confidence in Ukrainian institutions and show that the government and news media cannot be relied upon for information or to keep hackers out of their systems. The tactics mirror those used in other Russian disinformation campaigns, which have focused on fomenting divisions and cultural conflict.“You can build uncertainty, confusion and distrust,” said Ben Read, a director at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant. “It doesn’t need to stand up to a close reading to have some effect on the population; it erodes trust in all messages.”Facebook traced one hacking campaign, which targeted military officials, to state-sponsored hackers in Belarus. Other cyberattacks, including those against media outlets and telecommunications networks, have not yet been attributed to specific state actors.But Ukrainian officials suspect that Russia is behind the hacking and disinformation.“Of course they are behind these attacks,” said Victor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection.“This is the first time in history we deal with a conventional war and a cyberwar at the same time,” Mr. Zhora said. “It completely changes our landscape for what is happening around Ukraine.”The attempts to spread disinformation about a Ukrainian surrender started days after Russia’s invasion began. Hackers broke into the Facebook accounts of high-profile Ukrainian military leaders and politicians, then used their access to post false messages announcing a surrender. They accompanied some of the posts with videos of soldiers waving a white flag, falsely claiming that the footage depicted Ukrainian soldiers.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, said it quickly detected the attack and in some cases was able to prevent the hackers from posting fake messages from the compromised accounts. The hackers were affiliated with a group that security researchers call Ghostwriter, Meta said, which has been linked to Belarus.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:06 p.m. ETBehind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.At a military hospital in Ukraine, wounded soldiers pour in from the front lines in the east.Ghostwriter frequently targets public figures in Europe, security researchers said, often using compromised social media and email accounts to push messages intended to chip away at support for NATO. Since the war in Ukraine began, the group has focused its efforts there, according to researchers.“They’re aligned with Russian goals,” Mr. Read said of Ghostwriter.In mid-March, Ukrainian officials detected another hacking campaign that tried to spread false information about a surrender. According to the Security Service of Ukraine, the country’s law enforcement and intelligence agency, a hacker set up a relay system to help route calls for the Russian military. The system was also used to send text messages to Ukrainian security forces and civil servants, urging them to surrender and to support Russia, the law enforcement agency said.The Security Service of Ukraine said it had arrested the person responsible for the messages, who it said had placed thousands of calls each day on behalf of the Russian military.Another, more visible attempt to spread disinformation about a surrender soon followed. On March 16, a “deepfake” video of Mr. Zelensky asking Ukrainians to lay down their weapons and surrender to Russia emerged on social media.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, center, in Bucha on Monday. A “deepfake” video of Mr. Zelensky asking Ukrainians to surrender emerged on social media in March.Credit...Ronaldo Schemidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesHackers targeted television stations and news outlets in Ukraine to spread the digitally manipulated video, broadcasting it on Ukraine 24, a television station operated by Media Group Ukraine, and posting it to the outlet’s YouTube channel.Media Group Ukraine said it believed Russian hackers were responsible. “Our systems have been under constant attack for over two weeks, before being hacked,” said Olha Nosyk, a spokeswoman for the company. “We have strengthened the protection and applied the necessary technical means to prevent such incidents from recurring.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Deepfakes like the one of Mr. Zelensky use artificial intelligence to create seemingly realistic footage of people doing and saying things that they did not actually say or do. Researchers have warned that the technology could be exploited during elections and other high-profile political moments to spread lies about prominent politicians.Oleksiy Makukhin, an expert who has worked on combating misinformation in Ukraine, said he first saw the digitally manipulated video of Mr. Zelensky circulating on the messaging app Telegram. But many of the messages about the video highlighted the fact that it was a fake and poked fun at it for being poorly made, Mr. Makukhin said.“I hardly can think of any person in Ukraine who believed in it,” he said. “People in Ukraine are already rather educated about disinformation, which Russia is distributing all the time.”Still, Mr. Zelensky took to his official channel on Telegram to deny the video’s claims. “We are defending our land, our children, our families,” he said. “So we don’t plan to lay down any arms until our victory.”On Friday, the Security Service of Ukraine said it had discovered another text message campaign that had pushed over 5,000 messages about surrendering using a bot farm linked to Russia. “The outcome of events is predetermined!” the text messages said, according to the agency. “Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and leaders of the country who discredited themselves and already fled the capital!!!”Mr. Makukhin said he believed the disinformation was an effort to frighten civilians, comparing it to the shelling of neighborhoods.“I think the only reason for it is to terrorize the population, to make pressure and eventually try with this pressure to make our government surrender,” he said. “There is still general consensus in society that we cannot surrender. Otherwise all this pain and death were for nothing.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-hackers.html
280,"Large fires tore through oil depots on Monday in Bryansk, a Russian city less than 100 miles from the Ukrainian border that is a key logistical hub in Russia’s war effort.Russian officials said they were investigating the cause. The fires took place on the same day that Russian forces targeted critical infrastructure across Ukraine.Russian state television reported two separate explosions. One was at a civilian oil storage facility — part of a pipeline that links Russian oil fields with Europe — and the other was at a military oil depot. One blaze engulfed an oil tank that held 10,000 tons of diesel fuel, state television reported; the other contained 5,000 tons of diesel.Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting several attacks on border crossing points and other facilities inside the country.Videos from the scene in Bryansk, corroborated by the news agency Storyful, showed giant plumes of smoke billowing from two separate fires, about a mile away from each other.Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk region, confirmed only the fire at the civilian oil depot. The military facility with oil tanks next door was described by a local state-run job search website as a warehouse for missile and other fuel.No injuries were reported, according to the Russian emergency situations ministry, which dispatched firefighters and rescue services to the scene, the Russian news agency Tass reported. Russian investigators launched an inquiry into the incident.The fires in Bryansk followed a string of similar incidents in Russian regions bordering Ukraine.In early April two Ukrainian helicopters struck an oil depot in Belgorod, less than 20 miles from the Ukrainian border, the first such strike in Russian territory to be made public since the start of the war more than two months ago. Russian officials also accused Ukraine of an attack that hit residential buildings in Bryansk two weeks ago. Ukraine’s defense ministry, which has generally declined to discuss reports of attacks on Russian soil, had no immediate comment on Monday.The fires on Monday occurred hours after two senior American officials, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv, the capital, in the highest-level visit by American officials to Ukraine since the start of the war.Russian forces continued to attack critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Monday, including missile strikes that hit at least five railway stations, according to the Ukrainian authorities.In addition to the blazes that tore through the Russian oil depots near the Ukrainian border, several fires have been reported further inside Russia. Seventeen people died after a fire on Thursday at a key aerospace defense research institute in the town of Tver, north of Moscow, local authorities said.

283,"Hackers claim to have broken into dozens of Russian institutions over the past two months, including the Kremlin’s internet censor and one of its primary intelligence services, leaking emails and internal documents to the public in an apparent hack-and-leak campaign that is remarkable in its scope.The hacking operation comes as the Ukrainian government appears to have begun a parallel effort to punish Russia by publishing the names of supposed Russian soldiers who operated in Bucha, the site of a massacre of civilians, and agents of the F.S.B., a major Russian intelligence agency, along with identifying information like dates of birth and passport numbers. It is unclear how the Ukrainian government obtained those names or whether they were part of the hacks.Much of the data released by the hackers and the Ukrainian government is by its nature impossible to verify. As an intelligence agency, the F.S.B. would never confirm a list of its officers. Even the groups distributing the data have warned that the files swiped from Russian institutions could contain malware, manipulated or faked information, and other tripwires.Some of the data may also be recycled from previous leaks and presented as new, researchers have said, in an attempt to artificially increase the hackers’ credibility. Or some of it could be manufactured — something that has happened before in the ongoing cyberconflict between Russia and Ukraine, which dates back more than a decade.But the hacking effort appears to be part of a campaign by those opposing the Kremlin to help in the war effort by making it extremely difficult for Russian spies to operate abroad and by planting a seed of fear in the minds of soldiers that they could be held to account for human rights abuses.Dmitri Alperovitch, a founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington think tank, and the former chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said there was reason to maintain a healthy skepticism about the reliability of some of the leaks.But he added that the hacking campaign “once again may prove that in the age of pervasive cyberintrusions and the generation of vast amounts of digital exhaust by nearly every person in a connected society, no one is able to hide and avoid identification for egregious war crimes for long.”The leaks also demonstrate Ukraine’s willingness to join forces with amateur hackers in its cyberwar against Russia. In early March, Ukrainian officials rallied volunteers for hacking projects, and the Ukrainian government has been publishing information about its opponents on official websites. A channel on the messaging platform Telegram that lists targets for the volunteers to hack has grown to more than 288,000 members.American intelligence officials say they believe that hackers operating in Russia and Eastern Europe have now been split into at least two camps. Some, like Conti, a major ransomware group that was itself hacked in late February, have pledged fealty to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Others, mostly from Eastern Europe, have been offended by the Russian invasion, and particularly the killings of civilians, and have sided with the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.Some of the online combatants have shifted away from tactics used earlier in the conflict. In the first phase of the war, Ukrainian hackers focused on attacks intended to knock Russian websites offline. Russian hackers targeted Ukrainian government websites in January, ahead of the invasion, installing “wiper” malware that permanently clears data from computer networks. More recently, Russian hackers appear to have mounted attacks that could have turned off electricity or shut down military communications. (Several of those efforts were foiled, American officials say.)But the disclosure of personal data is more akin to information warfare than cyberwarfare. It has echoes of Russia’s tactics in 2016, when hackers backed by a Russian intelligence agency stole and leaked data from the Democratic National Committee and from individuals working on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Such hacks are intended to embarrass and to influence political outcomes, rather than to destroy equipment or infrastructure.Experts have warned that the involvement of amateur hackers in the conflict in Ukraine could lead to confusion and incite more state-backed hacking, as governments seek to defend themselves and strike back against their attackers.“Some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government,” the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned in an advisory on Wednesday. “These Russian-aligned cybercrime groups have threatened to conduct cyberoperations in retaliation for perceived cyberoffensives against the Russian government or the Russian people.”Distributed Denial of Secrets, or DDoSecrets, the nonprofit organization publishing many of the leaked materials, was founded in 2018 and has published material from U.S. law enforcement agencies, shell companies and right-wing groups. But since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the group has been flooded with data from Russian government agencies and companies. It currently hosts more than 40 data sets related to Russian entities.“There has been a lot more activity on that front since the start of the war,” said Lorax B. Horne, a member of DDoSecrets. “Since the end of February, it hasn’t been all Russian data sets, but it has been an overwhelming amount of data that we’ve been receiving.”DDoSecrets operates as a clearinghouse, publishing data it receives from sources through an open submission process. The organization says that its mission is transparency with the public and that it avoids political affiliations. It is often described as a successor to WikiLeaks, another nonprofit group that has published leaked data it received from anonymous sources.On March 1, the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda published names and personal information that it said belonged to 120,000 Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. The information came from the Center for Defense Strategies, a Ukrainian security think tank, the news outlet reported. In late March, Ukraine’s military intelligence service leaked the names and personal data of 620 people it said were officers with Russia’s F.S.B.And in early April, the military intelligence service published the personal information of Russian soldiers it claimed were responsible for war crimes in Bucha, a suburb where investigators say Russian troops waged a campaign of terror against civilians.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine,” the military intelligence service said in a statement on its website that accompanied the Bucha data dump. (Russia has denied responsibility for the Bucha killings.)Russian state-backed hackers have also carried out a number of cyberattacks in Ukraine since the war began, targeting government agencies, communications infrastructure and utility companies. They have largely relied on destructive malware to erase data and disrupt the operations of critical infrastructure companies, but they have occasionally used hack-and-leak tactics.In late February, a group calling itself Free Civilian began to leak personal information that supposedly belonged to millions of Ukrainian civilians. Although the group posed as a collective of “hacktivists,” or people using their cyberskills to further their political ends, it actually operated as a front for Russian state-backed hackers, according to researchers at CrowdStrike. The hack-and-leak operation was intended to sow distrust in Ukraine’s government and its ability to secure citizens’ data, the researchers said.Hackers affiliated with Russia and Belarus have also targeted news media companies and Ukrainian military officials in an effort to spread disinformation about a surrender by Ukraine’s military.But much of Russia’s hacking efforts have focused on damaging critical infrastructure. Last week, Ukrainian officials said they had interrupted a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine’s power grid that could have knocked out power to two million people. The G.R.U., Russia’s military intelligence unit, was responsible for the attack, Ukraine’s security and intelligence service said.U.S. officials have repeatedly warned American companies that Russia could carry out similar attacks against them and have urged them to harden their cyberdefenses. The governments of Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand have issued similar warnings.In early April, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. announced that they had acted in secret to pre-empt a Russian cyberattack by removing malware from computer networks around the world. The move was part of an effort by the Biden administration to put pressure on Russia and discourage it from launching cyberattacks in the United States. Last month, the Justice Department charged four Russian officials with carrying out a series of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in the United States.But so far, the Russian activity directed at the West has been relatively modest, as Chris Inglis, the national cyber director for the Biden administration, acknowledged on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.“It’s the question of the moment — why, given that we had expectations that the Russian playbook, having relied so heavily on disinformation, cyber, married with all other instruments of power, why haven’t we seen a very significant play of cyber, at least against NATO and the United States, in this instance?” he asked.He speculated that the Russians thought they were headed to quick victory in February, and when the war effort ran into obstacles, “they were distracted,” he said. “They were busy.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/us/politics/hackers-russia-cyberattacks.html
284,"BARENTSBURG, Norway — At first glance, Sergey Gushchin, 50, is perhaps not a man one would assume to be the Russian consul general at the world’s northernmost diplomatic mission: ponytail, bluejeans, bass player in a punk band.Yet on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago located between mainland Norway and the North Pole, it has long been a point of pride to distinguish people from governments. Russians, Ukrainians and Norwegians have lived side by side for decades in this isolated and extreme wilderness known mostly for polar bears and a rapidly warming climate, not for divisive politics.There is a saying in the high Arctic that if your snowmobile breaks down, no one asks for your nationality before helping to repair it. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has echoed at the top of the world, threatening longstanding personal and professional relationships, cultural interactions and even friendly sports rivalries.The Svalbard tourist board has called for a boycott of Russian state-owned businesses in the coal mining settlement of Barentsburg. Mr. Gushchin, until now considered an inclusive, moderating figure, has surprised and angered many with comments concerning the Russian invasion and an accusation that Norwegian news media provide mostly “fake news.”ImageA sign marks the entrance to the town of Barentsburg.ImageA worker prepares meals in the state-owned hotel kitchen in Barentsburg.Timofey Rogozhin, the former top Russian tourist official in Barentsburg, who left his job last year, now spends considerable time on Telegram, countering Russian propaganda about the invasion. Calling himself a dissident, he describes atrocities committed in Ukrainian towns as “not mistakes but crimes.”“Svalbard is a place where people from all different countries have managed to get along peacefully,” said Elizabeth Bourne, an American who is director of the Spitsbergen Artists Center in Longyearbyen, the primarily Norwegian transportation, commerce, research and university hub of Svalbard. “This situation is in danger of putting an end to that. I think that would be a tragedy.”Longyearbyen is about 30 miles northeast of Barentsburg and is inhabited by roughly 2,500 residents from 50 nations. Cultural exchanges involving singing and dancing, and sports exchanges involving games like chess and basketball have been ongoing between Barentsburg and Longyearbyen since the Soviet era.Their longevity is made more remarkable by the lack of a road between the towns. Travel must be done by snowmobile, boat or helicopter.“Maybe people of Longyearbyen wouldn’t like to see me, but they still like to see people of Barentsburg,” Mr. Gushchin said.A 1920 treaty gave Norway sovereignty over Svalbard. But other nations that signed the treaty, including the Soviet Union/Russia, have been granted equal rights to conduct such commercial activities as mining, scientific research and tourism.The Russian consulate in Barentsburg overlooks the Green Fjord and a kind of outdoor museum of the Soviet past: a bust of Lenin, a Cyrillic sign proclaiming “Communism is our goal,” refurbished Stalinist apartment blocks and smokestacks that belch sulfurous coal at the local power plant.ImageTimofey Rogozhin, formerly Russia’s top tourism official in Barentsburg, at the Spitzbergen Artists Center in Longyearbyen.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesOnce, more than 1,000 people lived here. Now there are only about 370, two-thirds of them Ukrainian, Mr. Gushchin said. Most miners are from the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which has close ties to Russia. It is the area where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists began in 2014. Others from the region work in tourism and other service jobs.A number of Russians and Ukrainians approached by a New York Times reporter on Wednesday refused to discuss politics. But Natalia Maksimishina, a Russian tour guide, criticized Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, referring to possible war crimes committed by Russian forces and saying, “I hope to see him next in The Hague.”Barentsburg is essentially operated by Trust Arktikugol, a Russian state-run mining enterprise. The boycott called for by the Svalbard tourist board recommends that money not be spent in the town’s hotel, Red Bear pub and brewery, restaurants or souvenir shop.Barentsburg seemed mostly empty on Wednesday, except for clots of tourists arriving on a small ship. Before the pandemic, tourism brought in more money than coal, Mr. Gushchin said. Now, he added, Trust Arktikugol loses “big money” weekly. Many tourists who do visit bring their own food and leave quickly, he said.Critics of the boycott say it hurts the Russian government less than local people in Barentsburg, most of them Ukrainian. Credit cards issued by Russian banks don’t work in the Norwegian financial system amid international sanctions. Flights are difficult to schedule.In a light moment during an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Gushchin lamented that his band’s solo guitarist had moved away. “When you have only a bass player and a drummer, it resembles more like punk, not rock,” he said.In a more serious moment, Mr. Gushchin put logs on a fire in the consulate’s reception area, but did not attempt to thaw the sudden chill between him and many on Svalbard.ImageVisitors read a sign written in Cyrillic script that says “Communism is our goal”.ImageA taxidermied polar bear at the Russian Consulate. Gushchin declined to be photographed standing beside the polar bear, saying it would convey a misleading symbol of Russian aggression.He stood by debunked remarks he made in English in early April to Nettavisen, a Norwegian online newspaper. He told the outlet that buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol had been destroyed not by Russian projectiles but by a Ukrainian battalion with Nazi sympathies. And that a pregnant woman photographed outside of a besieged hospital was not a patient.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Asked by Nettavisen whether he felt obliged to make such remarks in his official capacity, Mr. Gushchin said they also reflected his opinion. Otherwise, he said, he would have to resign his post immediately. On Wednesday, Mr. Gushchin said, “I saw that it really touched feelings of many Norwegians, but I told them what I think.”His remarks to Nettavisen were jarring to many, who found them sharply contrasting with Mr. Gushchin’s position as a subdeacon in the Russian Orthodox Church. Last August, he helped perform the liturgy at Svalbard Church in Longyearbyen, a parish of the Church of Norway. Siv Limstrand, the Lutheran pastor at Svalbard Church, said she had previously considered Mr. Gushchin to be “very friendly, easygoing, nonformal, extending communication and cooperation.”“People get disappointed, but he is a state official,” Ms. Limstrand said. “We can’t really expect something different from him. But a little more diplomacy, I think, could have been within reach.”ImageNatalia Maksimishina, a Russian tour guide, said she hoped to see Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, prosecuted at The Hague.Having arrived in Barentsburg in November 2018, Mr. Gushchin awaits his successor, saying he and his wife are eager to return to Moscow to see their 22-year-old daughter and his 82-year-old mother. Perhaps, many who know him on Svalbard say privately, that is why he dares not contradict Mr. Putin.Clearly, Mr. Gushchin is sensitive to optics. On Wednesday, he declined to be photographed standing beside a taxidermied polar bear in the consulate, saying it would convey a misleading symbol of Russian aggression.He also said he would not attend a planned cultural exchange in Longyearbyen on May 21 so as “not to provoke anybody.”“There are a lot of Russian and Ukrainian compatriots and also Norwegians who won’t be very happy if I take part,” Mr. Gushchin said.When he took the posting on Svalbard, Mr. Gushchin said, he considered it a “dream” job, one that has been “a big adventure.” But he also said he is ready to return to Russia.With a sigh, then a laugh, he said he hoped the invasion of Ukraine did not become “something more ugly and global.” If World War III breaks out “and we’re stuck here,” he said with gallows humor, “it will be difficult to go home.”ImagePeople snowmobiling toward Barentsburg.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/barentsburg-norway-ukraine-war-russia.html
285,"The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don’t already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here.ImageInternational sanctions imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia froze his personal assets. Or, at least, the assets he appears to own.More effective, perhaps, are the sanctions against the Russian oligarchs in Mr. Putin’s orbit. That’s not necessarily because these well-connected, globe-trotting billionaires could put pressure on the president to change course on the war in Ukraine. According to William F. Browder, it’s because much of their extensive wealth is held on behalf of Mr. Putin.Mr. Browder, once a major investor in Russia, has become one of the Kremlin’s biggest enemies. Russia has tried several times to get Interpol to issue arrest orders against him. And he is such a thorn in Mr. Putin’s side that the Russian president singled him out by name during his first official summit with President Donald J. Trump.What did he do to attract such ire? Mr. Browder ran one of the largest hedge funds in Russia in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But his public battles against corporate corruption eventually prompted his expulsion from Russia in 2005 as a “threat to national security.”In 2009, his tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who was investigating government money laundering, was arrested and later died in a Moscow prison nearly a year later, at age 37. In 2012, Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which punished Russians involved in the lawyer’s death with sanctions. At Mr. Browder’s urging, similar laws have been passed around the world.That makes Mr. Browder highly knowledgeable about the effects that sanctions have on Russia’s political and business elite, not least Mr. Putin. Now that world leaders are imposing round after round of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, he brings a unique perspective on how these actions may influence Mr. Putin’s calculations.Ahead of the release of his new book, “Freezing Order,” DealBook spoke with Mr. Browder about how to end the war in Ukraine, the influence that oligarchs wield and what really motivates Mr. Putin. The conversation has been edited and condensed.What do you think Mr. Putin’s endgame is at this point?Putin is a dictator. One of the great benefits of dictatorship is that he can steal as much money as he chooses. And he chooses to steal a lot.After a while, in a country where people sort of think they’re in a democracy, they start to see that they’re hungry and not being cared for in hospitals and their children aren’t being educated. They start getting angry, and they get angry at the guy in charge. And so every once in a while, the guy in charge has to do something to make people less angry at him.The purpose of these wars is that he was afraid of being overthrown. And so the best way to do that is to get everyone to rally around the leader. And so when you’re talking about an endgame, there is no endgame. This is just him staying in power.As a longtime target of Mr. Putin’s — and someone who I imagine has tried to better understand what motivates him — what do you think he is thinking?The problem is that there’s some psychological features that feed into this whole thing, which make it a particularly toxic brew. The world that he lives in is like a prison yard. This is a world where everybody is sort of eyeing each other up aggressively, and everybody has to show strength to each other. You know, the most powerful person in a yard has to be the most vicious person in order to keep their power.And so his idea was to just destroy Ukraine and then thump his chest and show everybody how powerful he is. But his misjudgment in how effectively the Ukrainians are fighting back has made him look stupid. And for a prison yard type of person, that’s the worst thing that could ever happen.Do you think he understands that?Of course.Do you think everyone around him is a yes man?It’s not just the people around him. It’s also the people in the West. The Ukrainians have shown him huge disrespect by successfully fighting back. And so, for example, the war crimes that have been committed are not by accident. This is part of his thing.He’s got to show that he and his people and everybody around him are so vicious. They’ll just keep on escalating and upping the ante, and they don’t care what people think about them. In fact, they want people to think this bad stuff about them because that makes them look more brutal.Given what you’re saying, what is a reasonable way to think about the endgame?There is no reasonable way for this thing to end. There’s only an unreasonable way.It’s either he ends up taking over Ukraine and then moving his way toward the Baltic countries to challenge us at NATO — or for him to be defeated by Ukraine and then having the Russian people overthrow him because he was the weak guy who couldn’t beat Ukraine.How do you handicap those two options?I think each of those options has a 15 percent probability.What’s the remaining 70 percent probability?That he and the Ukrainians and all of us are stuck in this low simmer. It’s not going to be at the same level of awfulness that it is right now, but at this low simmering conflict that just goes on and on and on for years.Do you think oligarchs really have influence over him? Do you think sanctioning them has been effective?The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.It’s like a medicine for a certain type of disease. The medicine can have more effect depending on when you administer the medicine. So if we had sanctioned the oligarchs preinvasion and we had done so with our arms locked with our allies, it would have had a much greater effect on his actions than doing it now.It doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be doing it now, but he was betting that there would be no serious sanctions because he’s done a lot of terrible things over the last 20 years and there haven’t been serious sanctions before.But does Mr. Putin care about what the oligarchs think?Of him? No.But it’s extremely important that we do sanction all the oligarchs for a different reason than hoping that the oligarchs are going to overthrow him. The oligarchs are holding his money. So when you see an oligarch worth $20 billion, $10 billion of that is Putin’s. He can’t hold any money in his own name.So, he’s got to give it to somebody who actually has the financial wherewithal to act — to be a holder of these funds. When we say we want to sanction Putin, the only effective way of doing that is sanctioning the oligarchs. And the reason is neither to get him to change his mind or to get the oligarchs to overthrow him — it is basically to prevent him from using this money to execute this war in the future.So it’s not that these oligarchs call him and say, “You have to cut this out”?The oligarchs couldn’t do that. Any oligarch who did that would be immediately arrested, impoverished and killed.What do you think American companies should be doing? What do you think of those that worry that if they leave they will never be able to come back?First of all, continuing to do business in Russia after this invasion is the equivalent of continuing to do business in Nazi Germany when Hitler started persecuting the Jews. It’s the same thing.Every business has a moral obligation to get out of Russia, no matter what the cost is. I don’t think anyone should even be concerned about returning because everyone will be welcomed back in a post-Putin regime. And in a Putin regime, I don’t think anyone should even want to go back.What about China? What influence does it have at this point?The one loophole in this whole thing is China, right? China has been very clear that it’s not going to join the rest of the world in challenging or punishing Putin for what he’s doing. I think that China has to be careful.Why? Doesn’t China still have leverage over the West?Well, the answer is that the U.S. is probably going to be less likely to sanction China before consumers themselves sanction China.So, you think consumers will step in to punish China for supporting Russia?I could easily imagine a movement where every American consumer looks at the label. At the end of the day, consumers, whether organized by the government or not, have as much power as governments do — or more.Do you think Mr. Putin still has people who are following you?The way Russia works is that I don’t think he’s spending a lot of time on me, but he gave an order 10 years ago to his government to go after Bill Browder in every way possible. Until the order is rescinded, there are people whose job it is to go after me, no matter what’s going on in the world. And they continue to go after me.ImageWhat do you think? Will sanctions against oligarchs pressure Putin to end the war? Let us know: dealbook@nytimes.com.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/business/dealbook/09db-browder-russia-santions.html
286,"While Russian troops have battered Ukraine, officials in China have been meeting behind closed doors to study a Communist Party-produced documentary that extols President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a hero.The humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union, the video says, was the result of efforts by the United States to destroy its legitimacy. With swelling music and sunny scenes of present-day Moscow, the documentary praises Mr. Putin for restoring Stalin’s standing as a great wartime leader and for renewing patriotic pride in Russia’s past.To the world, China casts itself as a principled onlooker of the war in Ukraine, not picking sides, simply seeking peace. At home, though, the Chinese Communist Party is pushing a campaign that paints Russia as a long-suffering victim rather than an aggressor and defends China’s strong ties with Moscow as vital.Chinese universities have organized classes to give students a “correct understanding” of the war, often highlighting Russia’s grievances with the West. Party newspapers have run series of commentaries blaming the United States for the conflict.Around the country, the Communist Party has organized sessions for officials to watch and discuss the history documentary. The 101 minute-long video, which was completed last year, does not mention the war in Ukraine but argues that Russia is right to worry about neighbors that broke away from the Soviet Union. It describes Mr. Putin as cleansing Russia of the political toxins that killed the Soviet Union.“The most powerful weapon possessed by the West is, aside from nuclear weapons, the methods they use in ideological struggle,” says the documentary’s stern-voiced narrator, citing a Russian scholar. The documentary was marked for internal viewing — that is, for audiences chosen by party officials and not for general public release — but the video and script have recently surfaced online in China.Since the demise of the Soviet Union, it says, “some countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia have become forward positions for the West to contain and meddle in Russia.”ImageA new documentary being shown to officials in China says that the country must never follow the course taken by the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, above, who had started glasnost.Credit...Georges DeKeerle/Sygma via Getty ImagesChina’s leaders have long used the Soviet collapse as a cautionary tale, but Mr. Xi has given that tale a more urgent, ominous spin. In doing so, he has embraced Mr. Putin as a fellow authoritarian lined up against Western dominance, demonstrating to the Chinese people that Mr. Xi has a partner in his cause.It’s unclear whether allegations of atrocities by Russia soldiers, with civilians found shot in the head or with their hands tied behind their back before being killed, will affect China’s support of the Russian invasion.But China has so far refused to condemn Mr. Putin for the war, which has killed thousands of civilians. Despite pressure from other world leaders to use its influence over Moscow to help end the crisis, Beijing has done little besides call for peace. And on Thursday Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, expressed his country’s commitment to strong ties with Moscow during talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in China. The Biden administration has cast the war as a contest between democracy and authoritarianism. Chinese officials are mounting a counternarrative that American-led domineering is the source of conflict in Ukraine and elsewhere. They regard China and Russia as both menaced by “color revolution,” the party’s phrase for insurrections backed by Western governments. President Biden’s recent comments calling for Mr. Putin’s ousting are likely to reinforce Beijing’s view.“They actually believe their own narrative about color revolutions and tend to see this whole situation as a U.S.-led color revolution to overthrow Putin,” said Christopher K. Johnson, the president of the China Strategies Group and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst of Chinese politics.“Both domestically and internationally, Xi has been peddling this dark narrative since he took power,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview. “It allows him to justify his accumulation of power and the changes he’s made by creating this sense of struggle and danger.”The documentary depicts the collapse of the Soviet Union as a lesson to Chinese officials not to be seduced by Western liberalism. China, the documentary says, must never follow the course taken by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last leader who had started glasnost, or openness, and engagement with the West.In 2013, propaganda officials under Mr. Xi put out a documentary on the lessons of the collapse of the Soviet Union. This latest take offers an even more conspiratorial interpretation.Image Stalin lying in state in 1953. Stalin, the new Chinese documentary argues, was a modernizing leader whose purges went too far but initially “were something of a necessity” given the threats to Soviet rule. Credit...Serge Plantureux/Corbis, via Getty ImagesThe documentary attributes the decline of the Soviet Union to political liberalization, especially what Beijing calls “historical nihilism,” or emphasizing the Communist Party’s mistakes and misdeeds. It accuses historians critical of the Soviet revolution of fabricating estimated death tolls by many millions for Stalin’s purges.Stalin, it argues, was a modernizing leader whose purges went too far but initially “were something of a necessity” given the threats to Soviet rule. It suggests that rock music and modern fashion were symptoms of the moral rot that later set in.“They’ve taken only one lesson from all of this, and that is you do not allow any freedom of expression,” said Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who studies Chinese and Soviet history, “because this kind of freedom inevitably leads to loss of political control and that creates chaos.”The documentary credits Mr. Putin with restoring Russia’s spirit. It shows Mr. Putin marching in a parade marking Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany, and young Russians kissing a banner featuring his portrait. Previous leaders in Moscow — above all Mr. Gorbachev and Nikita S. Khrushchev — are portrayed as dupes, bewitched by the siren song of liberal reform and Western superiority.ImageMr. Putin in 2015 with a photograph of his father.

Officials overseeing the screenings are often described in official notices as calling for cadres to maintain firm loyalty to Mr. Xi.“Loving a party and its leader is not a cult of personality,” Zheng Keyang, a former deputy director of the party’s Central Policy Research Office and a consultant on the documentary, said in a discussion about the documentary published by a pro-party website this month.Chinese leaders have been debating why the Soviet Union fell apart ever since it dissolved in 1991. More than his predecessors, Mr. Xi has blamed the Soviet Union’s breakup on lack of ideological spine and Western political subversion.The Latest on China: Key Things to KnowCard 1 of 4A strict Covid policy. As China grapples with its worst Covid outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic, the government is following a “zero Covid” strategy. The approach could have far-reaching effects and has revived concerns that the country is going back to a planned economy.The war in Ukraine. China’s officials and its media are increasingly repeating the Kremlin’s narrative about the conflict. This joint propaganda has undercut Western efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and has found a receptive audience in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.A new security deal. The Solomon Islands signed a sweeping security agreement with China that could threaten the stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region. The deal gives Beijing a foothold in an island chain that played a decisive role in World War II and could be used to block vital shipping lanes.A pause on wealth redistribution. For much of last year, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, waged a fierce campaign to narrow social inequalities and usher in a new era of “common prosperity.” Now, as the economic outlook is increasingly clouded, the Communist Party is putting its campaign on the back burner.“If you have the worldview that you see in this documentary, you could tell yourself the story that the Russians are facing a real threat from the West,” Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University in Washington who studies elite politics in China and Russia, said in an interview.ImageA statue of Lenin in Moscow. Mr. Xi has blamed the Soviet Union’s breakup on lack of ideological spine and Western political subversion.Credit...Yuri Kochetkov/EPA, via ShutterstockThe study drive is aimed at instilling loyalty among cadres before a Chinese Communist Party congress late this year where Mr. Xi appears set to claim a third term.Political loyalty has become more crucial to Mr. Xi as Beijing tries to contain Covid outbreaks with stringent lockdowns, and manage a slowing economy. China’s foreign policy is under scrutiny, after some Chinese scholars posted essays criticizing Beijing’s refusal to condemn Mr. Putin.Many of the critical essays have been deleted and the party has pushed harder to defend its stance in recent weeks. Editorials in Communist Party newspapers have amplified the Chinese leadership’s argument that the real culprit in Ukraine is the United States and NATO, for undermining Russian security.“It was the United States that personally lit the fuse of the present conflagration between Russia and Ukraine,” stated one of a series of editorials in the Liberation Army Daily, the military’s main newspaper.Universities and colleges have organized indoctrination lectures for students, suggesting that officials are worried that young, educated Chinese may be receptive to the criticisms that Beijing has been too indulgent of Mr. Putin.ImageCommunist Party supporters carrying posters of Stalin and Lenin during a ceremony last year in Moscow’s Red Square.Credit...Dimitar Dilkoff/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesLiu Zuokui, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told an audience of college students in eastern China that the war arose from “NATO’s eastward expansion that squeezed Russia’s space for survival,” an online summary of the lecture said.China, another speaker told physicists in Beijing, had to protect its strategic partnership with Russia from “intense shocks and impacts.”The party’s demands for conformity over the crisis will make it harder for any dissent to coalesce into a pushback against Mr. Xi. “There’s an ‘either we hang together or we hang separately’ attitude that comes into play,” Mr. Johnson, the former C.I.A. analyst, said of Chinese leaders. “If it’s a strong nationalist approach, then who in the party doesn’t want to be a good nationalist?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/asia/china-russia-ukraine.html
287,"DOBRA, Slovakia — Driving back to his village near the Ukrainian border last Thursday, the mayor had to stop to let a train pass, and assumed he wouldn’t have to wait long. But the flatbed wagons, stacked high with military equipment, just kept coming. He waited for nearly half an hour.“It was a very long train, much longer than usual,” recalled Mikulas Csoma, the mayor of Dobra, a previously sleepy village in eastern Slovakia that, over the past month, has become a key artery funneling weapons and ammunition into Ukraine by rail from the West.The train that delayed Mr. Csoma’s drive home was not only unusually long but also signaled a singular escalation in Western efforts to help Ukraine defend itself. It carried an air defense system made up of 48 surface-to-air missiles, four launchers and radars to guide the rockets to their targets, which in Ukraine means Russian warplanes and missiles.As President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia vows to fight the war to its “full completion” and his forces regroup for an expected push in Ukraine’s east, NATO countries, including the United States, are scrambling to keep the weapons flowing and bulk up the country’s defenses.Bolstering Ukraine’s long-range air defense capabilities is seen as especially critical. Ukraine already had its own S-300 and other air defense systems, but some of these have been destroyed, leaving Russia with a large degree of freedom to hit Ukrainian targets from the air with warplanes and cruise missiles.Increasingly desperate to reverse this imbalance, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has repeatedly pleaded with NATO to “close the sky over Ukraine” by imposing a no-fly zone. But NATO has been unwilling to send its own warplanes into Ukraine.Instead, the United States offered Slovakia, a fellow NATO member, a substitute battery of American-made Patriot missiles if it would “donate” its aging S-300 system to Ukraine.ImageAn S-300 antiaircraft missile launching during a military exercise in Greece in 2013.Credit...Costas Metaxakis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJaroslav Nad, Slovakia’s defense minister and a gung-ho supporter of Ukraine, said it would have been unthinkable before Russia’s invasion for his country to send large quantities of even basic weapons across its eastern border free of charge, never mind an old but still powerful Soviet-made antiaircraft system.“But this is the world’s new reality,” he said in an interview in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. “We are a frontline state. We have war on our border and more than 330,000 Ukrainians coming to our country. The paradigm is completely different now.”Mr. Putin, he said, “is equal to Hitler” and must be stopped in Ukraine before he can move further West. “Ukraine is literally fighting for our future,” he said.Like Slovakia, other countries are also steadily expanding the scope of their military aid. The No. 2 Pentagon official met in Washington on Wednesday with America’s largest military contractors to discuss how ready they are to restock supplies and what new capabilities to send to Ukraine.The meeting and a new package of weapons, including artillery and ammunition, is intended in part by the Biden administration to blunt criticism that it is not doing enough for Ukraine and is too hesitant to send long-range weapon systems.Other NATO members are already sending Ukraine bigger and better weaponry than before, including T-72 tanks and short-range air defense systems from the Czech Republic.ImageMikulas Csoma, the mayor of Dobra, Slovakia, at home on Sunday. “They should at least let me know about this kind of thing,” he said of the transport of the S-300 near his village. Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesThe S-300 system from Slovakia is the biggest item a NATO country has sent so far. It was previously deployed in Nitra, a city east of Bratislava at the other end of the country.From there, it was hauled by truck and train to Dobra, where the state-controlled rail yard has Soviet gauge tracks, wider than the standard in Europe, which means it can run trains to and from Ukraine, which also has Soviet tracks.Other big items now under discussion for transport to Ukraine via Slovakia include aging MIG-29 warplanes and sophisticated, self-propelled Howitzers called Zuzana 2. Also under review is a plan for Ukraine to send hundreds of damaged tanks, some of them captured from Russian forces, across the border for repair in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, all of which have experience fixing Soviet-made equipment.Slovakia “is not going to send tanks because we don’t have any spare tanks,” Mr. Nad said, underscoring an issue confronting even Ukraine’s most eager backers. “We have to keep enough capabilities for our own armed forces.”But Slovakia is transporting not only weapons from its own stocks into Ukraine. It is also sending military aid from many other countries, including the Czech Republic, Australia and what Mr. Nad described as “countries that claim that they are not sending military material to Ukraine.”Hungary, Slovakia’s southern neighbor, for example, has declared itself neutral in the conflict and barred weapons from passing through its own territory to Ukraine — largely to avoid upsetting deliveries of cheap Russian gas — but it is believed to have quietly provided weapons through other countries.ImageMIG-29 fighter aircraft near a military air base in Vasylkiv, Ukraine, in 2016.Credit...Gleb Garanich/ReutersAsked about this, a Hungarian government spokesman in Budapest declined to confirm or deny that his country is providing military material, saying only that “Hungary’s standpoint is well known, and it has remained unchanged.”Alarmed by the flood of weapons flowing across the borders of Slovakia, Poland and Romania, Russia has sought to stop or at least slow it by declaring all foreign arms destined for Ukraine a “legitimate target.” Russia’s foreign minister vowed last month that Moscow “will not allow” the transfer of Slovakia’s S-300 air defense system.It is too late for that now, and after failing to thwart the delivery, the defense ministry in Moscow claimed on Sunday that Russia had already destroyed the Slovak missile system when sea-launched cruise missiles hit a hangar near the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Mr. Nad, the Slovak defense minister, dismissed this as a “fake news,” apparently aimed at saving Russia’s face and calming the nerves of Russian pilots sent on missions to bomb Ukraine. Mr. Nad said he had spoken with Ukraine’s defense minister on Monday and been assured that “this system is working and is working well” and was not in Dnipro.Previous military cargo sent into Ukraine by rail through Dobra and the nearby town of Cierna nad Tisou contained mostly ammunition and basic military hardware.A separate weapons conduit through Poland, the main route for American arms, has involved weapons like Javelin, NLAW and Stinger missiles, which are light, portable, high-tech and relatively easy to hide in trucks passing through Polish border crossings into western Ukraine.An air-defense battery, however, is too big to hide, particularly when it travels on trains with more than 120 wagons in full view of drivers blocked by their passage. The cargo was so bulky it took two days to deliver it just a few miles from Dobra into Ukraine in two separate trains.ImageSmoke rising from the airport of Dnipro, Ukraine, on Sunday.Credit...Ronaldo Schemidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“Everyone knows what is going on,” said Jakub Zsolt, a steel factory maintenance worker who lives across the road from the rail yard. He said his grandchildren were scared by all the commotion, but added that he had himself grown accustomed to the clatter of military helicopters and the rumble of trucks carrying weapons to the loading yard.All the same, he said, he worries that Slovakia, a small country of just 5.4 million people, is now wading too deeply into Ukraine’s war with Russia.“The Russians might attack us,” he said, adding that he did not understand why Ukrainians needed so much help when “they come here driving much nicer cars — Porsches and Mercedes — than we drive in Slovakia.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.Most refugees fleeing the war, nearly all women and children, don’t drive anything, but cross on foot carrying just a change of clothes.Mr. Zsolt’s jaundiced view of Ukraine highlights the success of opponents of the pro-Western Slovak prime minister, Eduard Heger, who in an interview last week said, “We need to help Ukraine in every possible way to win this war.” His foes, playing to a substantial segment of the population traditionally favorable to Moscow, have sought to turn public opinion against support for Ukraine and seized on the war as a political opportunity.Robert Fico, a scandal-tainted former Slovak prime minister, upended the government’s efforts to keep the delivery of the S-300 battery secret until it had safely arrived in Ukraine when he posted a video on his Facebook page last Thursday that showed a train carrying the disassembled air-defense system on its way to Ukraine.He denounced Mr. Heger as “a freak in American hands who will do whatever the Americans tell him to do” and demanded that the public immediately be told where the S-300 system was going.ImagePrime Minister Eduard Heger of Slovakia at the Government Office in Bratislava last week.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesMr. Nad, the defense minister, said the delivery had been kept secret for security reasons. The opposition, he added, is playing “political games” against the interests of their own country and also Ukraine.“Russia is killing thousands of people in Ukraine and I am not going to count the votes that I would lose — or gain — based on the decisions of the government to help. The only thing that I am counting is the lives we can save in Ukraine,” he said.Pavel Macko, a retired Slovak general who served with NATO in Afghanistan and Germany, said the S-300 system delivered to Ukraine dated from the 1980s, when Slovakia was a member of the Warsaw Pact as part of Czechoslovakia, and was inferior to American-made Patriot missiles. But, he added, Ukrainians know how to use it and will be able to reduce Russia’s mastery of the skies.“This is not just symbolic but an important addition that could help make Russia change their plans,” he said.The mayor in Dobra, Mr. Csoma, said he supported helping Ukraine, but was noncommittal when asked about the wisdom of sending a powerful weapon system like the S-300.Miffed not to be informed in advance about the disruption to traffic caused by the S-300 trains, he said: “They don’t tell me anything. They should at least let me know about this kind of thing.”Nobody really worried much about the war spreading into Slovakia, he said, but the authorities have nonetheless dusted off old civil defense plans, with police taking an inventory of potential bomb shelters. In the event of conflict, the mayor said, he had been assured that district authorities would send buses to evacuate his village’s 520 people.“If something bad happens, we will all leave,” he said. “So there is no panic yet.”Reporting was contributed by Julian Barnes in Washington and Benjamin Novak in Budapest.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/14/world/europe/ukraine-russia-nato-s300.html

289,"Japan is stepping up its rhetoric and economic measures against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, furthering Moscow’s economic isolation and joining the United States and European nations in calling for investigations into accusations of war crimes.The country said on Friday that it would expel eight Russian diplomats, and announced a ban on Russian coal and restrictions on imports including timber, vodka and machinery.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida lambasted what he said were “brutal and inhumane acts” carried out by Russian forces in cities across Ukraine, including in the suburban town of Bucha near the capital, Kyiv. He accused them of having repeatedly violated international humanitarian law by attacking civilians and nuclear power plants, a sore point for Japan given its 2011 experience with nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.“We must hold Russia strictly accountable for these atrocities,” he said, calling actions by Russian troops “unforgivable war crimes.” Japan supports an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court into accusations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, he added, and would support an independent inquiry by the United Nations.Japan’s Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador on Friday and cited the killings of civilians in large numbers, calling them war crimes, the ministry said in a statement.In a significant shift from past instances of Russian aggression on its neighbors, Japan acted swiftly after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February to send aid to Ukraine and impose economic penalties and sanctions on Russian individuals and entities.Japan this week added hundreds of people and organizations to its Russia sanctions and said that it would freeze the assets of two of Russia’s largest banks, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, which are also subject to U.S. sanctions. Mr. Kishida said the country would also prohibit new investment in Russia.Moves to curb energy imports from Russia could be costly for Japan, which is resource poor and heavily dependent on overseas fossil fuels for its power generation. Mr. Kishida said the country would wean itself off dependence on Russia by turning to renewable energy and nuclear power, steps that are likely to take time and could be politically contentious. Japan took most of its nuclear plants offline after a tsunami in 2011 set off the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster, one of the worst in history.Japanese officials did not specify a time frame for the coal ban, saying only that Russian energy imports would be reduced “in stages.”In addition to coal, Japan imports significant amounts of liquefied natural gas from Russia. Mr. Kishida said last week that the country would not pull out of joint ventures with Russian state-owned companies for oil and gas projects near northern Japan. He said they were “extremely important” to Japan’s energy security.An editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun, one of Japan’s major daily newspapers, said on Friday that the country should play a role in making President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia realize that his invasion of Ukraine was wrong.“The United States, Europe and Japan must unite and increase pressure on Russia so that its invasion ends in failure,” the newspaper said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/09/world/asia/japan-russia-ukraine.html
290,"The conventional wisdom is that Americans, scarred by the country’s involvement in wars for the last two decades, are by and large done with all that. When Russia invaded Ukraine, there was never a question of whether President Biden would send in U.S. troops to assist the Ukrainians. This wasn’t just because of a war-weary public: Pitting two nuclear powers against each other was incomprehensible.But in our latest Times Opinion focus group, 10 Americans — representing a range of political parties, ideologies and backgrounds — were clearly struggling with what the United States could or should do about the war and the daily evidence of brutality that increasingly alarms them. They had thought a lot about leadership, grit and hard decisions, especially as shown by Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and about how much they are willing to sacrifice, financially and otherwise, as the fallout from the war and Western sanctions continue.None of the participants brought up Ukraine when we asked our first question, about their main concerns regarding America today. But when asked how much they cared about the war, on a scale of one to 10, eight participants gave scores of five or greater. There was an overwhelming sense that “America must do something” but not to the point of direct military involvement — at least unless Vladimir Putin resorted to a nuclear weapon. It reflected the unease and murkiness of what Americans think the country’s role in the world today should be. As for President Biden, several participants praised his handling of the conflict, but overall, their views of him were tepid.This is the eighth focus group in our series America in Focus, which seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism. We conducted the discussion with Kristen Soltis Anderson, our focus group leader, who does similar work for political candidates, parties and special interest groups.

When I think about the war in Ukraine, I feel blank?Dale (55, Asian, works in education, from California): Anger.Katherine (31, Hispanic, assistant service manager from Texas): Fearful.Aleeta: Disbelief, truly.Karina (55, Hispanic, self-described homemaker from Arizona): Afraid.Jamie: Terrified.James: Concerning.Nick: Uneasy.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Aleeta, why disbelief?Aleeta: It’s disbelief that there really is a war, an active war, where innocent civilians and persons are dying.Kieran (22, Asian, operations associate from Texas): It’s disbelief in human nature. It makes me sad to see that people are capable of this time and time again in history.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Jamie, you said terrified. Why?Jamie: First of all, Putin’s crazy. I don’t think it’s going to stop in Ukraine. And if we don’t step in and do something and stop it before it gets out of control, we could be looking at another Hitler. We’re just sitting here, living our lives. And everybody else is over there dying and begging for help.Charles (67, white, technical staffer from Maryland): I was going to use the word helpless. You kind of feel like you want to take some action. But most any action you take has the potential of just making things worse.Kristen Soltis Anderson: This is on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means I really don’t care that much about this at all, and 10 means I care about this an enormous amount. What number would you assign to how much you care about what’s happening in Ukraine right now?Nick: Four.Aleeta: A six or a seven.Katherine: Eight.Kieran: Seven.Dale: Nine.Karina: Seven.James: Eight.Jamie: EightCharles: Seven.Taylor (25, white, works in data entry, from Florida): I would say five.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Tell me about your five.Taylor: I’m more worried about our borders and inflation and gas and the fact that Biden closed down the Keystone pipeline. There’s so many other things that we should be worried about at home.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Nick, why a four?Nick: I know that at any moment, we could get involved a bit more, but at least right now, we haven’t been affected a ton.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Dale, you were a nine, my highest number.Dale: I have a background in the military. People don’t realize that this happens all the time, with Syria and other parts of the world. Things have been allowed to happen with us not looking as carefully as we could. So I’m just irritated to see that this is happening again, We could have done a better job in terms of the appropriate deterrence that needed to be done. That’s why there’s a sense of anger on my part here.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Jamie, tell me why you put yourself at an eight.Jamie: The stock market’s been really bad. It fluctuates because nobody knows what’s going on. Pretty soon, people aren’t going to be able to afford to even go to the grocery store. Everything is expensive. The gas, everything, traveling. We basically don’t travel.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Is there anything in particular that you have seen, read, or heard about the war that has stayed with you and stuck in your memory? James?James: With Putin being the bully that he is, I think it was kind of allowed. I don’t see the United Nations carrying their weight in this issue. I’m ex-military as well. And I don’t see them stepping to the plate. The players that are supposed to play with this guy, Putin, they’re standing down, for some reason.Aleeta: I listen to N.P.R. And they mentioned that so far it’s been 183 children who have been killed and that they are attacking orphanages and maternity wards. I think that kind of just completely obliterated my faith in humanity.Yara Bayoumy: Based on what you’ve seen, read, or heard, why do you think this war is happening?Nick: Putin saw Ukraine as some sort of threat in their border relations. And that’s why they decided to get involved, because they didn’t want to kind of stand back any longer. Something that I read or heard, I just saw a video clip of a missile strike and, yeah, just the damage that it caused. And I play video games occasionally with my friends. And we have these war games that a lot of the youth are a part of. And they don’t really take it very seriously. But that just really opened my eyes to, wow, these are really big problems in the world. People are dying. Destruction’s happening. And we’re just kind of sitting back, so.Karina: Honestly, I think a lot of it has to do with just Putin and his ego. I think he wants to conquer another country. And I think he surrounds himself with people that let him keep thinking that about himself. He’s a madman.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Kieran?Kieran: From what I understand, it’s basically about control and power and how Putin wants to regain Ukraine once again as part of Russian territory, so he can do whatever he wants to keep the borders safe, keep them away from NATO, the U.N.Charles: Putin feels that one of the worst things that’s happened in the last 30 years was the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And he’s trying to regather all of those satellite nations back into the fold of Russia again. How could we allow this to happen? Well, you turn it around and say, well, what could we have done to stop it? And there’s not a lot of answers that I can see that wouldn’t be just as destructive. This is a problem you have any place where you have one person get too much power and influence.Yara Bayoumy: Dale?Dale: I think one needs to take a look at what’s happening in the Russian media and what’s been happening over the years. They’re living in an echo chamber there. And I think his people below him are very scared to tell him what’s going on here. It’s history repeating itself. We’ve got to be very careful about that. We have to understand that we can’t stand back and allow this to happen.Kristen Soltis Anderson: What comes to mind when I say Vladimir Putin?Taylor: I first think of Communism, like a dictator. Somewhere I wouldn’t want to live.Jamie: I just think he’s crazy. And I do think this is repeating history. My dad was in the military. My husband was in the military. They all fought. My brother, he’s fought. Everybody I know has fought for this country. So I don’t want a war. But I don’t want to sit here, either, and watch all these people die and see people’s heads cut off and their arms and legs cut off. I don’t want to see that. And that’s what I remember. When I see stuff, that stays with me.VideoKristen Soltis Anderson: What comes to mind when you think of Volodymyr Zelensky?Kieran: He looks like a badass. I think he’s doing a very good job of showing leadership right now in terms of taking an active voice and using that in the U.N. and NATO. Second, he’s doing a good job of actually being there with his soldiers on the dirt, putting his life with theirs. He’s not acting like he’s better than anyone else, which I think is a very rare quality in a leader.Katherine: I just think that he’s a really strong leader. The fact that he’s still there — he didn’t leave or go into hiding. He’s actually involved.Karina: Right there in the trenches with his troops and putting out great messages to the world.Dale: I think he embodies the four key characteristics of good leadership: being first, leading from the front, being fair, firm — he’s establishing that — also being able to go with the punches and all. He’s an actor too — and acting is not — there might be a negative connotation of being an actor, but in reality, being a great actor is being able to communicate very well. And I think he’s shining right now.Kristen Soltis Anderson Are there any things that you’ve seen Zelensky do and think, gosh, I wish other leaders did more of this?Aleeta: Just like Dale mentioned, the leading from the front, joining the front lines, just being on hand and on call when necessary, not having so many middlemen. It’s him that’s producing this information. It’s him asking for help for his people. Our country would benefit from a more hands-on leader versus just the politics alone.Yara Bayoumy: When you think about America’s allies in Europe, do you think that they have been doing the right thing when it comes to the war in Ukraine?Kieran: One country that sticks out the most to me is Poland, accepting huge amounts of refugees, getting them there. I have been seeing a couple of videos of Ukrainian children go into their first day at school in Poland, which I think is really awesomeJames: I don’t think everybody’s on board with all of the sanctions. I think that if the sanctions are supposed to do what they’re supposed to do, then we need 100 percent participation. Dale: Germany and other countries are dependent on the energy that comes from Russia. I could understand it from the perspective of the leaders of those countries — you talk about inflation that we’re having in the United States, I mean, that would go through the roof. And there would be a lot of challenges for those people as well.VideoKristen Soltis Anderson: How would you rate President Biden’s handling of the war in Ukraine?Karina: He spoke harshly in public arenas to Putin. I think his predecessor wasn’t willing to do that. So I feel better about the administration than I did before.Dale: I’ll raise my hand to support as well. They bungled what happened with Afghanistan, the pullout. He and his administration, with Congress, were able to coalesce NATO and parts of the E.U. to get together. When I think back, I would not think that they would be able to get NATO to actually come together and get a stronger response that Putin would not have expected. I think Putin expected that we would not be able to stand up that quickly to him.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Is there anybody who would say your opinion of President Biden is basically the same? Your opinion hasn’t really changed one way or the other. Show of hands.[Six people raise their hands.]Is there anybody whose opinion of President Biden has gotten worse as a result of what you’ve seen since this invasion?[James raises his hand.]James: I think it’s been political. I think he’s taken a safe position. He’s been in politics so long that he understands, where it’s almost like chess. So I’m going to move my rook over just so I don’t get my queen taken. Or I’m going to move those pieces just enough on the board where it doesn’t make me look bad.Kristen Soltis Anderson: What is the word or phrase, filling in the blank, that comes to mind: When I think about how the United States is approaching the war in Ukraine, Russia, Putin, I feel blank.Taylor: I feel confused. I know we’re doing sanctions. But are we still buying gas from Russia? That might be a stupid question, but I feel like we’re still supporting them in a way.Nick: I feel like the U.S. is reserved.Katherine: Worried.Dale: Two words, calculated patience.Aleeta: Indifferent.Charles: Frustrated.Jamie: I’m confused.Karina: Cautious.James: I like the word calculated. But I’m going to change that to not patience, but calculated politics.Kieran: Unsurprised. Like James and Dale have said, it is calculated. It’s very political. I think the U.S. is very isolationist. In matters like this, they take a very long time before they physically get involved.Kristen Soltis Anderson: OK. Karina, tell me why you gave the answer that you gave.Karina: The president can give strong speeches. And we can stand with our allies. But at the same time, we’re not putting boots on the ground, which I think is a good thing. Everything has to be thought out.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Dale, you wanted to jump in here.Dale: I used the word patience because I would view what’s happening in Ukraine right now as the equivalent of Russia’s Afghanistan revisited, as well as Vietnam. If we want to avoid having to send boots on the ground and have any of our young volunteer people, sailors, soldiers, Marines, and airmen lose their lives over there;we’re being very patient about it. The Ukrainians are doing the fighting for us. We’re giving them the equipment. And if Russia gets into a situation where they’re having enough damage there, it’s going to affect the regime. So we have to be very patient in what we’re doing. There’s a calculated game that’s going on right now.Kristen Soltis Anderson: What should we be doing to support Ukraine, if anything?Jamie: I do think we should help in any way, whether it’s medical, food, weapons. But I don’t want to have to put our people over there.Nick: I think we should give humanitarian, medical, food relief just to help out those that are suffering. But I guess direct military involvement, I don’t think we should.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Is there anybody who thinks that we should be doing more direct military involvement?Kieran: I don’t want to say I’m comfortable taking actual military action. But there is a large part of my brain that thinks that might be the only way to actually stop this at this point because unfortunately the U.S. is — a lot of other countries are sending humanitarian aid. We’ve given them Wi-Fi. We’ve given the Ukrainians food, weapons, everything. But one day, all the people are going to die. And there aren’t going to be the people to use the weapons.Charles: I think that we do have to do a much better job of building a coalition to isolate Russia. On the news here in the U.S., you kind of get a sense that we are having the world come together to isolate Russia. But that’s not true with China and India and Pakistan and most of Africa. It’s almost like the world’s dividing into two major camps. Some are kind of willing to go along with Russia because they see some advantages in that to themselves in the long run. And then you have the West.Yara Bayoumy: A lot of you mentioned the sanctions that the U.S. and other countries have imposed on Russia and Putin. Those sanctions, including the ones that the U.S. has imposed, have caused the price of gas to go up for Americans. Do you think that’s worth it? And how far higher, if at all, would you be willing to pay for a gallon of gas if it means that Putin is being further squeezed?Charles: Well, compared to some of my European colleagues, we have cheap gas. So even before all this started, I could see people spending what would be the equivalent of $9 a gallon for diesel fuel in Germany.Taylor: I don’t think it’s worth it. And I’m not willing to pay that much. I think we should be continuing work on the Keystone Pipeline, instead of depending on other countries for our gas. And that would solve our problem. And then we wouldn’t have to support Russia.James: I think that if we’re going to be a superpower, if we’re going to be part of the United Nations, and we’re going to look at humanity, then we’re going to have to maybe eat that cost. And we can see a lot of things play out, even in Covid, how things changed and people start doing things in other ways.Yara Bayoumy: What obligation do you think the United States has toward Ukrainian refugees?Katherine: I think that the U.S. should open its borders to refugees from Ukraine and provide whatever assistance they need. That’s something that we can do to help. It’s not stepping on anyone’s toes, and not going to put us in the middle of a war.Jamie: I think we should let them in. We can help them. We might not be able to help everybody. But we can definitely help some people. I see thousands of people coming through the border that we’re helping. And they’re all getting shipped into everybody’s state. A lot of the people that I know, my family, they’re all getting tons and tons of people in their states — Arizona, Florida, Virginia. So I think we can help them.Dale: For years and years, we’ve been, I think, allowed to reap the benefits of having such a connected economy and depending on other countries. And that allowed us to not have any core capabilities with regards to energy. I have relatives down in Louisiana, where they lost a lot with the changes in oil and everything in the Gulf. It killed the economy down there. But now it’s starting to come back because of these gas prices. So I think we could do a lot. We should be able to bring more people in. We haven’t done a great job of bringing people in. But maybe that’s something we could actually invest in more, to show that we are the guardians of the free world.VideoKristen Soltis Anderson: Do you think the current situation actually threatens the United States’ security? Do you personally feel like your security is threatened at all?Karina: It has the potential to. I read that they’re searching to find out if it’s true or not that Russia used chemical weapons in an attack in Ukraine. And if they’re going to go there, what’s going to stop them from nuclear? It’s just a tense, scary thing.Taylor: I’m more worried on a financial side. We’re so dependent on other countries for other things. And all the prices of everything going up had me really worried. I’m glad gas has kind of stopped for now. But when it was climbing, that was really scary for me just because it’s just a lot of money for me in my situation where I’m at right now in life.Kieran: I think that as long as nuclear weapons exist in the hands of anyone, everyone’s threatened. And just the fact that that threat hangs above the countries’ heads is a terrifying concept. Because it’s like, if you help these people any more than you already are, a lot of people will die.Kristen Soltis Anderson: How many of you, show of hands, think that it is at least somewhat likely that Putin will use nuclear weapons?[Eight people raise their hands.]Nick and Dale, you’re my only two without hands. Dale, what do you think? Why do you think that that’s not likely?Dale: Hopefully there’s enough people in there that if they were actually going to launch one of those, like a tactical nuclear device, that someone would have enough wherewithal to figure, you’re not supposed to do that. So I’m just hoping in faith that there’s enough humanity out there to really think about it.The people who can control the keys to that, hopefully they know that.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Many of you earlier on said you did not think that the United States should be intervening militarily. If Putin uses a nuclear weapon, would that change your view?Jamie: My worst fear is that’s going to happen to us. It really is. It was when Kim Jong-un was doing all those little mind games back then. It was a concern then. And now it’s a concern again.Taylor: Well, I think if he used nuclear weapons, that would just — I don’t know — be the last straw.Nick: I don’t think he will. As it is, I don’t think he has very much, if any, support from any other countries. The second that he does anything that affects anyone outside of Ukraine, I think everybody’s just going to stomp on him. So it’s — I think he’s smarter than that, to resort to that. So that’s why I don’t think that he’s going to use it.Kristen Soltis Anderson: How is this likely to end, in your view?Katherine: I hate to say this, but I really feel like Ukraine is going to have to, maybe not fully surrender, but surrender in some ways to make it stop. If that doesn’t happen, then I feel like there’s a possibility of a world war.Charles: Well, I think it’s going to end up with another long-term standoff in the world. And I think Ukraine’s going to lose a lot before we get to that stage.James: I see Ukraine as a formidable opponent for Russia. I think Ukraine has proved that they’re not going to be fully integrated. I think they’re going to come through. I think they have the right president. It’s going to take a little while. But I think that they’re going to stand strong.Yara Bayoumy: Do you think the United States has a responsibility to uphold democracy around the world? And if so, how far do you think that responsibility should extend or not?Aleeta: I don’t think that it’s ultimately left to us as the free world to impose free-world living and doctrine on other countries. That’s kind of gotten us in trouble in the past. So lead by example is kind of where I’m left at when it comes to us, the United States.James: I think when we look at the characteristics of democracy, is one of them humanity? And is that what we’re fighting about? Or are they two separate issues? So if the question is whether we should fight for democracy across the world, my answer is no.Charles: I think you can fight to keep democracy where it is but not impose it.Dale: Though we’re divided — and I think a lot of it’s coming from external sources and other things that allow media to happen the way it is — I still think we need to come back to our fundamentals of why this experiment in democracy that’s only 200-plus years old —- we’re a young country here. I think we still need to lead by example.Yara Bayoumy: How the Biden administration has dealt with the war in Ukraine, is that going to factor at all in your assessment and thinking when we get to the next election?Aleeta: His decisions previously and currently are not a factor for next election in my mind for him. It’s all the things prior to, and it’s everything outside of this, in my mind, that would sway me on the upcoming elections in his regard.Taylor: Well, I would say this whole situation hasn’t changed my opinion of him too much. I still think very negatively of him from everything before this and now.Kristen Soltis Anderson: Karina, will this change whether or not you consider voting for Biden in the future?Karina: Probably not. I actually don’t think he’s going to run again.Yara Bayoumy is the world and national security editor for Opinion. Adrian J.

291,"The headlines about inflation have, once again, been awful. Consumer prices are rising more rapidly than at any time since 1981, and producer prices are soaring as well.Stocks and bonds have been shaky since the start of the year, and the tragedies of the larger world are profound and proliferating. A lingering pandemic has taken more than 3 million lives around the world; Russia’s assaults on Ukraine have killed hundreds of civilians and uprooted more than 10 million people; and geopolitical tremors have raised the risks of a nuclear conflict to Cold War levels.This is all terrible. Yet precisely because so much awful news has already been incorporated in stock, bond and commodity prices, there is reason for suspecting that market conditions may not get much worse and may even get better before long. When the consensus is this glum, it may be time for cautious optimism.Down so long“Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me”: That’s the title of a 1966 counterculture novel by Richard Fariña, a songwriter and folk singer, about his student years at Cornell. While it doesn’t discuss bonds or commodity prices, it nicely captures the current situation in financial markets.Fariña asked a question that has resonated with Cornell students for decades. How is it possible to survive spring in Ithaca, N.Y., when the cold, gray weather just keeps coming? The answer: Embrace misery. Once sleet and snow become your baseline, a hint of sunshine is cause for exhilaration. (Fariña’s personal story had a tragic ending. He died in a motorcycle crash soon after his book was published.)Consider the state of financial markets now. Misery is the baseline assumption. Further declines will surely come, but it will take new, unexpected shocks to unmoor stocks, bonds and commodities in a fundamental way. Those shocks could come from Russia’s war, or from a source we can’t yet anticipate.Yet even so, better times will arrive eventually — if not this month, then soon enough, for those willing and able to hang in until the season changes. In the current environment, this modestly optimistic thought is contrarian — a sign, in itself, of how bleak things have become. Finding encouragement in the middle of misery isn’t popular. If anything, most “investors clearly shifted back to a ‘glass half empty’ mind-set” after the barrage of inflation headlines, Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, an insurance and financial services company, wrote on Thursday. He acknowledged, however, that despite the gloom, “there are hopeful signs that inflation could slow down in the coming months.”So I won’t go too far in claiming that the glass is half full. This is not a prediction of a revival of the galloping bull market of last year — or a denial of the possibility of a recession next year. I have no idea what’s coming next. Nor does anyone else.Rather than make fruitless forecasts, we can plan for a broad range of outcomes. But doing so requires dispassionate thinking — and the ability to see past the current news. Just as too much optimism can induce you to make foolish bets, excessive gloom can lead to panic — which, in this case, could mean fleeing investments in both stocks and bonds, because both major asset classes have performed poorly.Instead, at cheerless times like these, it’s worth appreciating the potential for profit embedded in dreadfully low prices. First, always make sure you have enough ready cash to meet your emergency needs. But after that, if you invest steadily in diversified, low-cost index funds that track the entire stock and bond market, those low prices can be a boon, assuming the markets eventually recover. History suggests that they will.Roaring inflationIt would be easy to give up on the markets.Bad tidings about red-hot inflation have been hard to miss. Prices of a broad range of goods and services have been rising swiftly, but lately, the situation has gotten much worse. The most recent government report on the Consumer Price Index showed that overall inflation in the United States rose at an 8.5 percent annual rate in March, the highest pace since December 1981. A variety of other inflation measures have also been troubling, in the United States and around the world.John Butters, senior research analyst for FactSet, a research company, wrote in a report on April 12 that 65 percent of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings for the first quarter of this year cited inflation as their biggest problem. He cited this comment on an earnings call from Lawrence Kurzius, the chief executive of McCormick, the global food company: “Cost inflation has remained persistent with recent escalation in some areas such as transportation costs. And as such, we have raised our cost inflation guidance. It is now a mid- to high-teen increase.”The three main causes of the current inflation burst are well-chronicled and include:A combination of stimulative fiscal and monetary policy taken to support the economy’s recovery from the coronavirus recession of 2020.Supply shortages caused by the pandemic, ranging from a scarcity of parts needed for automobiles to bottlenecks in factories in China, to an insufficient number of workers willing and able to take jobs at prevailing wages.Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Western sanctions on Russia, which, together, have increased the prices of energy, food and a range of other commodities, and contributed to supply shortages.Turning a cornerYet the problem of raging inflation is hardly a new discovery. A year ago, it was evident that prices were rising rapidly enough that they needed to be taken seriously. I pointed that out then and so did many others.Russia’s war complicates matters considerably. Nonetheless, it is at least possible that inflation is about to ebb. James Paulsen thinks so. He is chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an independent stock research firm in Minneapolis.The Russia-Ukraine War and the Global EconomyCard 1 of 6Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.“I think we may be at a turning point,” he said in an interview. “There’s a good chance that inflation has peaked or is very near its peak.”Because inflation began to surge 12 months ago, the year-over-year comparisons will be more favorable this spring. Furthermore, two of the causes of current inflation — expansive financial conditions and coronavirus-induced supply problems — are already shifting substantially and may soon bring down the rate of inflation, Mr. Paulsen said.“The biggest supply problem, by far, is labor,” Mr. Paulsen said. “A lot of people couldn’t work earlier in the pandemic, and a lot were reluctant to work at the wages then being offered. That’s all changing now.” As the labor bottleneck eases — thanks, in part, to higher wages — he said that the supply of goods and services will begin to meet the demand for them, reducing pressure on prices.Andrew Slimmon, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said in an interview that freight costs and shipping backlogs have been dropping, which may predict that the C.P.I. will be substantially lower six months from now and that, “maybe, the Fed won’t need to raise interest rates quite as much as the markets are expecting.” Corporate earnings continue to be strong despite the world’s problems. So he expects a rocky year, but one that will include stock market gains before it’s over.Pessimism as a baselineRussia’s assault on Ukraine, and the course of the pandemic in China and elsewhere, are wild cards. On Thursday, the Conference Board, a business research organization, projected an extremely wide range of possible outcomes for oil prices, inflation, economic growth and interest rates. Clarity is impossible now.The critical question for short-term traders is whether financial markets have already baked in sufficient pessimism. Energy price shocks have caused recessions in the past. That could happen this time, too, deepening the gloom around the planet.So it’s no time for casual bets. Only investors with an appetite for financial adventure will want to take on much fresh risk now. Still, the fog will lift at some point. With a little luck, those with the fortitude to have hung on when the outlook looked grim will find they have prospered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/16/business/economy-inflation-war-covid.html
292,"CHISINAU, Moldova — Before war erupted next door, Moldovans had big plans for their country.But the Russian invasion of Ukraine put Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of Europe’s poorest nations, in an extremely vulnerable situation, threatening its economic development, straining its society with waves of refugees and evoking existential fears of yet another Russian occupation.The war jitters are also adding another chapter to Moldova’s long and increasingly desperate effort to untangle itself from Moscow’s clutches. In pursuit of that, it recently applied to join the European Union, but the prospect of gaining admission anytime soon is remote. “We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” said Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, in an interview.Moldovans’ fears swelled anew on Friday, when a Russian general said his country’s military now plans to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine. That would establish a land bridge from Russia in the east to Transnistria, a heavily armed, breakaway region in Moldova’s east — bordering Ukraine — that is controlled by Russia. ImageMimi Castel, a 19th-century winery operated by Adrian Trofim, in Bulboaca, Moldova, in April. Repercussions from the war in Ukraine have taken a heavy toll on the business.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesWhether Russia has the wherewithal to swallow up such a large stretch of Ukrainian territory is debatable, especially in view of the enormous losses its military suffered in the battle for Kyiv. But whether real or just an effort to stir up trouble in the region, the Moldovans are taking the general’s threat seriously.The Moldovan government has long been nervous about Transnistria, a thin sliver of territory that is controlled by at least 12,000 separatists and Russian troops. Since the war erupted, the Moldovan and Ukrainian militaries have faced the extra concern of whether the Transnistrians were going to jump into the battle and start attacking Ukraine from the west. So far, that has not happened.Tucked between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is tiny — with less than three million people — and for centuries has been torn between greater powers: first the Ottomans and Russia, and now Europe and Russia. The theme, clearly, is Russia, and Russia does not want to let it go.ImageThe cellars at Mr. Trofim’s winery in April. He said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesMoscow exerts a stranglehold over nearly 100 percent of Moldova’s energy supply. And the Kremlin is constantly trying to stir up Moldova’s many Russian speakers who are susceptible to its propaganda, especially in Transnistria.That is what seemed to have happened on Friday, when, according to the Russian news media, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said, “Russian control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are cases of Russian-speaking people being oppressed.”The Moldovan government immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about the general’s statement, saying it was “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”For Ms. Sandu, 49, the country’s first female president, it was another hurdle along a dangerous pathway she has been trying to navigate since the crisis began.Moldova has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and barred Moldovans from sticking pro-Russia symbols on their cars. At the same time, the country did not fully join the European Union’s sanctions on Russia, for fear of being cut off from Russian gas.ImagePresident Maia Sandu of Moldova at her office in Chisinau. “We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” she said.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York Times“No one said it was going to be easy,” Ms. Sandu, 49, said from her office on Stefan cel Mare, the grand boulevard in the capital, Chisinau, that cuts past a patchwork of hulking, Soviet-style office buildings. “But no one said it was going to be this hard.”The war has been hard not only on her but on most everyone here. Before the hostilities started, Adrian Trofim, whose family owns a 19th-century countryside winery and resort, thought that he was finally catching a break after two years of struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. He was adding a wing to the hotel, setting up a spa focused on wine-based treatments and gearing up to produce a sparkling wine.But now his operations have fallen into peril. Brandy worth a quarter of a million dollars that he needs to ship to Belarus has been blocked in his warehouses. His regular Ukrainian customers have no way of paying him, costing him several more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he cannot ship his chardonnays to China, one of his new markets, because the port in Odesa, Ukraine, that he uses for exports shut down as soon as the first bombs fell in February.ImageThe Moldovan police near Palanca, along the border with Ukraine, in April. The breakaway, pro-Russian statelet of Transnistria accounts for much of that border. Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York Times“I don’t know what to do,” said Mr. Trofim, who may soon have to lay off almost half of his staff. “Everything is frozen until we understand how to live with this situation.”It could be a while. When the war began in Ukraine, residents of Chisinau said they were awakened by the sounds of not-so-far-off explosions. Then Ukrainian refugees started streaming in — more than 400,000 have arrived, Moldovan officials have said — putting a severe strain on public services in a country where the average annual income is less than $6,000.Prices for basic goods then shot up as supply chains were disrupted. And business owners had to persuade their employees, terrified that the war might cross into Moldova, not to flee the country, following the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who moved abroad in the past decade.ImageA small grocery in Roghi, Moldova, in March. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, prices for basic goods have soared in Moldova and supply chains have been disrupted.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York Times“We were already considered a high risk,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moldova. “We had just started convincing investors to take a shot on us. Now everyone has backed out.”It is not all bad news. Some Ukrainian companies are considering moving to Moldova, in search of a safer environment. And with all of the foreign dignitaries (and news crews) swooping in, its international profile has received a lift, leading the government last month to rebrand Moldova as “a small country with a big heart.”Many Russians discovered that big heart long ago. During Soviet times, retired officers flocked to Moldova, drawn by the scenery, good food and sunshine. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the country was run by pro-Russian elites, who kept strong links with Moscow, especially regarding energy.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Moldova receives all its gas from companies controlled by Russia. And even though Moldovan leaders have talked a big game about weaning the country off Russian gas and getting energy from other countries like Azerbaijan, Turkey and Romania, none of those, at the moment, could come close to what Russia provides.ImageMoldova relies on Russian companies for all of its natural gas supplies, making it vulnerable to pressure from Moscow. Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesAnd so Russia continues to use its sway over gas prices to push Moldova around. Russia has intimated, for instance, that it would lower prices if Moldova agreed to make concessions on Transnistria, which Moldova has refused.Moldova’s twin problems, of energy and Transnistria, are interconnected. In the Soviet era, Moldova’s biggest power plant, and its two biggest gas-pumping stations, were built in Transnistria.“If you look at the map, it doesn’t make sense,” said Victor Parlicov, an energy analyst and a former government official. “It was built this way in case Moldova would try to pursue its own path.”Transnistria has its own flag, complete with a Soviet-style hammer and sickle, and a separate identity from the rest of Moldova. Its roots go back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union carved out a small republic in the same area, before incorporating parts of it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during World War II. Mr. Parlicov said that this fit a pattern of the Soviet authorities reshaping the borders of republics against historical realities, which created the potential for conflict.Transnistria’s situation mirrors that of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists rebelled after the anti-Russian 2014 rebellion, setting off a chain of events that led to war. Transnistria also complicates Moldova’s aspirations to join the European Union.ImageRussian troops in March at the entrance to the village of Varnita, in Transnistria, a breakaway region in eastern Moldova.Credit...Laetitia Vancon for The New York Times“We’d be happy to be part of the E.U.,” said Serghei Diaconu, the deputy interior minister. But, he added, half-jokingly, Transnistria was “a big pain” that could discourage the E.U. from accepting Moldova.Joining NATO would be an even taller order. Neutrality is enshrined in Moldova’s constitution, a holdover from the early 1990s, when it tried to stand on its own without antagonizing Russia. Now, Moldova’s leaders are questioning the wisdom of that approach.“If you ask me whether neutrality is going to keep us safe, I don’t know,” said Ms. Sandu, the president. “It did not help over the last three decades to convince Russia to take its troops out of the country.”The geopolitical tightrope the country is forced to walk, in the eyes of many Moldovans, means its future is intertwined with Russia’s. Mr. Trofim, the winemaker, for one, said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.As he looked at the winery’s vast, neat gardens, empty but for a few visitors, he said that he was appalled by what Russia had done in Ukraine, but that he could not condemn anyone forever.“I cannot say I will never do business with Russia,” Mr. Trofim said. “It is a matter of the well-being of my company.”ImageThe grounds of the all-but-empty Mimi Castel winery in April.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/moldova-ukraine-russia.html
293,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could mark a troubling shift: the end of a relatively peaceful global era.Though it has not always felt like it, the world has since the 1990s endured less war than any other period in recorded history. Wars and resulting deaths plummeted with the conclusion of the Cold War in 1991 — and the subsequent end of direct and proxy conflicts between the world’s great powers.“The end of the Cold War was the greatest thing to happen to peace in a long time,” said Jeremy Shapiro, the research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations.But the world has since changed. After emerging from the Cold War as the lone superpower, the U.S. grew weaker, bogged down by failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Russia and China evolved into more formidable powers; they are now better positioned to challenge a world shaped by American norms and rules.Invading Ukraine is the biggest example of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to challenge a U.S.-led order. Another is Russia’s intervention in the Syrian civil war. China has its own interests — in controlling Taiwan and increasing influence in East and Southeast Asia.The strengthening alliance between Russia and China in recent years also suggests they are sketching new lines of global competition. And in response to these threats, other potential great powers, like Europe, are rebuilding their own militaries.Peace, experts said, has not looked this fragile in decades.How conflict recededFor much of human history, war was the norm. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, great powers battled each other most years. And in the 19th and 20th centuries, they fought in conflicts that culminated in two world wars that killed more than 100 million people and displaced tens of millions more.But after the Cold War, the rate of new conflicts fell more than half, according to Bear Braumoeller, an international security expert at Ohio State University.

Labeled conflicts do not account for all deaths.Source: Our World in DataBy The New York TimesThe drop was unprecedented, William Wohlforth, an international relations expert at Dartmouth College, told me. “We can’t find another period with a shift in conflict trends that compares,” he said.Several ingredients factored into this peace. There was a lack of great power competition; no country could seriously challenge the United States. Nuclear weapons also continued to deter nations from warring against each other, given the potentially apocalyptic consequences. An increasingly integrated global economy made any war a risk to everyone’s continued growth. And peacekeeping institutions, like the U.N. and the E.U., created outlets for countries to try to settle disputes and enforce antiwar rules (although not always successfully).Another element: Great power is no longer synonymous with an appetite for conquest. U.S. officials in the nation’s century as a superpower have viewed attempts to take over other countries as a direct route to sinking the world order they had built and led. America’s own acts of aggression — in Vietnam, Panama, Iraq and elsewhere — were aimed at upholding that order, however flawed the justifications.Rising challengersImageRussian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Xi Jinping, China’s leader.Credit...Pool photo by Pavel GolovkinRussia and China never liked the idea of a U.S.-led world order. For decades, both have called for a new structure in which they get a bigger, or even dominant, say over how the world works.Russia has its own imperial ambitions in Eastern Europe, and it views NATO’s expansion toward its western doorstep as an existential threat.China has benefited economically from the liberal order and globalization. But its leaders also want to oppress domestic dissidents, the democratic government in Taiwan, protesters in Hong Kong and predominantly Muslim Uighurs, among others, without outside interference.These are longstanding goals for Russia and China, but they now have a greater ability to act on their beliefs. Putin has cemented his rule after more than two decades in power, and in that time he moved to modernize Russia’s military (though the stalemate in Ukraine has exposed major weaknesses). China has grown its economy to a point that it may soon rival the United States’, and it is expanding its military power and regional influence as well.That could lead to more great power competition — potentially through a new wave of proxy wars between these countries and the West or, worse, direct conflict.But any great shift in the world order hinges largely on what China does, as the only real rival to the U.S. Given the risks of war, China could continue to pursue its interests with economic or diplomatic levers over military force, said Stacie Goddard, an international security expert at Wellesley College.China also has repeatedly called for respecting every nation’s sovereignty. There are good reasons to be skeptical of that pledge, including China’s interests in Taiwan and its continued support for Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. But if China means it, the war in Ukraine could end up looking less like a sign of what is to come and more like a deadly last gasp from the Cold War era.State of the WarPresident Biden denounced Russia’s invasion and declared that Putin “cannot remain in power.” But a White House official downplayed the possibility that Biden had called for the Russian president to step down.While Biden was traveling in Poland, two rocket strikes hit Lviv in western Ukraine, not far from the Polish border. The strikes undercut earlier signals that Russia had narrowed its ambitions.Western officials, however, have picked up chatter among senior Russian commanders about giving up on capturing Kyiv and other key areas in Ukraine, according to two people with access to intelligence.Ukrainian forces have mounted a counteroffensive in the Kyiv suburbs to block Russia’s route to the capital, destroying tanks and killing Russian troops.More on UkraineThe 22-year arc of Putin’s time in power tracks his slide from statesman to dictator.The chaos of war could undo decades of progress against infectious diseases in Ukraine, experts warn.What kind of weapons is Russia using?

294,"President Biden emphasized growing defense cooperation with India in a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday — a line U.S. officials have increasingly touted in the hopes of convincing New Delhi to come off the fence over Russia’s war on Ukraine.India has long been reliant on Russia for military hardware, an important factor in the deep historic ties between the two countries. And so despite global condemnations of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Mr. Modi’s administration has tried to remain neutral — refraining from criticizing Russia, while calling for negotiations and engaging Ukraine with humanitarian assistance.While American officials have been understanding of the complexity of India’s balancing act, seeing New Delhi as an important ally in the face of an assertive China, they have at times expressed frustration that India’s stance is offering President Putin some cover. Some U.S. officials have warned of consequences if India expands trade with Russia, especially any increase in purchasing oil, as the West tries to tighten sanctions.India imports only about one percent of its oil needs from Russia. Many Indian officials have spoken of a double standard, with Europe continuing to import oil from Russia while India’s imports come under increased scrutiny.President Biden echoed sentiments that other U.S. officials have expressed in recent weeks in attempts to reassure India that its source of military hardware would not run dry were it to take a firmer stance against Russia.“We share a strong and growing major defense partnership,” President Biden said in his opening remarks, before the defense and foreign ministers of both countries sat for extended dialogue. “The United States and India will continue our close consultations on how to manage the destabilizing effects of this Russian war.”India’s defense purchases from the United States have increased over the past decade to about $20 billion. But analysts have said expanding the ties to the point where India’s dependency on Russian military hardware would wane will be slow as it would require overcoming deeply rooted hesitancy in the relationship between the United States and India that dates back decades.In his remarks, Prime Minister Modi continued India’s delicate line on Ukraine — expressing concern about the suffering caused by the war but refraining from calling out Russia as the aggressor.“Our talks today are taking place at a time when the situation in Ukraine is very worrying,” Mr. Modi said. “During this entire process I spoke several times to the presidents of both Ukraine and Russia. I not only appealed for peace, but also suggested there be direct talks between President Putin and the president of Ukraine.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/world/europe/biden-narendra-modi-russia.html
295,"Russia pounded military targets throughout Ukraine on Saturday, in apparent retaliation for the sinking of an important naval ship and in preparation for an offensive in the Donbas region of the country’s east.Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday the strikes had destroyed workshops in a tank factory in Kyiv and a military hardware repair facility in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Also targeted was the Ukrainian military factory on the outskirts of Kyiv, called Vizar, that produced the Neptune anti-ship missile that sank the flagship vessel of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, in a major embarrassment for the Kremlin.The coming battle in the east will be fought largely on open terrain offering far fewer havens for Ukrainian fighters to hide while launching attacks on Russian armored vehicles, as they did so successfully in repelling the Russian forces from around Kyiv. The Russian missile attacks on Friday into Saturday seemed calibrated to weaken Ukraine’s ability to withstand armored assaults in that setting.ImageEmergency workers tended to the wounded after the missile strike in Kharkiv.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe strikes served as a reminder that wherever the fighting is concentrated on the ground, Russia still can and will strike anywhere in Ukraine, and they underscored the importance of Ukraine’s industrial capacity, including its ability to make and repair weapons.Why Russia waited until two months into the war to target these facilities is unclear. While the strikes could have been a response to the sinking of the Moskva, Russia’s Defense Ministry has not acknowledged that Ukrainian missiles hit the ship, which it says was mortally wounded by a fire and ammunition explosion.Some analysts have pointed to the recent appointment of a top Russian battlefield commander in Ukraine, Gen. Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, as a factor in Moscow’s strategy. He is expected to address the lack of coordination and planning that has hampered Russian forces so far, reorganizing and redirecting them for the fighting in Donbas.The rocket and missile attacks on Saturday also rained down on an airport in central Ukraine, the Black Sea port of Odesa, the northeastern city of Kharkiv and the western city of Lviv. Explosions from at least one strike shook Kyiv, the capital, and Ukraine’s air defense force said it had shot down a volley of four cruise missiles in flight elsewhere in the country.Moscow retaliated diplomatically against the West on Saturday, barring Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior British officials from entering the country over their support for Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Mr. Johnson has been a leading voice in Europe against Moscow, and even traveled to Kyiv a week ago to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Britain has supplied Ukraine with new anti-ship missile systems, armored vehicles and other military equipment. Ukrainian fighters have used lightweight anti-tank weapons supplied by Britain to devastating effect against Russia’s armored vehicles.ImageA military factory called Vizar, which produced the Neptune missiles used to attack the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, was struck by Russian missiles. Credit...Fadel Senna/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn Germany, the economy minister called on people to cut back their energy consumption, including by drawing curtains and lowering the temperature in their homes, as part of what he described as a national effort to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Germany has joined other Western nations in imposing embargoes on Russian coal and possibly oil, but it is reluctant to do the same with Russian gas, which accounts for more than half its gas imports.“We can only become more independent of Russian imports if we see it as a large joint project in which we all participate,” the minister, Robert Habeck, told the Funke media group on Friday. He added, in reference to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: “It’s easy on the wallet and annoys Putin.”In the weeks since Ukrainian forces repelled the Russian attempt to seize Kyiv, residents have been streaming back into the city. But the window-rattling blasts Saturday offered a stark reminder that the war is far from over, even far from the front.Russia’s cruise missiles, the principal weapon in Saturday’s attacks, can strike over long distances at sites throughout the country. Through the day Saturday, air raid sirens wailed in Kyiv, and overnight the distant, dull thuds of air defense missiles exploding could be heard in the sky over the city.“Our air defenses are working, our military is defending us, but all the same there were explosions,” in a southeastern district of the capital, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said in a statement on Telegram. The strike killed one person and wounded several others, he said.In the statement, Mr. Klitschko said Kyiv remains a target for Russia despite the defeat of its ground assault force, which retreated hastily, leaving in its wake burned tanks, its own war dead and hundreds of civilian bodies lying on streets. Police said Friday they have so far found 900 bodies of civilians in the Kyiv region, the administrative district surrounding the capital.ImageFreshly dug graves in Irpin, Ukraine, outside Kyiv, the site of intense fighting in the first month of the war. Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesPresident Zelensky said in a late night address on Saturday that Russian forces had been expelled from nearly 1,000 villages, towns and cities of varying sizes across Ukraine. Most of the liberated communities lie in the northern parts of the country, and had suffered extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure during the monthlong Russian occupation.Mr. Zelensky also acknowledged the Ukrainian army had lost as many as 3,000 troops in fighting to date, while insisting that Russian fatalities were far higher.Elsewhere in Ukraine, the air defense force said it had shot down four cruise missiles flying toward Lviv, and that a missile had exploded in the air near Odesa. Also near Odesa, Ukraine shot down a Russian unmanned aerial drone as it was reconnoitering military sites, the local authorities said.Later, Mr. Zelensky acknowledged that Russia seemed poised to take full control of Mariupol, a strategic southern port, with its troops controlling all but a small part of a besieged city they have reduced to ruins. In recent days, Russian forces have advanced to the city center, and the remaining Ukrainian troops, hunkered down in the sprawling Azovstal steel plant and in Mariupol’s port, are greatly outnumbered and desperately short of provisions.“Nevertheless, our guys are heroically defending,” said Mr. Zelensky, speaking to Ukrainian media outlets. “We are grateful to them for that.”Near Kirovograd in central Ukraine, Russian long-range rockets struck an airport Thursday night, according to a local mayor, who said there were dead and wounded after the attack but did not specify how many.The cruise missile strikes in Kyiv have continued nearly daily through the war but often hitting targets in outlying areas, without causing much disruption to life in the city, which has been reviving. So far, missiles have not struck key government buildings, including the presidential office and Parliament — whether they were targeted but successfully shielded by Ukraine’s air defenses is not clear.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“The war goes on in Kyiv and we cannot relax,” said Galina Ostapenko, 72, a retired postal worker, who was walking in the yard of her apartment building a block or so from the site of the strike Saturday.“What happened pains my heart,” she said of the explosion in her neighborhood. “I will teach my grandchildren to hate the Russians.”ImageFunerals in Andriivka, Ukraine on Saturday, for six people killed in the city, which was occupied by Russian forces for more than 30 days.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesAs Russia steps up its attacks on Ukrainian military targets, Washington has been speeding up efforts to supply Ukraine with advanced weapons and long-range artillery pieces in recent days. Russia warned Washington of “unpredictable consequences” if it continues to ship heavy arms to Ukraine.The attacks with precision munitions came as Russia continued to move equipment and forces into position for a renewed offensive, which military analysts have warned could be both long and bloody.The eastern front stretches over some 300 miles from Kharkiv in the north to Mariupol in the south and many of the people living in the region have fled as weeks of shelling have destroyed critical infrastructure, flattened homes and left scores dead.The shelling has increased as Russia moves troops and equipment into position for a full-scale assault. Unlike the precision strikes on military targets in other parts of the country, the indiscriminate bombardments in the east are often directed against homes and infrastructure.On Saturday, a Russian shell hit an oil refinery in the city of Lysychansk in the Luhansk region, setting off a large blaze, according to Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor. “Shelling continues in residential areas of Lysychansk, and locals are asked to remain in shelters,” he wrote in a message posted on social media.In Kharkiv, where Russia is trying to keep Ukrainian forces tied up as its troops try to advance into areas further south, two people were killed and 18 others wounded when what appeared to be guided missiles slammed into a shopping center in the heart of the shattered city.ImageOne person was killed and eight were wounded in Kharkiv in an apparent Russian missile strike on Saturday.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesIn Dnipro, the local government said that a Russian missile had struck an abandoned poultry farm.There were also reports from local and national Ukrainian officials of Russian rocket attacks on Poltava, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv.Even as Ukrainians take stock of the devastation left in the wake of the Russian occupation across the north of their country, the situation in areas under Russian occupation remained grave.Ukrainians also say that Russian forces are trying to cover up evidence of war crimes in places that they control, although witness accounts and statements to that effect from local officials have been impossible to verify as Russian forces have blocked access to outsiders.Local residents have relayed reports of Russian soldiers exhuming the bodies of civilians buried in the yards of residential buildings in Mariupol, and forbidding people to bury or remove the bodies of the dead, according to a statement posted on the City Council’s Telegram channel. Local officials say that Russia is burning the bodies as part of an effort to hide the extent of the slaughter in the city.ImageDamage from the missile strike in Kharkiv on Saturday.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAndrew E.

296,"The following images depict graphic violence.A couple of weeks ago I came across the graphic images of bodies littering the landscape in Bucha, Ukraine, a suburb a few miles west of Kyiv. Bucha was the latest example of Russia’s barbarity in this war, but one of the first things I thought of was Jonestown.In November 1978, Time magazine sent me to that remote settlement in Guyana to check reports that Representative Leo Ryan, a California Democrat, had been killed there while investigating allegations that a group, a cult really, called the People’s Temple was holding people against their will.I was one of the first photographers on the scene. Mr. Ryan had indeed been killed, as had three of my colleagues: Greg Robinson, a photographer for The San Francisco Examiner; Bob Brown, an NBC cameraman; and Don Harris, an NBC correspondent. But that was only the beginning. The bodies of more than 900 other people were strewn around a compound of one-story buildings in a jungle clearing, victims and perpetrators of a mass murder-suicide under the instruction of their maniacal leader, Jim Jones. Children and babies had been murdered by their parents. I photographed a nightmare.ImageA vat of cyanide-laced Flavor Aid among the dead in Jonestown.Credit...David Hume Kennerly/Center for Creative Photography -- University of ArizonaPhotos of Jonestown show the depths of the violence that people can visit on themselves and one another: When susceptible minds fall under the sway of a powerful leader, disaster is sure to follow.Which brings me back to Bucha.As the advance on Kyiv stalled, Russian forces began to torture, rape and kill civilians in Bucha, survivors and investigators say. More than 300 civilians have reportedly been killed; some were left in mass graves, others in the street or in their yards. Many had their hands tied behind them. They were executed.ImageDocumenting the dead in Bucha.Credit...Carol Guzy/ZUMA Press This image of a man with both eyes open is one of the most compelling and disquieting photos to come out of Bucha. It’s an intimate and puzzling image of death, and I’ve never seen anything like it. What did this man see at the moment of his death? Whatever it was, his resolve remained.The images of these atrocities were taken by trusted photojournalists. They are the truth, and a record of the mendacity and brutality of the Russian military. As accusations of war crimes mount, these photos are the documentation the world needs to finally understand what is really happening in Ukraine.In the usual manner of history’s aggressors, the Russian Defense Ministry insists that any photographs and videos that suggest war crimes by Russians in Bucha are fake news and a ‘‘provocation” and that “not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action.”That message may succeed in Vladimir Putin’s Russia — because he has ensured there is no counterpoint — but it will not be believed in places where people are free to see these images: Photographs are a direct line to people, over the heads of officials, pundits and disinformation.ImageThe body of a Russian soldier near Kharkiv, in late February.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesImageA dead soldier near the Smolensk front in 1941.Credit...Dmitri Baltermants /The collection of David Hume Kennerly --Center for Creative Photography -- University of ArizonaWhen I saw Tyler Hicks’s photo of a dead Russian soldier in the snow outside Kharkiv, Ukraine, it immediately reminded me of an image by the great Soviet photographer Dmitri Baltermants, on the Smolensk Front 250 miles from Moscow in 1941. The irony, of course, is that Baltermants’s soldier was fighting real Nazis, and the soldier in Mr. Hicks’s photo only thought he was. Mr. Hicks took this photo the day after Vladimir Putin launched his “special military operation” to “demilitarize and denazify” Ukraine. His picture was among the first of many dead Russian soldiers to follow.Mr. Putin understands the power of photography. That’s why when, for 20 days, The Associated Press photographer Evgeniy Maloletka and his colleague Mstyslav Chernov, a videojournalist, were likely the last international journalists documenting the siege of Mariupol, a port city in southern Ukraine, they were hunted by Russian forces and had to be rescued by the Ukrainian military.ImageThe aftermath of the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol in early March.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressIn the face of ceaseless conflicts, it can sometimes seem as if audiences have become inured to reports or images of suffering. But in my experience, some photographs will always have the power to make us confront horror. As the journalist Nicholas Kristof once told me, “Photos move people the way prose never does.” Evocative images can affect policy, spur action, and every now and then alter the course of history.ImageThe author in Vietnam in 1971.Credit...Center for Creative Photography/University of ArizonaVietnam was my generation’s war. I was 24 when I flew to Saigon, in 1971, as a staff photographer for United Press International, determined to see what was killing my high school classmates. If I hadn’t gone, I don’t think I would have ever forgiven myself. I learned about life and death. I learned that soldiers often welcomed photographers because we take the same risks as they do. I learned to trust my instincts. And I learned firsthand about the power of photography.ImageEaster Sunday in South Vietnam in 1971, photographed by the author.Credit...David Hume Kennerly/Center for Creative Photography -- University of ArizonaImage“Saigon Execution”Credit...Eddie Adams/Associated PressIn 1968, “Saigon Execution,” by Eddie Adams, captured the split-second moment a South Vietnamese general fired a bullet into the head of a Vietcong prisoner in the streets of Saigon. And in 1972, Nick Ut’s “Napalm Girl” immortalized the suffering of a naked 9-year-old, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, who was burned in a napalm attack. Both photos were published on the front pages of newspapers across the United States, and in those vivid images Americans saw the cruelty of the war. Public opinion started to shift. They are still among the greatest photos ever made.ImageSoldiers tried to help a woman, her two children and a family friend after they were hit by Russian shelling in Kyiv, but all died.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesMany of the photographs of the war in Ukraine deserve to live as indelibly on the public record as those photos of Vietnam. We can only see the extent of the Russian-made horror because of these photos and the photographers who have risked, or given, their lives to get them: Lynsey Addario narrowly escaped death in the same mortar attack that killed the subjects of her photo; the body of the Ukrainian photographer and videojournalist Maksim Levin, a frequent contributor to Reuters, was discovered on April 1 in a village north of Kyiv. Mr. Levin was the sixth journalist killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict.I’m getting tired of those endless disclaimers — like the one at the top of this essay — that say, “Warning: Graphic Material.” The best photographs of war might make us want to look away. It’s imperative that we do not.David Hume Kennerly won the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography in 1972 for his pictures of the Vietnam War taken the prior year. He was also President Gerald R.

299,"Austria’s chancellor visited President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday — the first Western leader to see him in person since the Ukraine invasion — and said he came away feeling not only pessimistic about peace prospects but fearing that Mr. Putin intended to drastically intensify the brutality of the war.Describing Mr. Putin as dismissive of atrocities in Ukraine, the visiting chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said it was clear that Russian forces were mobilizing for a large-scale assault in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, the next phase of a war now in its seventh week.“The battle being threatened cannot be underestimated in its violence,” Mr. Nehammer said in a news conference after the 75-minute meeting at Mr. Putin’s residence outside Moscow that the visitor described as blunt and direct.The Austrian chancellor said he had told the Russian president that as long as people were dying in Ukraine, “the sanctions against Russia will stay in place and will be toughened further.”The Kremlin, playing down the meeting’s significance in a terse statement, said only that it was “not long by the standards of recent times.”Even as Mr. Nehammer was visiting, Russian forces were bombarding Ukrainian cities and towns, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said “tens of thousands are dead” in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has been the scene of the most intense destruction of the war.ImageEmergency workers at the site of a destroyed building on Sunday in Mariupol, Ukraine.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersAnd Mr. Putin, despite Russia’s military blunders in the war, and for all the Western efforts to ostracize him, still appeared in control of the crisis. He has severely repressed any dissent and benefited from widespread domestic support, continuing revenues from oil and gas sales to Europe, the implicit backing of China and the refusal of much of the world to join sanctions against Russia.Many commentators in the West had criticized the Austrian chancellor — his country is a member of the European Union but not of NATO — for having visited Moscow at all, seemingly playing into Mr. Putin’s narrative that American-led efforts to isolate Russia would necessarily end in failure.Mr. Nehammer told reporters afterward that he had tried to confront Mr. Putin with the horrors of war and of the war crimes that Russian troops are accused of having committed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha and elsewhere. He said he also had told Mr. Putin about the destroyed Russian tanks he saw on a recent visit to Ukraine, to make clear the enormous loss of life that Russia was suffering.Mr. Nehammer said that Mr. Putin had brushed aside the accusations of war crimes as having been staged by Ukraine.At the end, Mr. Putin told him: “It would be better if it” — the war — “ended soon,” Mr. Nehammer said, but the meaning of those words was unclear, since they could either signal that Mr. Putin was prepared for further peace talks or that he could be readying a quick and brutal assault in the Donbas, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukraine’s military since 2014.“We can have no illusions: President Putin has totally adopted the logic of war, and is acting accordingly,” Mr. Nehammer said. “This is why I believe it is so important to permanently confront him with the facts of the war.”ImageChancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria during a news conference after he met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday at the Russian leader’s residence near Moscow.Credit...Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated PressHow much more brutal the war could become was signaled in an interview with Eduard Basurin, a separatist commander, aired on Russian state television. Mr. Basurin said that with Ukrainian forces ensconced in underground fortifications at a steel plant in Mariupol, storming the redoubt did not make sense. Instead, he said, Russian forces needed to first block the exits and then “turn to the chemical troops who will find a way to smoke the moles out of their holes.”Mr. Putin was silent on Monday but was expected to speak publicly on Tuesday, when he will travel to the Vostochny spaceport in Russia’s far east with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, his ally, to mark the annual Cosmonauts’ Day. The Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has increasingly been framed by Mr. Putin as not against that country, but against the West — specifically, the United States, as the supposed patron of Mr. Zelensky’s government and its aspirations to escape Russia’s sphere of influence as a former Soviet republic.Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said in a Russian television interview that aired on Monday that what the Kremlin calls its “special operation” in Ukraine is aimed at rolling back American influence — which the Russian government characterizes as the root of the world’s ills.“Our special military operation is designed to put an end to the reckless expansion, and the reckless course toward complete dominance, of the United States,” Mr. Lavrov said.The United States and European Union have imposed increasingly severe economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion and are sending weapons to Ukraine’s military. But they do not want to get drawn into a war with Russia. And the European Union remains reluctant to ban Russian oil and natural gas, which remain critical to the bloc’s own economic health.E.U. foreign ministers met on Monday in Luxembourg and the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said that “nothing is off the table, including sanctions on oil and gas.”ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine giving a virtual address before South Korea’s Parliament on Monday.Credit...Pool photo by Chung Sung-JunWhile ministers discussed a possible phaseout of Russian oil, more easily replaceable from other suppliers than gas, the meeting also laid bare the bloc’s divisions. Austria, Hungary and Germany opposed any effort, for now, to restrict Russian gas imports.Still, European Union leaders were expected to approve another 500 million euros in funds to repay member states for sending weapons to Ukraine, which would mean a total of 1.5 billion euros so far — nearly equivalent to the $1.7 billion in weapons that the United States has authorized.Russian troops, having retreated from northern Ukraine after a failed effort last month to reach the capital, Kyiv, have been resupplying and regrouping in Russia and Belarus so they can join the battle in eastern Ukraine. But Western officials said on Monday that effort may still take some time.Ukrainian officials have been warning since last week that civilians in east Ukraine should flee while they can. Mr. Zelensky warned that tens of thousands of Russian troops were preparing a renewed assault there.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.If and when the southern port city of Mariupol finally falls, Russian troops can move north to meet up with Russian troops attempting to move south from Izyum and try to encircle the bulk of Ukraine’s army, which is concentrated further east, said Mathieu Boulègue, an expert on the Russian military at Chatham House, the London research institution.ImageAn armored vehicle carrying separatist, pro-Russian troops in Mariupol on Monday.Credit...ReutersThat is easier said than done, Mr. Boulègue said, as the battered Russian troops await reinforcements. The Ukrainians, he said, were trying to block the Russians and organize a counterattack that would be more complicated than the fighting around Kyiv, which had forced the Russians to retreat.Given the reports of Russian atrocities at Bucha, Kramatorsk, Mariupol and other cities, negotiations between the Ukrainian and Russian governments are on hold.But few believe that the antagonists are ready for real talks, because Mr. Putin needs to show more military gains and because the Ukrainians believe that they can still repel the Russians, said Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO.“The Ukrainians think they have an opportunity not just to prevent Russia from gaining more ground in the east but expelling them from there, while Putin needs to find something he can sell as a victory,” Mr. Daalder said. “So diplomacy is not going anywhere.”If and when talks on a settlement finally occur, Mr. Putin will inevitably be part of them, said François Heisbourg, a French defense expert. Diplomats deal with leaders of governments, no matter how distasteful, he said.The West also hopes that increasing economic pain will encourage Mr. Putin to scale down the war and end it. Russia is already is “deep recession” and its economy is expected to shrink by 11 percent this year, the World Bank reported.ImageThe clothing retailers H&M and Zara have both closed their stores in Russia, including these in Moscow.Credit...Kirill Kudryavtsev/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBut the impact is severe on Ukraine, too. The bank forecast that Ukraine’s economy would shrink by about 45 percent this year because of the Russian invasion and the impact of a “deep humanitarian crisis.”Mr. Putin originally named one goal of the war as the “denazification” of Ukraine, falsely labeling as Nazis those who resist Russian domination. An article on Monday in a Russian state newspaper, Parlamentskaya Gazeta, written by an adviser to the chairman of Russia’s lower house of Parliament, expanded on that concept to define the enemy as “Ukrainian-American neo-Nazism.”The fight also included a “cold war” against enemies of the state inside Russia, the article said, adding: “The denazification of Ukraine is impossible without a parallel denazification of Russia.”It was the latest sign that, even as the war in Ukraine rages, Mr. Putin is priming his security apparatus for an ever-widening intolerance for dissent. The crackdown has accelerated in recent weeks, with pro-war Russians turning in teachers and neighbors who speak out against the war.Last Friday, Russia closed some of the last remaining independent institutions of civil society, including the Carnegie Moscow Center and the Moscow offices of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. It expanded the practice of naming government critics as “foreign agents,” for the first time adding a popular musician to the list: the rapper Ivan Dryomin, 25, who goes by the name Face.ImageThe rapper Ivan Dryomin, who goes by Face, was named a “foreign agent” by the Russian government.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels and Anton Troianovski from Istanbul.

301,"KYIV, Ukraine — Stanislav Aseyev spent two and a half years in a notorious prison run by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, where he said he and other inmates were regularly tortured, beaten, demeaned and forced to wear bags on their heads. Yet, even he was unprepared for the grim scenes of abuse and executions that he witnessed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.“I was still not ready for this,” he said. “I did not think that I would see genocide with my own eyes, despite the fact that I have a lot of experience in this war.”Mr. Aseyev, a 32-year-old journalist, had documented his time in prison in a memoir published in 2020, “The Torture Camp on Paradise Street.” Today, he bears witness to a new brutality, a Russian invasion, and the physical and emotional scars that are being inflicted anew.In Bucha, “the corpses lay in front of every private house,” said Mr. Aseyev, who had traveled there recently with a volunteer military unit to help ensure the safety of the region after Ukrainian forces had pushed the Russians back.Mr. Aseyev had moved to the Kyiv area to put his prison years behind him, but war and its associated traumas found him once more, in February, when missiles whistled into the city’s eastern suburb of Brovary.“I had thought that it was all over, that I still had a very long process ahead to work on it,” he said of the lingering scars in an interview conducted in the back seat of a car because it was too dangerous to speak at his home. “But now it’s all irrelevant, because now the old psychological traumas from captivity are again beginning to slowly make themselves felt.”ImageWidespread destruction could be seen last week across Bucha, Ukraine, a suburb northwest of Kyiv from which Russian forces recently withdrew.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesJerked back to wartime, Mr. Aseyev has also chosen a new way to address his fears and anger. He has taken up arms for the first time in his life, defending his adopted city militarily as part of the Territorial Defense Forces, a volunteer unit in the Ukrainian army.Mr. Aseyev’s story is an extreme version of the one many Ukrainians are experiencing today, as the Russian military spreads violence, indiscriminate and otherwise, throughout the country. His experiences have seen him — someone raised with Russian language and Russian culture, with a worldview relatively sympathetic to Moscow — reject all of that to the extent that he is not only ready but willing to kill Russian soldiers.He was born in the town of Makiivka, just outside Donetsk, the largest city in eastern Ukraine. As a native Russian speaker, he grew up listening to Soviet rock bands like Kino, reading Dostoyevsky in the original Russian and learning history from a predominantly Russian perspective.Before the separatist war that broke out in 2014, he says he was sympathetic to President Vladimir V. Putin’s vision of Ukraine as part of “Russky Mir,” or “Russian World,” a nationalist and chauvinistic ideology focused on the idea of Russia’s civilizational superiority. “I really had such ‘Russky Mir,’ illusions about Putin, Great Russia, all these things,” he said.Those were shattered by his experiences after 2014, just as they are being shattered now for millions of other Ukrainians. He now prefers not to speak Russian, except to talk to his mother.ImageVolunteers with the Territorial Defense Forces receiving weapons training in March, before being deployed to fight against Russian forces near Kyiv.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesIn 2014, Makiivka, a place that Mr. Aseyev has described as “a city of Soviet sleepwalkers,” was occupied by Russian-backed separatist forces loyal to the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Many of his friends signed up to fight on the side of the pro-Moscow rebels, buying the Russian propaganda line that Ukrainian fascists had taken control in Kyiv. Shortly thereafter, he said, he realized that the separatists were the ones committing human rights abuses.In 2015, he started writing about the abuses for Ukrayinska Pravda, a daily newspaper, as well as the U.S. funded RFE/RL outlet and a liberal-leaning newspaper, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, or Mirror Weekly. He continued that line of reporting under a pseudonym for two years, until he was detained on June 2, 2017.Mr. Aseyev was first taken to “The Office,” a prison camp in a group of buildings along a wide boulevard in the center of Donetsk that had served as office space before the war. After beatings and electric shock torture, he said, he spent six weeks in solitary confinement, in a cell so cold that he had to grasp bottles of his own urine to stay warm.Then he was transferred to Izolyatsia prison, named for a former insulation factory — both Russian and Ukrainian languages use the same word for insulation and isolation — that had become a cultural center after the Soviet-era factory went bankrupt. There, Mr. Aseyev says he was beaten and tortured for more than two years, before being released in a prisoner exchange in 2019, just before New Year’s Eve, having spent 962 days inside.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Mr. Aseyev said that his own persecution, and the Russians’ pummeling today of cities around Kyiv and across southern and eastern Ukraine, many of them Russian-speaking areas, belied the Kremlin’s assertion that it went to war to protect ethnic Russians and Russian speakers from the “Nazis” supposedly in control in Kyiv.“They don’t care who they kill,” he said. “I am a Russian speaker, I grew up on Russian culture, on Russian music, books, cinema, even Soviet in a sense.”ImagePro-Russia protesters waving that country’s flag outside the regional parliament building in Donetsk in 2014.Credit...Uriel Sinai for the New York TimesDespite this, he said, “I am definitely considered an enemy by these people, just as those who grew up somewhere in Lviv on completely different values,” he said, referring to the predominantly Ukrainian-speaking city in the country’s west that is the beating heart of Ukrainian nationalism.“For them,” he said of Russia’s leadership, “the state of Ukraine simply does not exist, and that’s all. And everyone who does not agree with this is already an enemy.”Mr. Aseyev spent the years after his release from prison trying to heal from his traumas. Much of that process centered on writing his memoir, which detailed the treatment he and others endured.He described the horrors in a powerful passage from the introduction: “The principal tasks here are surviving after the desire to live has forsaken you and nothing in the world depends on you any longer, preserving your sanity as you teeter on the brink of madness and remaining a human being in conditions so inhuman that faith, forgiveness, hate, and even a torturer locking eyes with his victim become laden with manifold meanings.”In thematic essays, he describes how a father and son were tortured together; how a man was electrically shocked in his anus; cases of rape and forced labor; the way cameras were constantly watching the inmates; and the depravity of Izolyatsia’s commander.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.A collection of his dispatches from Ukraine’s occupied eastern Donbas region, written before his 2017 arrest, was also recently published in English translation by Harvard University Press.When the war began in February, Mr. Aseyev took his mother to the country’s relatively safer west, and then took the train back to the capital. Returning to Kyiv in the first days of the war, he was one of only three people who disembarked at the city’s central station.“There is simply nowhere else to run,” he said. “If we all leave Kyiv, then one way or another we will be crushed in the rest of Ukraine.”In prison, his mother was “constantly” on his mind. “For two and a half years my mother went through hell,” he said, not knowing for long periods if he was dead or alive, and not being able to visit him or communicate with him.While she is safe for now, Mr. Aseyev said he is furious about what she was subjected to, and is ready for revenge. “I will kill them at every opportunity,” he said.ImageUkrainian families trying to get to the next train headed west out of Kyiv and toward Lviv, in early March.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York TimesMr. Aseyev said he was convinced that “as soon as” Russian troops “have the opportunity and infrastructure to build something like Izolyatsia in the occupied territory, of course they will.”He has continued his writing and advocacy for Ukraine even as he goes through military training. He recently visited the newly liberated town of Bucha, the site of numerous alleged atrocities by Russian soldiers, and posted photos on Facebook of a mass grave site.In his memoir, Mr. Aseyev wrote a chapter on how and why he had considered taking his own life in prison.“The choice to take my life, so I thought, was the last freedom I had,” he wrote.In a video message shared by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on his Instagram account, Mr. Aseyev recalled this thought as he spoke about his time in Izolyatsia and implored Western leaders not to be afraid of Russia or Mr. Putin.“They took away everything — relatives, friends, communications, even an old calendar” that had been hanging in his cell, he said. “But they couldn’t take one thing away from me: I was ready to die. This is something that cannot be taken away from a person even when everything else is taken away.”And that, he said, is why Ukraine has stood up to the supposedly superior Russian forces, and why it will ultimately prevail.“This is what our whole country is now,” he said. “We are more willing to die than to give up or lose. And that is why the Russian Federation has already lost in this war.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/world/europe/stanislav-aseyev-ukraine-russia.html

303,"CHISINAU, Moldova – Vova Klever, a young, successful fashion photographer from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, did not see himself in this war.“Violence is not my weapon,” he said.So shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and Ukraine prohibited men of military age from leaving the country, Mr. Klever sneaked out to London.His mistake, which would bring devastating consequences, was writing to a friend about it.The friend and his wife then shared the contents of that conversation on social media. It sparked an online fight that went viral, and Ukrainians all over the internet exploded with anger and resentment.“You are a walking dead person,” one Twitter message said. “I’m going to find you in any corner in the world.”The notion of people — especially men — leaving war-torn Ukraine for safe and comfortable lives abroad has provoked a moral dilemma among Ukrainians that turns on one of the most elemental decisions humans can make: fight or flee.Thousands of Ukrainian men of military age have left the country to avoid participating in the war, according to records from regional law enforcement officials and interviews with people inside and outside Ukraine. Smuggling rings in Moldova, and possibly other European countries, have been doing a brisk business. Some people have paid up to $15,000 for a secret night-time ride out of Ukraine, Moldovan officials said.ImageVolunteers with Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces getting weapons training last month in Kyiv, the capital. Ukraine has prohibited men 18 to 60 from leaving the country.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesThe draft dodgers are the vast exception. That makes it all the more complicated for them — morally, socially and practically. Ukrainian society has been mobilized for war against a much bigger enemy, and countless Ukrainians without military experience have volunteered for the fight. To maximize its forces, the Ukrainian government has taken the extreme step of prohibiting men 18 to 60 from leaving, with few exceptions.All this has forced many Ukrainian men who don’t want to serve into taking illegal routes into Hungary, Moldova and Poland and other neighboring countries. Even among those convinced they fled for the right reasons, some said they felt guilty and ashamed.“I don’t think I can be a good soldier right now in this war,” said a Ukrainian computer programmer named Volodymyr, who left shortly after the war began and did not want to disclose his last name, fearing repercussions for avoiding military service.“Look at me,” Volodymyr said, as he sat in a pub in Warsaw drinking a beer. “I wear glasses. I am 46. I don’t look like a classic fighter, some Rambo who can fight Russian troops.”He took another sip and stared into his glass.“Yes, I am ashamed,” he said. “I ran away from this war, and it is probably my crime.”Ukrainian politicians have threatened to put draft dodgers in prison and confiscate their homes. But within Ukrainian society, even as cities continue to be pummeled by Russian bombs, the sentiments are more divided.A meme recently popped up with the refrain, “Do what you can, where you are.” It’s clearly meant to counter negative feelings toward those who left and assure them they can still contribute to the war effort.

She even went to his wedding. But as the war drew near, she said, Mr. Klever became intensely patriotic and anti-Russian, and said rude things to her husband, who is Russian. When she found out he had avoided service, she was so outraged that she posted on Instagram the comments Mr. Klever made insulting her husband, and said he had spent $5,000 to be smuggled out of Ukraine.“For me, it was a hypocrisy to leave the country and pay money for this,” she explained, adding, “He needs to be responsible for his words.”Mr. Klever, who is in his 20s, fell deeper into an online spat with Ms. Lepina. She and others said he had made insensitive comments about the town of Bucha, the site of major violence and the town she was from. (The comments were made before the atrocities in Bucha were revealed). Mr. Klever was then bombarded with death threats. Some Ukrainians also resented that he used his wealth to get out and called it “cheating.”Responding to emailed questions, Mr. Klever did not deny skipping out on his service and said that he had poor eyesight and had “been through a lot lately.""“You can’t even imagine the hatred,” he said.Mr. Klever gave conflicting accounts of how exactly he exited the country and declined to provide details. But for many other Ukrainian men, Moldova has become the favorite trap door.Moldova shares a nearly 800-mile border with western Ukraine. And unlike Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, Moldova is not part of the European Union, which means it has significantly fewer resources to control its frontiers. It is one of Europe’s poorest countries and has been a hub of human trafficking and organized crime.ImageBorder police officers patrolling near Palanca last week.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesWithin days of the war erupting, Moldovan officials said, Moldovan gangs posted advertisements on Telegram, a popular messaging service in Eastern Europe, offering to arrange cars, even minibuses, to spirit out draft dodgers.Law enforcement officials said the typical method was for the smugglers and the Ukrainians to select a rendezvous point along Moldova’s “green border,” the term used for the unfenced border areas, and meet late at night.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.On a recent night, a squad of Moldovan border guards trudged across a flat, endless wheat field, their boots sinking in the mud, looking for draft dodgers. There was no border post on the horizon, just the faint lights of a Ukrainian village and the sounds of dogs barking in the darkness.Out here, one can just walk into and out of Ukraine.Moldovan officials said that since late February they had broken up more than 20 smuggling rings, including a few well-known criminal enterprises. In turn, they have apprehended 1,091 people crossing the border illegally. Officials said all were Ukrainian men.Once caught, these men have a choice. If they don’t want to be sent back, they can apply for asylum in Moldova, and cannot be deported.But if they do not apply for asylum, they can be turned over to the Ukrainian authorities, who, Moldovan officials said, have been pressuring them to send the men back. The vast majority of those who entered illegally, around 1,000, have sought asylum, and fewer than 100 have been returned, Moldovan officials said. Two thousand other Ukrainian men who have entered Moldova legally have also applied for asylum.Volodymyr Danuliv is one of them. He refuses to fight in the war, though it’s not the prospect of dying that worries him, he said. It is the killing.“I can’t shoot Russian people,” said Mr. Danuliv, 50.ImageVolodymyr Danuliv, a Ukrainian evacuee, at a center for asylum seekers and refugees in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital. He has relatives in the Russian Army and is determined not to join the fight for Ukraine.Credit...Cristian Movila for The New York TimesHe explained that his siblings had married Russians and that two of his nephews were serving in the Russian Army — in Ukraine.“How can I fight in this war?” he asked. “I might kill my own family.”Myroslav Hai, an official with Ukraine’s military reserve, conceded, “There are people who evade mobilization, but their share in comparison with volunteers is not so large.” Other Ukrainian officials said men ideologically or religiously opposed to war could serve in another way, for example as cooks or drivers.But none of the more than a dozen men interviewed for this article seemed interested. Mr. Danuliv, a businessman from western Ukraine, said he wanted no part in the war. When asked if he feared being ostracized or shamed, he shook his head.“I didn’t kill anyone. That’s what’s important to me,” he said. “I don’t care what people say.” What happens when the war ends? How much resentment will surface toward those who left? These are questions Ukrainians, men and women, are beginning to ask.When Ms. Lepina shamed Mr. Klever, she was no longer in Ukraine herself. She had left, too, for France, with her husband. Every day, she said, she wrestles with guilt.“People are suffering in Ukraine, and I want to be there to help them, to support them,” she said. “But at the same time I’m safe and I want to be here.”“It’s a very ambiguous, complicated feeling,” she said.And she knows she will be judged.“Of course there will be some people who divide Ukrainian nationals between those who left and those who stayed,” she said. “I am ready for that.”Siergiej Greczuszkin contributed reporting from Warsaw, and Daria Mychkovska from Przemysl, Poland.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/asia/ukraine-draft-dodgers.html
304,"HUSARIVKA, Ukraine — It was in early March when the spent warhead of a cluster munition rocket landed next to Yurii Doroshenko’s home in eastern Ukraine, having dispensed its lethal bomblets over his village.“They were shelling and it hit the street,” he said.These types of internationally banned weapons have been repeatedly used by the Russian military since it invaded Ukraine in February. Human rights groups have denounced their use. Western leaders have linked their presence to a bevy of war-crimes allegations leveled at Moscow.But the cluster munition that landed to next to Mr. Doroshenko’s house was not fired by Russian forces. Based on evidence reviewed by The New York Times during a visit to the area, it is very likely to have been launched by the Ukrainian troops who were trying to retake the area.Nobody died in that strike in Husarivka, an agricultural hamlet surrounded by wheat fields and natural-gas lines, though at least two people were killed as Ukrainian forces shelled it for the better part of month, targeting Russian forces.As the war approaches its eighth week, both sides have relied heavily on artillery and rockets to dislodge each other. But the Ukrainians’ decision to saturate their own village with a cluster munition that has the capacity to haphazardly kill innocent people underscores their strategic calculation: This is what they needed to do to retake their country, no matter the cost.ImagePart of a Uragan cluster munition that was most likely fired by Ukrainian forces in Husarivka while it was under Russian occupation.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesCluster munitions — a class of weapon comprising rockets, bombs, missiles, mortar and artillery shells — split open midair and dispense smaller bomblets over a wide area. The hazard to civilians remains significant until any unexploded munitions have been located and properly disposed of by experts.The Convention on Cluster Munitions, which took effect in 2010, bans their use because of the indiscriminate harm they can cause to civilians: Humanitarian groups have noted that 20 percent or more of antipersonnel submunitions fail to detonate on impact, yet they can explode later if they are picked up or handled.More than 100 nations have signed the pact, though the United States, Ukraine and Russia have not.“It’s not surprising, but it’s definitely dismaying to hear that evidence has emerged indicating that Ukraine may have used cluster munitions in this current conflict,” said Mary Wareham, advocacy director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch. “Cluster munitions are unacceptable weapons that are killing and maiming civilians across Ukraine.”The New York Times sought comment from the Ukrainian armed forces, which did not immediately provide one. After publication of this article, the military sent the following statement:“The Armed Forces of Ukraine strictly adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law. One of our constant priorities is the security of the civilian population. We do not open fire or destroy civilian objects, nor do we use weapons and methods prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.”Russian troops had seized Husarivka from Ukrainian units in the first few days of March, occupying buildings on its outskirts and near its center. The 220-millimeter Uragan artillery rocket that landed near Mr. Doroshenko’s home — fired from a truck-mounted launcher many miles away — struck on either March 6 or 7, said Mr. Doroshenko, the town’s informal leader.ImageBomb disposal technicians removing an undetonated rocket loaded with cluster munitions from a field in the village of Ridnyi Krai, Ukraine, on April 8. Russian troops have used cluster munitions on several occasions in the conflict.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBy that point, the village was well under Russian control.During a visit around the property and Mr. Doroshenko’s street on Thursday, Times reporters viewed large pieces of the artillery rocket that dispensed the cluster munitions, confirming the type of weapon that had been fired. It landed near the Russian army’s makeshift headquarters in an adjacent farm workshop, residents said, meaning the Russian forces were almost certainly the target.Throughout the occupation, Ukrainian forces incessantly shelled the Russian troops there, and at least two of the same type of cluster munition were lodged in a field by Mr. Doroshenko’s home, just a few hundred yards away from the Russians’ headquarters.The rockets fell around a small neighborhood of a dozen or so single-story homes interspersed with small gardens.As the rockets neared the farm, their warheads — probably carrying 30 antipersonnel bomblets apiece — would have separated from the weapons’ solid rocket motors, breaking open and casting their deadly cargo across the neighborhood.These small munitions each contain the equivalent of about 11 ounces of TNT, slightly less than twice as much as a standard hand grenade.The attack on the Husarivka farm appears to be the first use of a cluster munition by Ukrainian troops since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. In 2015, Ukrainian forces used cluster munitions during the opening months of their war against Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east.ImageA cellar in Husarivka, where at least three skulls were recovered this month. Residents said Russian troops had kept captives in homes along the street where the remains were found.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesWhen confronted with the prospect that the Ukrainian military had shelled his village with cluster bombs, Mr. Doroshenko, 58, seemed indifferent.“I don’t know,” he said. “The main thing is that after those rockets everybody comes out alive.”The hazard posed by small undetonated munitions prevented Times reporters from closely examining all the weapons that landed. They visually verified from a distance two of the three rocket remnants as being Uragan cluster munitions, which leave behind the rocket’s nose cone followed by a long skeletal metal frame that held the bomblets together in flight.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

The danger to civilians is no different under the barrels of Ukrainian artillery, as their forces desperately try to retake the parts of the country under Russian control.ImageLubov Dvoretska, 62, a biology teacher whose husband was killed in a bombing.

And on March 10, it was said that half of Husarivka had left for Chepelivka. Pack up and leave because it will get worse. And then I left.”Ms. Dvoretska fled, but her husband, Olexandr, stayed behind to tend their livestock. Later, residents told her that Olexandr was injured in a mortar strike on March 22 and most likely died the next day.“He was discovered dead in the house on the 23rd, and on the 24th they could barely reach me on the phone to notify me,” she said. “Just as he was, in the same clothes, he was buried inhumanly, like an animal.”Another man, Volodymyr Strokov, was killed during the shelling on March 22, residents said.ImageA resident handing an emergency responder a piece of shrapnel at a bombing site in Bezruky, on the outskirts of Kharkiv, on April 7.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBefore the war, Husarivka had a population of just over 1,000.

305,"In the basement of a battered school in Kharkiv, a dozen residents have taken shelter. In a neighborhood not far away, life has returned to some sense of normalcy. But they choose to stay.By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Natalia YermakPhotographs by Tyler HicksApril 24, 2022KHARKIV, Ukraine — The shelling had gone on so long and had been so frequent that even moments of quiet brought their own kind of terror.The artillery barrages and rocket strikes started when the Russians first invaded in February, 59 days ago, and have not stopped. For those still hiding in the school, every day now brings the same routine: Rise at first light, start the fires, boil water, make tea, cook soup and return to the basement.They cower in the unbearably cold underground, packed together and listening as shells slam Kharkiv, an eastern Ukrainian city of 1.4 million before the war started, which Russian firepower has tried to pound into submission. There were roughly 300 people sheltering in the school in the early days of the war, yet nearly all have fled. Now there are only 12.“Here the people left have nowhere to go and nowhere to come back to,” said Larisa Kuznetsova, 55, one of the school’s inhabitants until recently. “And where shall we move? Who needs us elsewhere?”ImageMore than 300 people sheltered in the school in the early days of the war. Now 12 remain. ImageThe residents of the school basement gathered around a table on Sunday, the Orthodox Easter, for a traditional meal and Easter cakes.Trapped in the dangerous ground between Russian and Ukrainian forces, the 12 people still inside the slanted and dusty basement of Kharkiv Municipal Gymnasium No. 172, as the school is officially called, embody what the war has become for those who do not flee: a test of endurance. Even amid the greatest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, there are people who can’t imagine leaving their home, no matter the cost.They could escape to a safer section of Kharkiv, only a few miles away, yet they stay. One woman refuses to leave her disabled husband and son. The school secretary stays to protect against looting. The humanitarian workers who bring food to the 12 have taken to calling them “the dwarfs.”Even with the risk of a direct strike looming over them, they remain, trying to create a semblance of normalcy. They gathered around a table in the school’s underground on Sunday, the Orthodox Easter, for a traditional meal and Easter cakes.“We served this table so that we could celebrate the holiday, like at home,” said Natalia Afanasenko, 44, the group’s de facto cook.No. 172’s conversion into a bomb shelter began almost as soon as the war started on Feb. 24. Kharkiv, only 30 miles from the Russian border and Ukraine’s second largest city, was attacked immediately. Ms. Kuznetsova, a short, quick-talking neighborhood shopkeeper, and her son, Dmitry, 23, stayed in their apartment for the first five days.ImageThe view from a bombed-out apartment in Saltivka, one of Kharkiv’s most brutalized neighborhoods.ImageThe bedroom of an apartment heavily damaged by Russian bombing. “There was shelling then, but unobtrusively,” she said. “The shops were open. We would wait in line for two hours and buy a lot of canned food.”Then one day, as the mother and son ate lunch, the power went out. Ms. Kuznetsova decided to take a quick half-hour nap. She awoke to three shells slamming into her building, known in the neighborhood as Building 40, shaking its foundation, shattering windows and sending her small family crawling to their bathroom, then to the basement.A few days later, another strike lit Building 40 on fire.“Everybody came out wearing whatever they were in, and the neighbor was coming my way, saying, ‘What the hell are you doing here? Hurry up to the school,’” recounted Ms. Kuznetsova.No. 172 is in the neighborhood of Saltivka, a populated residential area in Kharkiv’s northeastern reaches. It has been shelled incessantly by seemingly every type of artillery in the Russian inventory.The Soviet-style apartment blocks and small shops were built in the late 1960s and ‘70s as Kharkiv expanded after the city’s destruction during World War II. Now Ukrainian howitzers and mortars are positioned nearby, with the apartment towers acting as a shield from incoming Russian fire, locking residents in the middle of an unending duel.The school, constructed in 1995, is what counts as a safe haven for the neighborhood, partly because its basement is below ground, unlike some in the surrounding apartment buildings.ImageLarisa Demyanenko, 52, prays often and has three cats with her under the school.ImageArkadiy Guslistyi, 51, lives in the school.Ms. Kuznetsova and Dmitry arrived there on March 3, when the original hundreds had dwindled to about 70 people. The basement was damp and putrid. The basics, like food and hygiene material, were scavenged from vacated apartments until humanitarian workers started arriving.In charge of this bedraggled colony is Natalia Skvortsova, 48, the school secretary. She and her son, Yevgeny Kryvoruchko, 18, are staying for two reasons. She wants to protect against looting and prevent school records and graduation certificates from being destroyed. Quietly, she’s afraid that Yevgeny, now a university student who spends long hours in the half darkness mastering Rubik’s cubes (his fastest time is nine seconds), might get drafted.“This is how it is,” she said, matter-of-factly.Before the Russian invasion started, No. 172 was a pleasant white-walled educational center with 1,000 students. It had new projectors, a 25-meter pool and lovely large windows.But after at least four rounds of artillery hit the campus, killing one man, most windows are shattered, some classroom doors are torn in half, plaster has sheared off walls and the pool’s water is a murky gray. A school museum exhibit honoring Soviet soldiers who fought in World War II has been picked apart so a German helmet from the conflict could be used for protection in the basement.“It’s terrifying living here,” Yevgeny said. “Yes, I want to leave. But my family is here, how could I?”As February turned to March, and March to April, the exodus from No. 172 slowly gathered pace.“Whoever could leave, left,” said Valeriy Gretskykh, 67, one of the final 12.Today, Kharkiv is still under relentless bombardment, yet only a few miles away from Saltivka life has returned, somewhat. Some shops are open, traffic lights are on and city workers take out the trash at regular intervals. Saltivka remains the hardest hit neighborhood, and with some modicum of normalcy so close, the resistance to evacuate can easily be seen as baffling.ImageShopping and residential areas of Kharkiv were attacked by Russian forces last week. ImageThe view from an apartment near the school. The school residents haven’t showered in months, resorting to baby wipes and bottled water. Plumbing is nonexistent. Power comes from a small generator that runs a few hours every couple days and beds are constructed from school desks and gym mats. For entertainment, they watch old VHS tapes, including school graduations and the documentary “Joseph Stalin: The Last Years, the Last Days.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“We don’t watch heavy films about war,” said Olga Altukhova, 66, a retired saleswoman whose birthday on April 17 was marked by a bouquet of tulips.Ms. Altukhova has refused to evacuate because her disabled husband and mentally disabled son are still inside nearby Building 40 and physically can’t leave. Most every hour, she leaves the basement and talks to her husband as he leans out the window from the sixth floor.The fear of leaving is also fueled by the unknown. The 12 have heard worrying stories about those who have fled.“I was speaking to a friend who moved to another part of Kharkiv on the phone yesterday,” said Ms. Kuznetsova. “She says, ‘We are eating plain noodles now, nothing is left and the volunteers won’t bring anything after we call them.’”Indeed, No. 172’s location — practically on the front line — has meant frequent visits from humanitarian aid organizations and nonprofits.ImageHumanitarian workers distributing aid to Ludmila Gretskykh, 72, and others living at the school on Sunday.ImageThe morning routine involves making tea and soup before returning to the basement.“We are fed amazingly,” Ms. Kuznetsova added. “A lot of people who stay here are eating things now that they weren’t able to eat during the peaceful life.”No. 172 has so much donated bread that much of it goes bad. So every day one resident breaks a loaf and feeds a gang of pigeons, who take off briefly when artillery comes close, before returning to their meal.The residents also help take care of people in the neighborhood, acting as a distribution point for those who won’t leave their apartments. People take food, toiletries and secondhand clothes from the school, which Ms. Altukhova lists in a log book and then signs out to whoever comes by during the pauses in shelling.For the past week, leading up to Orthodox Easter on Sunday, the challenge was gathering the necessary ingredients for a proper lunch, a job that fell to Ms. Afanasenko, 44, the designated cook.By Sunday she had what she needed after racing to her apartment: mushrooms and canned olives that she had kept since last fall, mayonnaise stored months in advance and onions she had watered outside the basement. Volunteers brought eggs, cakes and, two days before the holiday, holy water.In the half-dark of the basement, with sunflower-printed napkins and a table arrangement of tulips picked from the neighborhood, the residents of No. 172 raised paper cups of wine and hugged one another.“When it all ends, we’ll just visit our homes,” Ms. Altukhova joked. “And we’ll be living here!”ImageYevgeny Kryvoruchko, 18 and a university student, spends long hours in the half darkness mastering Rubik’s cubes.Dimitry Yatsenko contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/24/world/europe/ukraine-shelling-kharkiv.html
306,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to give one of his most high-profile speeches since the war began when he addresses the United Nations Security Council by video-link on Tuesday.With three permanent members of the Security Council — Britain, France and the United States — firmly in his corner, Mr. Zelensky was expected to make the case that Russian forces have committed war crimes, as evidence emerges of civilian killings in the suburbs of Kyiv.But Russia and its ally China are also permanent members of the council, holding veto power over any measures it might take. Ten nonpermanent members also have a say: Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway and the United Arab Emirates.Here’s what you need to know ahead of the meeting:How does the Security Council work?The 15-nation Security Council is the most powerful U.N. body. Its responsibility is to protect and maintain international peace, and it has the power to enforce decisions that member states are obligated to follow under the U.N. Charter.Once a threat to peace is brought before the council, the first step is to push for a resolution by “peaceful means,” which includes investigations, mediation or appointing a special envoy. If the threat is not resolved, economic sanctions, the severance of diplomatic relations, travel bans, collective military action and arms embargoes are among the last measures the Council can enforce. The Council can also dispatch peacekeeping forces.What could happen at the meeting today?It is unlikely the council will agree on any measures against Russia, as Russia is almost certain to veto any resolution on Ukraine as a permanent council member. But Mr. Zelensky is likely to demand that allies supply his county with more weapons and further isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The meeting will be a prominent venue for the nations aligned with Ukraine to make impassioned pleas and for Russia to issue sharp denials of atrocities.In February, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations vetoed a Security Council resolution written by the United States and its allies that condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, used his speech to criticize the United States for invading Iraq in 2003.Who will support Russia?China, an increasingly important Russian ally, has avoided any criticism of Russia since the war started and has painted Russia as a long-suffering victim of the West. In the council vote in February, it abstained, while calling on Western nations to listen to Russia’s concerns.Among the 10 rotating members, Brazil and Gabon also have close ties to Russia. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil flew to Moscow right before the invasion, and has taken a position of neutrality on the war. Gabon, one of Africa’s largest oil producers, has ties with Russia dating back to the Soviet Union.What about the other members of the council?Ireland and Norway are likely to join other Western democracies in backing Ukraine. Ghana has deep ties with the United States and will also likely support the Western position.India has tried to maintain relations with Russia while not antagonizing the United States, and its position in the conflict has been harder to discern. In February, India invoked its decades-old ties with Russia when it voted to abstain from the Security Council resolution. The United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally in the Middle East, also abstained in February’s vote.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/un-security-council-russia-ukraine.html
307,"When Marina Ermoshkina, a Russian TV presenter, learned that employees at a Chanel store in Dubai had refused to sell a high-end bag to a Russian customer, after asking her to sign papers attesting that she would not wear the bag in Russia, she reacted in shock.Ms. Ermoshkina, 28, bought a pair of gardening scissors, took a video of herself as she cut her Chanel bag in half and posted it to Instagram.“This is Russophobia,” she said in a phone call from Moscow. “This is the purest form of discrimination.”Hundreds of thousands of people saw her video, which was also broadcast on Russian television. Soon afterward, Victoria Bonya, a Russian social media influencer with 9.3 million Instagram followers, followed suit, taking a pair of scissors to a Chanel bag that sells for thousands of dollars.“If Chanel house does not respect the clients, why do we have to respect Chanel house?” she said as she butchered her bag from the iconic French brand on video.Chanel, like many international companies, suspended operations in Russia in response to President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to temporarily closing stores and suspending deliveries in Russia, Chanel also began asking customers in its global stores to attest that the items they were purchasing would not be used in Russia. In a statement, the company said that it was attempting to comply with European Union and Swiss sanctions that prohibit the “sale, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, of luxury goods to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia.” The prohibition, the company said, applies to luxury goods whose value exceeds 300 euros per item (about $326), which applies to most of Chanel’s products.This angered Ms. Ermoshkina, who said that while withdrawing from Russia was the company’s choice, its policy against customers bringing items into the country is discriminatory and humiliating.“If all the women are the same, why does Chanel discriminate against women for their nationality?” she said.Chanel declined to comment on the reactions of the Russian celebrities, but in the statement, it apologized “for any misunderstanding this may have caused, as welcoming all our clients, regardless of where they come from, is a priority for Chanel.” The company acknowledged that “this process of walking through the law has caused disappointment to some of our clients.”Ms. Ermoshkina said she was glad Chanel apologized, but its response did not fully satisfy her. She has put up for sale all her other Chanel belongings and said she intends to donate the profits to an association that she said helps the people of Donbas, the region of eastern Ukraine that is home to many Russian-speaking people.Other influencers have joined her in refusing to wear Chanel clothes and accessories. Some have reposted her words: “Not a single bag, not a single thing is worth my love for my motherland.”Among them is the Russian D.J. Katya Guseva, who had always dreamed of owning a Chanel bag, like the Hollywood celebrities she admired. But she recently told her 500,000 Instagram followers that she no longer needed that bag. In a WhatsApp message, she wrote: “Without Chanel we will continue to live perfectly.”Valeriya Safronova contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/europe/chanel-russian-influencers-ukraine.html
308,"KYIV, Ukraine — In Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, amid the deadly rumble of heavy Russian artillery, there is much that feels familiar. Not least a terrible feeling of dread.Nearly 30 years ago I was in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, a territory in southern Russia that dared declare independence from Moscow as the Soviet Union was breaking apart. The Chechens paid heavily for their presumption. The Russian army twice invaded and twice flattened the city in what has become a familiar Russian playbook for imposing control over outlying regions of the former Russian empire and bludgeoning people into submission.Ukraine is very different from Chechnya, which was a small territory of just one million people in the North Caucasus. Ukraine is a sovereign nation with a population of more than 40 million, an armed force of over 200,000 troops, and a capital city of three million or more inhabitants.But Chechnya’s experience is worth recalling since it was the first time we saw Vladimir V. Putin develop his game plan to reassert Russian dominion wherever he wanted. His methods are brute force and terror: the bombing and besieging of cities, deliberate targeting of civilians, and the abduction and jailing of local leaders and journalists and their replacement by loyal quislings. The tactics are straight out of Stalin’s playbook, as former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright wrote shortly before her death.The war in Chechnya began with a shocking display of Russian incompetence. On New Year’s Eve in 1994, Russian troops were sent blundering into Grozny. Largely composed of conscript soldiers who were ignorant of what to expect, the force drove long columns of tanks and armor into the city in what was intended to be a swift overthrow of the Chechen leadership.ImageRussian soldiers near Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, in December 1994.Credit...Ivan Shlamov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThey were met by highly motivated units of Chechen fighters, armed with anti-tank rockets, who ambushed their columns, trapping and burning hundreds of Russian soldiers and armor in one night. An entire brigade, the Maikop brigade, was wiped out almost to a man.There was a stunned silence in Russia in the days that followed as the leadership took stock of what had happened and the army sent in reinforcements. The Chechens celebrated their victory and let their prisoners telephone their mothers back home in Russia, calling on Moscow to withdraw its troops. But the lull did not last.The Russian army moved to flank Grozny on three sides and unleashed a terrifying onslaught of air and artillery strikes on the city. Their forces smashed the leafy suburbs, the industrial parks and then residential districts, block by block, moving in on the ground bit by bit as they forced the Chechen fighters to retreat under overwhelming bombardment. I saw it close up from both sides, reporting from behind Russian lines as their big guns pounded the city, and running the gamut of bombs and shells to reach the bunkers where the civilian population lived under siege. A modern, European city became a ravaged moonscape. I remember how buildings were shorn in half, and the contents of people’s lives spilled out of their apartments into the open air.The Chechen fighters were ubiquitous, racing in civilian cars to the frontline, running through back streets and destroyed buildings. They became master urban guerrillas and held out for weeks against overwhelming odds. They had widespread support from the civilian population, which was angered by Moscow’s use of brute force. A Muslim people, the Chechens had suffered oppression and deportation under Stalin and had a long history of resistance to Russian rule.When the Russians found a particularly obstinate defense, they would drop lethal cluster bombs that cut through anyone or any vehicles on the streets, whether combatants or pensioners trying to collect water or fleeing civilians.After three months Russian forces took the city center and soldiers sat on plastic chairs guarding a wasteland of destroyed buildings, gouged earth and stricken tree stumps. The fight moved to the southern suburbs, where Russian forces destroyed the last resistance with bunker-busting bombs, which crashed through eight-story buildings right into basements full of civilians, and fuel-air bombs, which exploded above the rooftops and spread a powerful shock wave.ImageA wrecked tank and a trolley bus burning on a Grozny street during fighting in November 1994.Credit...Ivan Shlamov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThere was much in the experience that echoes in Ukraine today. Even though nearly 30 years have intervened, it is staggering to see Russia employ many of the same tactics — and mistakes — in Ukraine. Despite the hard lessons learned in Chechnya, and in Afghanistan before that, Russian troops drove down the main highways with their tanks and fuel trucks in an attempt to seize control of the Ukrainian capital in the first weeks of March.Ukrainian troops were waiting and mounted repeated ambushes. They destroyed tanks and armored vehicles, creating such a pileup that they blocked the Russian advance. Scores of Russian soldiers were killed and taken prisoner. Survivors were forced to escape into the surrounding woods. Other tank columns were destroyed on the eastern approaches to Kyiv.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.There followed something of a lull. The city breathed again. A few cafes even reopened.Now, in the second month of the war, Ukrainian officials say the Russians have turned their focus away from an assault on the capital for now. But Western analysts warn that Kyiv remains very much a target, and we are already witnessing horrific bombardment of other cities around the country.ImageChechen fighters in Grozny in January 1995.Credit...Alexander Nemenov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEven as many Russian forces have pulled back from Kyiv to regroup, others have already spread out and begun flanking the city. Among the miles-long Russian armored column that had advanced on the capital, military analysts identified multiple rocket launchers, heavy artillery and even fuel-air weapons. Heavy fighting is unrelenting in several northern suburbs and the city has come under almost nightly, and more recently daily, cruise missile and artillery strikes.Twice in the last two weeks the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has ordered a 36-hour-long curfew, ordering all civilians to stay indoors for two nights and a day as military commanders warned of mounting danger.“Please stay at home, it will be much more safe,” Mr. Klitschko pleaded last week at an open air news conference as air raid sirens sounded across the city. A former world heavyweight boxing champion, he tried to prepare his shocked people for an extended fight.“We cannot give an answer of how long will be this war,” he said. “We hope it is weeks. I hope not years.”Even as Kyiv braces for the worst, Russian forces have been pounding Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv; the port city of Mariupol; the southern city of Mykolaiv; and the northern town of Chernihiv. Thwarted from seizing them in the first days of the war, the Russian military has pounded them from afar, steadily demolishing infrastructure and buildings, including hospitals, bomb shelters and schools, even while thousands of civilians are trapped inside.ImageGrozny residents in March 1995.Credit...Alexander Nemenov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“They are an artillery army really,” Samuel Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, a British research body, said of the Russian military. “Artillery is the first response to most problems whether they are fighting in a field, mountains or a city. The result of this, in the latter case, is a flattened city and civilian casualties.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The Russians were trying to advance, “but their wheels are spinning,” he said.He was derisive about the Russian armed forces. “They have stupid tactics from the time of the Russian empire, they have not changed,” he said. “Their most important tactic is throwing bodies into the battle. They do not care about their own soldiers.”ImageA Chechen veteran and commander of the Sheikh Mansur battalion, Muslim Cheberloevsky, this month in Kyiv, Ukraine.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesThere is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens. As Russian troops gained control on the ground in Chechnya, they crushed any further dissent with arrests and filtration camps and by turning and empowering local protégés and collaborators.After unleashing horrendous firepower, the decisive blow exerted against Chechnya was the use of loyalist Chechens to impose control. Six years into the war, Mr. Putin turned the chief mufti of Chechnya to betray the rebel cause. The mufti’s son, Ramzan Kadyrov, became Mr. Putin’s chief henchman and has supplied Chechen fighters to support Russian forces in the wars in Syria and now Ukraine.There are already signs of such methods in Ukraine: the arrest and disappearance of local officials, detentions and threats against local journalists and the reported mass evacuation of civilians to Russia.The methods applied by Russian proxies over the last eight years in the separatist districts of eastern Ukraine — their rigid suppression and notorious prison — are as good an indication as any of the way the country could be run under Russian occupation.A Canadian diplomat and politician, Chris Alexander, who served in Canada’s embassy in Moscow at the height of the Chechen war, warned too of worse to come.“The only danger to Ukrainians at this point are Aleppo/Grozniy-style massed indirect fires,” he wrote to me. “This is not over — far from it.”ImageGrozny in 1995.Credit...Pascal Guyot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-chechnya-grozny-ukraine.html
309,"Administration officials and lawmakers stressed on Sunday that the United States was not seeking regime change in Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine despite President Biden’s comment that the Russian leader “cannot remain in power.”Capping a series of diplomatic summits in Europe, Mr. Biden delivered a speech on Saturday in Poland about the war in Ukraine. An apparently ad-libbed remark at the conclusion of his address — “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” — quickly eclipsed the rest of his speech.Government officials — from the White House to senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill — were quick to say that the remark was not intended as a call for a regime change, underscoring the precarious effort to punish Russia for attacking Ukraine while avoiding an escalation in the war.On Sunday, U.S. officials were still trying to walk back and clarify the comment.“We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told journalists in Jerusalem after meeting with Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid. “In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russian people.”Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told CNN’s “State of the Union” that Mr. Biden’s remarks were “a principled human reaction” to the Ukrainian refugees he had met in Warsaw. But, she insisted, “the U.S. does not have a policy of regime change in Russia. Full stop.”Senior lawmakers maintained a similar position on Sunday, with Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, saying he wished Mr. Biden “would stay on script.”Mr. Risch said that even suggesting regime change would inevitably “cause a huge problem,” calling the remark a “horrendous gaffe” in an otherwise good speech.“The administration has done everything they can to stop escalating — there’s not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for a regime change,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.”“I’ll walk it back right now — that is not the policy of the United States of America,” he added. “Please, Mr. President, stay on script.”Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the comment “plays into the hands of the Russian propagandists and plays into the hands of Vladimir Putin,” though he described the speech as “very strong, despite the ad-lib at the end.”The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, echoed comments from the White House.“It is up to the Russian people to determine who is going to be in power in the Kremlin,” he told CNN.Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that “the fact is, anytime the United States has said — spoke out for a regime change, it hasn’t worked out so well.”“I know it was off the cuff, but whatever the president says, it carries a lot of weight,” Mr. McCaul told CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said the remark threatened to overshadow the push to send additional military assistance and other aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/world/europe/biden-putin-speech-reaction.html

311,"WASHINGTON — A Russian missile strike on Sunday in western Ukraine near the Polish border, which has become a transit point for weapons being sent to Ukrainian forces, raised new concerns about whether Russia might attack NATO territory to stop or destroy the shipments.Such an attack could dramatically expand the conflict. The arms — which include machine guns, tactical drones and antitank missiles — have passed through Poland and Romania, both NATO members, and an attack on either country would activate the alliance’s collective-defense provision, known as Article 5. Speaking in Warsaw on Saturday, President Biden said the United States had a “sacred obligation” to honor Article 5.The prospect of direct conflict with the nuclear-armed NATO alliance provides President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with a powerful disincentive.But modern history, including the Soviet Union’s experience in Afghanistan in the 1980s, shows that even in the absence of a possible nuclear war, invading powers have been surprisingly hesitant to target countries that provide adversaries with lethal support.“There just historically has always been a reluctance to broaden these conflicts to surrounding nations,” said Bruce Hoffman, a counterinsurgency expert and a professor at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, seemed to threaten such an attack, recently telling the state-run news outlet RT that “any cargo moving into Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game.”ImageGerman vehicles were prepared to be moved to Romania in February.Credit...Michael Probst/Associated PressA Russian strike on supply points in eastern Poland or northern Romania would be a departure from recent norms. The United States may have carpet-bombed Laos and invaded Cambodia during the Vietnam War in hopes of smashing Viet Cong supply lines and sanctuaries, but the approach proved both politically costly and strategically ineffective.Mr. Hoffman and others cite several examples pointing the other way, including the Soviet and U.S. wars in Afghanistan. In both cases, Soviet and American leaders feared the costs and potential consequences of expanding already difficult conflicts.For Mr. Putin, the stakes would be high. With his army foundering, some analysts say a vigorous NATO supply campaign could lead to a Russian military failure, with potentially disastrous implications for him.“When an insurgency has access to cross-border sanctuary and safe haven and a flow of arms, it is almost impossible to defeat,” Mr. Hoffman said.Soviet leaders learned that lesson the hard way in the 1980s, after Moscow invaded Afghanistan and struggled to control the country amid fierce resistance by Islamist insurgents known as mujahedeen. A C.I.A. program soon turned western Pakistan into a staging ground for the mujahedeen fighters, eventually providing them with more than $2 billion in equipment, training and weapons — including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, which the United States is now shipping to Ukraine.Pakistani officials worried that the Soviets might respond with cross-border attacks on their territory, but the United States assured them — correctly, as it turned out — that Moscow did not want to devote even more troops to an already unpopular war.“The Soviets certainly had the military capability to strike the bases either through airstrikes or ground forces, or both,” said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now with the Brookings Institution and wrote a book about the covert campaign to support the Afghan fighters. But, he added, “Moscow did not want the war to expand.”Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.Some analysts say that, in this case, Mr. Putin may lack the troops needed to complete a takeover of Ukraine, never mind to storm into or seal the border of a second country.But Mr. Putin enjoys more sophisticated and accurate weaponry than his Soviet predecessors, making it easier to strike supply hubs for Ukrainian forces from a distance.Mr. Putin may also doubt that NATO would treat a limited, lightning strike from the air on its territory as an act of war, especially given Mr. Biden’s warnings that direct conflict with Russia could lead to World War III. Even so, some doubt that Mr. Putin would take such a risk.One reason is that it is “very, very difficult for countries to seriously interdict supply lines,” said Seth Jones, a former official at U.S. Special Operations Command now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Limited striking of targets in Ukraine, or in countries like Poland, is not going to meaningfully stop the flow.”Mr. Putin could try a step short of overt military action. Within months of Russia’s 2014 intervention in eastern Ukraine, in support of pro-Moscow separatist rebels, two large explosions destroyed a pair of arms depots in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.Officials in both countries have since attributed the attacks to sabotage by Russia’s military intelligence arm, the G.R.U. The presumed motive was to prevent the weapons from reaching their destination: Ukrainian fighters battling the Russian-backed separatists.In a detailed investigation of the events, the open-source news outlet Bellingcat said the attacks were “part of a longer-term G.R.U. operation aimed at disrupting Ukraine’s capabilities to procure weapons and munitions critical to its defense against Russian troops and Russia-sponsored militants in the war in eastern Ukraine.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J.

Bush never moved seriously against cross-border sanctuaries the Taliban had established in Pakistan. Sealing off those locations might have required doubling the number of U.S. troops in the country from around their peak levels of the war, according to Gian Gentile, a retired U.S. Army colonel and historian at the RAND Corporation. That was never in the cards.ImageThe remains of the Retroville Mall in Kyiv, Ukraine, last Monday.Credit...Lynsey Addario for The New York Times“The Americans were not willing to escalate militarily,” said Husain Haqqani, a Pakistani ambassador to Washington during the Obama administration. Even when President Barack Obama ordered a raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011, Mr. Haqqani added, “a big concern was, what if Pakistan retaliates and this becomes some kind of full-blown war?”In 2007, U.S. officials, including Mr. Bush himself, said that Iran was equipping Iraq’s insurgent Shiite militias with improvised rockets and deadly roadside bombs that featured an explosively formed penetrator, which could punch through most U.S. vehicles.Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, was among those who called for a military response, saying that Iranian leaders could not “have immunity for training and equipping people to come in and kill Americans.” Mr. Bush, who already had two wars on his hands, never struck.During the Korean War, the United States even shied away from bringing the fight to an enemy that was directly attacking its troops. After U.S. forces advanced near North Korea’s border with China in late 1950, Beijing sent hundreds of thousands of troops south to push the Americans back. Gen. Douglas MacArthur sought permission to bomb bases, bridges and factories in China. But President Harry S. Truman rejected the idea, heeding the advice of other commanders who said an expanded war could draw in the Soviet Union and leave the United States outmatched in the region.The Soviets nevertheless sent fighter jets to help battle the U.S. Air Force over Korea. Although Moscow denied its involvement, even marking its planes in North Korean colors, the United States suspected the truth — but chose to look the other way.Perhaps the most obvious counterexample is the Vietnam War. Two U.S. presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, ordered major military operations beyond Vietnam’s borders, in Laos and Cambodia, to cut off the jungle supply routes and bases collectively known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.The impoverished rural nations could do little to defend themselves. And the operations carried a devastating punch. More than two million tons of bombs fell on Laos alone. But, Mr. Jones noted: “It didn’t work. America still lost that war.”John Ismay contributed reporting.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/russia-ukraine-nato-weapons.html
312,"BUDAPEST — Savoring the election victory of a rare European leader who has not condemned him as a war criminal, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday congratulated Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary for winning a fourth term and said he looked forward to an expansion of “partnership ties.”At a time when Russia’s relations with the European Union and the United States are unraveling over the war in Ukraine, Hungary, a member of the European bloc, has mostly sat on the fence in response to the Russian invasion, in part to avoid upsetting a natural gas deal cemented by Mr. Orban during talks with Mr. Putin in Moscow shortly before Russia invaded.A thumping victory in Sunday’s election for Mr. Orban’s party, Fidesz, suggested that the Hungarian leader would stick with a policy strongly endorsed by voters.But following a vote that independent election observers said was unfairly tilted in the governing party’s favor, there is also growing pressure on Mr. Orban to change course or risk not only alienating Hungary’s allies but losing billions of dollars in badly needed funding from the European Union for failing to uphold the rule of law.Guy Verhofstadt, a prominent liberal in the European Parliament, described the election as “a dark day for liberal democracy, for Hungary and the E.U., at a perilous time.”Mr. Putin got more mixed news from elections Sunday in Serbia, where Aleksandar Vucic, the country’s populist pro-Russia president, won re-election, according to preliminary official results issued on Monday. But it looked as if President Vucic could lose his increasingly authoritarian grip on power after his governing party failed to win a clear majority in Parliament.The Kremlin congratulated Mr. Vucic nonetheless, calling for a strengthening of what it described as a “strategic partnership” in the interests of “brotherly Russian and Serb people.”ImageAleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s pro-Russia president, won re-election on Sunday, but could lose his grip on power after his governing party failed to win a clear majority in Parliament.Credit...Andrej Cukic/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Orban’s Fidesz party has been divided over how to respond to Russia’s aggression, with its more traditional nationalist wing, steeped in the history of Hungary’s own past suffering at Russia’s hands, uncomfortable with cozying up to Mr. Putin.But its hopes that Mr. Orban, who went from being an anti-Kremlin liberal firebrand in 1989 to Mr. Putin’s closest partner in Europe, might again change direction after the election seems to have been diminished by the scale of his party’s victory. It won more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament while an openly pro-Putin, far-right party, Our Homeland Movement, secured enough votes to enter Parliament for the first time.“Putin is right. Ukraine is getting what it deserves,” Janos Horvath, a supporter of the far-right party, said after casting his vote. Ukraine, he said, echoing a favorite Kremlin talking point, mistreats its ethnic minorities, including Russians and Hungarians, and “must be stopped.”The crushing defeat of Mr. Orban’s opponents, who campaigned on pledges to show more solidarity with Ukraine and Hungary’s allies, makes it unlikely that Hungary will now join NATO and the European Union in condemning Mr. Putin over his military onslaught or in supplying weapons to help Ukraine defend itself. Hungary, unlike Poland, has steadfastly refused to let weapons pass through its territory to Ukraine.While increasingly isolated from his foreign allies, Mr. Orban won strong domestic support for his neutral stance on the war, turning what had initially threatened to become an electoral liability into a vote-getter. He did this through relentless misrepresentation of his opponents’ position, deploying a vast apparatus of loyal media outlets to convince voters that his rivals wanted to send Hungarian troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia, something that nobody has suggested doing.ImageSupporters of Mr. Orban’s Fidesz party on Sunday.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesAt the opposition’s final rally in Budapest on election eve, Fidesz activists masquerading as journalists presented the opposition’s main candidate, Peter Maki Zay, with a white T-shirt emblazoned with a red target, shouting that this was what Hungary would become if he won. A video of the encounter was later posted online by Fidesz-friendly media outlets, which repeatedly cast the election as a choice between “war and peace.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

His complaints echo those of Mr. Putin with regard to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine and have made Mr. Orban more sympathetic than other European leaders to Russia’s narrative of the war.Hungarians living in Ukraine number only around 150,000 but they form part of a much larger diaspora that, granted the right to vote in Hungarian elections and lavished with funding by Budapest, has become an important source of support for Fidesz, and a constant source of friction between Hungary and its neighbors.In a sign that Fidesz, emboldened by its election victory, would press on with supporting ethnic Hungarians in countries like Ukraine, Mr. Orban’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, on Monday thanked the 315,000 voters outside Hungary who he said had cast a vote. “We stand up for our Hungarian compatriots beyond the borders,” he said. “They can count on us just like we can count on them in important decisions like this one,” a reference to Sunday’s election.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/hungary-orban-election-putin-ukraine.html
313,"WASHINGTON — As Russian troops retreat from northern Ukraine and focus operations on the country’s east and south, the Kremlin is struggling to scrape together enough combat-ready reinforcements to conduct a new phase of the war, according to American and other Western military and intelligence officials.Moscow initially sent 75 percent of its main ground combat forces into the war in February, Pentagon officials said. But much of that army of more than 150,000 troops is now a spent force, after suffering logistics problems, flagging morale and devastating casualties inflicted by stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, military and intelligence officials say.There are relatively few fresh Russian troops to fill the breach. Russia has withdrawn the forces — as many as 40,000 soldiers — it had arrayed around Kyiv and Chernihiv, two cities in the north, to rearm and resupply in Russia and neighboring Belarus before most likely repositioning them in eastern Ukraine in the next few weeks, U.S. officials say.The Kremlin is also rushing to the east a mix of Russian mercenaries, Syrian fighters, new conscripts and regular Russian army troops from Georgia and easternmost Russia.Whether this weakened but still very lethal Russian force can overcome its blunders of the first six weeks of combat and accomplish a narrower set of war aims in a smaller swath of the country remains an open question, senior U.S. officials and analysts said.ImageBorodianka, a Ukrainian commuter town near Kyiv, was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes. Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times“Russia still has forces available to outnumber Ukraine’s, and Russia is now concentrating its military power on fewer lines of attack, but this does not mean that Russia will succeed in the east,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said on Monday.“The next stage of this conflict may very well be protracted,” Mr. Sullivan said. He added that Russia would probably send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east,” and continue to rain rockets, missiles and mortars on Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Lviv and other cities.U.S. officials have based their assessments on satellite imagery, electronic intercepts, Ukrainian battlefield reports and other information, and those intelligence estimates have been backed up by independent analysts examining commercially available information.Earlier U.S. intelligence assessments of the Russian government’s intent to attack Ukraine proved accurate, although some lawmakers said spy agencies overestimated the Russian military’s ability to advance quickly.As the invasion faltered, U.S. and European officials have highlighted the Russian military’s errors and logistical problems, though they have cautioned that Moscow’s ability to regroup should not be underestimated.The Ukrainian military has managed to reclaim territory around Kyiv and Chernihiv, attacking the Russians as they retreat; thwarted a ground attack against Odesa in the south and held on in Mariupol, the battered and besieged city on the Black Sea. Ukraine is now receiving T-72 battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other heavy weapons — in addition to Javelin antitank and Stinger antiaircraft missiles — from the West.Anticipating this next major phase of the war in the east, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles from Pentagon stocks — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been very effective in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.ImageBurned-out remains of Russian armored vehicles littered a forest road near Dmytrivka, Ukraine, on Saturday.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesAmerican and European officials believe that the Russian military’s shift in focus is aimed at correcting some of the mistakes that have led to its failure to overcome a Ukrainian army that is far stronger and savvier than Moscow initially assessed.But the officials said it remained to be seen how effective Russia would be in building up its forces to renew its attack. And there are early signs that pulling Russian troops and mercenaries from Georgia, Syria and Libya could complicate the Kremlin’s priorities in those countries.Some officials say Russia will try to go in with more heavy artillery. By focusing its forces in smaller geographic area, and moving them closer to supply routes into Russia, Western intelligence officials said, Russia hopes to avoid the logistics problems its troops suffered in their failed attack on Kyiv.Other European intelligence officials predicted it would take Russian forces one to two weeks to regroup and refocus before they could press a major offensive in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. Western officials said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was desperate for some kind of win by May 9, when Russia traditionally celebrates the end of World War II with a big Victory Day parade in Red Square.“What we are seeing now is that the Kremlin is trying to achieve some kind of success on the ground to pretend there is a victory for its domestic audience by the 9th of May,” said Mikk Marran, the director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service.Mr. Putin would like to consolidate control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, and establish a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula by early May, a senior Western intelligence official said.Russia has already moved air assets to the east in preparation for the renewed attack on the heart of the Ukrainian military, and has increased aerial bombardment in that area in recent days, a European diplomat and other officials said.ImageEmergency workers removing debris on Wednesday in Kharkiv, Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“It’s a particularly dangerous scenario for the Ukrainians now, at least on paper,” said Alexander S. Vindman, an expert on Ukraine who became the chief witness in President Donald J. Trump’s first impeachment trial. “In reality, the Russians haven’t performed superbly well. Whether they could actually bring to bear their armor, their infantry, their artillery and air power in a concerted way to destroy larger Ukrainian formations is yet to be seen.”Russian troops have been fighting in groups of a few hundred soldiers, rather than in the bigger and more effective formations of thousands of soldiers used in the past. “We haven’t seen any indication that they have the ability to adapt,” said Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired C.I.A. officer.The number of Russian losses in the war so far remains unknown, though Western intelligence agencies estimate 7,000 to 10,000 killed and 20,000 to 30,000 wounded. Thousands more have been captured or are missing in action.The Russian military, the Western and European officials said, has learned at least one major lesson from its failures: the need to concentrate forces, rather than spread them out.But Moscow is trying to find additional forces, according to intelligence officials.Russia’s best forces, its two airborne divisions and the First Guards Tank army, have suffered significant casualties and an erosion of combat power, and the military has scoured its army looking for reinforcements.The British Defense Ministry and the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank that analyzes the Ukraine war, both reported on Tuesday that the Russian troops withdrawing from Kyiv and Chernihiv would not be fit for redeployment soon.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a high-stakes visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on five railway stations across Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a trip by train to the Ukrainian capital. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.“The Russians have no ability to rebuild their destroyed vehicles and weapon systems because of foreign components, which they can no longer get,” said Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe who has been involved with Ukrainian defense matters since 2016.Russian forces arriving from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two secessionist statelets that broke away from Georgia during the 1990s and then expanded in 2008, have been conducting peacekeeping duties and are not combat ready, General Repass said.Russia’s problems finding additional troops are in large measure why it has invited Syrian fighters, Chechens and Russian mercenaries to serve as reinforcements. But these additional forces number in the hundreds, not thousands, European intelligence officials said.The Chechen force, one of the European intelligence officials said, is “clearly used to sow fear.” The Chechen units are not better fighters and have suffered high losses. But they have been used in urban combat situations and for “the dirtiest kind of work,” the official said.Russian mercenaries with combat experience in Syria and Libya are gearing up to assume an increasingly active role in a phase of the war that Moscow now says is its top priority: fighting in the country’s east.The number of mercenaries deployed to Ukraine from the Wagner Group, a private military force with ties to Mr. Putin, is expected to more than triple to at least 1,000 from the early days of the invasion, a senior American official said.Wagner is also relocating artillery, air defenses and radar that it had used in Libya to Ukraine, the official said.Moving mercenaries will “backfire because these are units that can’t be incorporated into the regular army, and we know that they are brutal violators of human rights which will only turn Ukrainian and world opinion further against Russia,” said Evelyn N. Farkas, the top Pentagon official for Russia and Ukraine during the Obama administration.Hundreds of Syrian fighters could also be heading to Ukraine, in what would effectively return a favor to Moscow for its helping President Bashar al-Assad crush rebels in an 11-year civil war.A contingent of at least 300 Syrian soldiers has already arrived in Russia for regular training, but it was unclear if or when they would be sent to Ukraine, officials said.“They are bringing in fighters known for brutality in the hopes of breaking the Ukrainian will to fight,” said Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. But, she added, any military gains there for Russia will depend on the willingness of the foreign fighters to fight.ImageStiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance has left much of Russia’s original force of more than 150,000 troops spent, military and intelligence officials say.Credit...Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times“One of the difficult things about putting together a coalition of disparate interests is that it can be hard to make them an effective fighting force,” she said.Finally, Mr. Putin recently signed a decree calling up 134,000 conscripts. It will take months to train the recruits, though Moscow could opt to rush them straight to the front lines with little or no instruction, officials said.“Russia is short on troops and is looking to get manpower where they can,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va. “They are not well placed for a prolonged war against Ukraine.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/russia-military-ukraine-war.html
314,"When The Interpreter first launched, our editors used to joke that the purpose of this column was to offer ‘smart answers to dumb questions.’That never became an official tagline. But I actually still stand by the basic concept: Often, the best way to decide what to write about is to look for questions that seem kind of obvious, but whose widely accepted answers don’t tell the whole story.It can feel a little silly to ask those questions — after all, it seems like there’s already an obvious answer! — but it often turns out that if I look a little deeper, something interesting and informative can be found lurking beyond the conventional wisdom.That’s the approach that led to this week’s column, which began with a question from a Times editor: Why is Poland willing to be so extraordinarily generous to Ukrainian refugees, who are arriving in huge numbers and putting a significant strain on the country’s resources, even though Poland’s right-wing government has been extremely hostile to far smaller groups of refugees in the past?The obvious answer, of course, is that it’s about race and religion. And that answer is not wrong: Identity does matter here. Past refugee arrivals have tended to be Middle Eastern Muslims, and Poland’s right-wing politicians have spent years whipping up hostility against them by claiming that Muslim immigrants would threaten Polish identity and culture. Ukrainians, who tend to be white and Christian, don’t fit the profile that those politicians have taught the public to fear.But prejudice and racial identity aren’t the whole story here. And focusing on them alone risks obscuring an even more powerful force at play — one with implications for other refugee crises around the world.ImageBanners showing support for Ukraine in downtown Warsaw, Poland’s capital, after the Russian invasion last month. Credit...Maciek Nabrdalik for The New York Times“The perceived threat is shared”The more significant factor in Poland’s welcoming attitude toward refugees, experts say, is that helping them feels like helping Ukraine’s struggle against Putin. And for many in Poland, that feels like self-defense.“The decisive factor, I think, is perception of a common threat that is coming from Russia,” said Olena Yermakova, a Ph.D. student at Jagiellonian University in Poland who is a researcher with the Fatigue Project on Eastern and Central European politics. “I have Polish friends saying that they feel if not for NATO, if not for us being lucky with Yeltsin and Walesa in the 90s, this would have been us. And it might still be us. So the perceived threat is shared, which is, I think, why people feel so strongly about it, and why there is so much solidarity that’s going on.”“Everything is defined by stories and familiar frames that people can relate to,” she said. “And the narrative now about Ukrainians is that they are freedom fighters against Russia, which is very much a category that Poles can relate to.”A similar pattern is playing out across Europe, said Lamis Abdelaaty, a political scientist at Syracuse University who studies political responses to refugees. “Various European countries have provided military assistance to Ukraine, but they’ve also drawn the line at sending troops or imposing a no-fly zone,” she said. “Given this set of limitations, welcoming Ukrainian refugees allows European countries to really signal which side of the conflict that they’re on.”And hosting refugees can actually have an effect on the conflict they are fleeing. “Members of the diaspora can support the fight back home, by sending money or sending supplies,” she said. “And welcoming refugees can basically signal that individuals are voting with their feet. It can discredit the government that’s forcing them to flee.”ImageRefugees from Ukraine arriving at a shelter in Budapest, Hungary.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesPolitical support can shift, thoughBut history suggests that this kind of support can be fragile and temporary. If Ukrainians’ period of need exceeds their period of foreign-policy relevance, they may be left vulnerable.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 23, 2022, 10:00 p.m. ETBombs in Kharkiv and a kiss reassurance in Kyiv.Artillery strikes hit Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, a scene of fighting since the earliest days of the war.As Western arms pour into Ukraine, Zelensky promises a victory.“If these countries wind up hosting large numbers of Ukrainian refugees for a lengthy period of time, we don’t know whether their welcome could cool,” Dr. Abdelaaty said.“We’ve certainly seen a similar dynamic in Turkey with Syrian refugees, where Turkey was initially very welcoming of Syrians, and then gradually realized that they were going to be there for the long haul and tempered its response,” she said.A similar pattern played out in the United States around Cuban refugees, said Stephanie R. Schwartz, a political scientist at the University of Southern California who studies forced migration.“During heightened anti-Communist eras of the Cold War, we see the U.S. was really welcoming to Cuban refugees because these were people coming from a ‘rival’ government, and we wanted to frame Castro and his regime as being horrible,” she said. “But by the time that Clinton is in office, that specter is falling away, and the Berlin Wall has fallen. The U.S. changes our tune on Cuba as well, and becomes much less welcoming.”That may become a problem for Ukrainians in the future. But it is already a problem for refugees fleeing other countries whose persecution feels less politically relevant. They are met with a far less welcoming response in Poland and other European countries than Ukrainians are — even though many may actually have stronger claims to protection under international refugee law.The question for the long term, then, is which response will become the standard: the welcome and support that has greeted Ukrainians, or the hostility toward refugees from elsewhere.“The very welcoming response to Ukrainians is wonderful to observe,” Dr. Abdelaaty said. “My hope is that this sort of response will be carried over to other refugee groups who are fleeing very similar situations and who are equally worthy of our compassion and our assistance.”“Hopefully, this moment will really lead people to critically reflect on why it is that they think some people are worthy of protection, and others are not.”How am I doing?I’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

315,"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called on ordinary people of his country and Russia alike to refuse to cooperate in Moscow’s invasion and occupation, and accused Russian forces in northern Ukraine of planting mines as they retreat, making it dangerous for people to return.The Russians have even booby-trapped dead bodies with explosives, he charged in his nightly video address, posted early Saturday morning in Ukraine — Friday night in the United States.Even as Russian forces pull back from Kyiv, the capital, and the city of Chernihiv farther north, “in the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult,” he said. “The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense.”Mr. Zelensky’s video messages have galvanized support among Ukraine’s allies, but his new address had an ominous tone, threatening his own people with unspecified consequences for cooperating with the invading Russians.“The responsibility for collaboration is inevitable,” he said.He noted that the Russians have appointed people to take over local governments and enterprises in areas they occupied — pointedly calling them “gauleiters,” a term for a regional administrator in Nazi Germany.“There will be problems for cooperation with them or with the occupiers directly. This is the last warning,” Mr. Zelensky said.He also asked Russians to resist conscription into the Kremlin’s military, which he said would result in “guaranteed death for many very young guys.”“Warn each such conscript, their parents,” he said. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so that they do not become villains. Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home. At their home. The Russians won’t be told the whole truth about this conscription and about the fate of the conscripts. But still, if you can convey the truth to them — do it.”In northern Ukraine, where Russian forces have been pulling back from positions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, “they are mining all this territory,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers.”His claims about mining could not be independently verified.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/world/europe/zelensky-russian-military-speech-video.html

317,"LVIV, Ukraine — After Russian forces surrounded the city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, cutting off its water and fuel and preventing aid convoys from entering, Yulia Beley sheltered in a neighbor’s basement with her three daughters and struggled to survive.Her husband was off defending the city, so she ventured out as bombs rained down to fetch water from a distant well and tried to comfort her children while the shelling shook the walls and ceiling. In time, the family’s food dwindled and Ms. Beley, a baker, said she fed her hungry children one bowl of porridge a day to share between them. Her 6-year-old daughter, Ivanka, dreamed of the poppy seed sweet rolls her mother had made before the war.“It tears you apart,” said Ms. Beley, 33, still traumatized after her escape from the city a week ago. “I just sobbed, just cried, screaming into the pillow when no one could see.”Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, it laid siege to Mariupol, using the ancient warfare tactic to try to starve the once-bustling city of 430,000 people into surrender.ImageWomen pushing mostly empty shopping carts near a damaged block of apartments in Mariupol on March 17. Residents have struggled to find food and water since Russian troops laid siege to the city.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersFrom the days when armies surrounded medieval castles in Europe to the battle of Stalingrad in World War II and the squeeze put on rebel communities in Syria during the 11-year civil war, militaries have used sieges throughout history regardless of the catastrophic effects on civilians caught in the middle.This month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused Russia of “starving” cities in Ukraine. He invoked the memory of the brother of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Viktor, who died in infancy during the German siege of Leningrad during World War II.“It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said. “The world is saying to Russia: ‘Stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine.’”Scholars of siege warfare say the tactic serves different purposes: to weaken enemies while avoiding clashes that can kill the besieging force’s own soldiers, or to freeze active fronts while attacking forces reposition. But the grueling nature of sieges — and how they use hunger to turn people’s own bodies against them — gives them a psychological power unique among war tactics, according to scholars and siege survivors.“Siege is a way to break the will and humiliate — and finally to control,” said Mouna Khaity, a health and gender researcher who lived through the Syrian government’s five-year siege of Eastern Ghouta, an area near Damascus.ImageSyrians displaced from Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, waiting to receive food at a shelter in Horjelli, Syria, in 2018.Credit...Hassan Ammar/Associated PressDepriving a residential area of food while bombarding it serves not only to flush out combatants, she said, but to communicate to everyone trapped inside: “You are not an equal human to me. You don’t deserve to eat, drink, have medicine or even breathe!”After they surrounded Mariupol last month, Russian forces cut off the city from everything it needed to live, the mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said on Ukrainian national television. They also destroyed the city’s power plants, cutting off electricity for residents as temperatures froze, Mr. Boichenko said, and then the water and gas, essential for cooking and heating.Some civilians managed to flee, making harrowing journeys through destroyed streets and Russian checkpoints. But about 160,000 people are believed to still be trapped inside the city, Mr. Boichenko said, and more than two dozen buses sent days ago to evacuate them had not been able to enter the city because of Russian shelling.On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ceasing relief operations in Mariupol because the warring parties could not guarantee the safety of aid workers.ImageResidents lined up for hot food in an improvised bomb shelter in Mariupol on March 7.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressAlmost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed there, the mayor estimated, but the figures could not be confirmed because of the difficulty of getting information.Russian forces are in control of parts of Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told a group of independent Russian journalists on Sunday. But the center of the city continues to hold, according to Ukrainian and British military assessments.An aide to the mayor, Pyotr Andryuschenko, told The New York Times that an estimated 3,000 Ukrainian fighters from the Azov Battalion were defending the city against about 14,000 Moscow-backed soldiers.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 8:46 p.m. ETRoughly 15,000 Russian troops have died since the start of the war, the U.K. estimates.Biden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.When the siege began, one Mariupol resident, Kristina, said she, her husband and two children camped out in the entryway of their building, hoping it would provide better shelter and protection than their apartment.Her husband, a business analyst, ventured out to find water and she cooked on an open fire. They also collected rainwater and snow, boiling the water to sterilize it.ImageAn armored convoy of pro-Russian troops filled a road leading to Mariupol on Monday.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersShe read fairy tales to try to distract the children, but once they got hungry, “the fire was gone from their eyes,” said Kristina, who did not want to use her full name for fear of retribution. “They had no interest in anything.”“We ate once a day,” she said. “It was mostly in the morning or in the evening that the children cried out, saying, ‘I want to eat.’”Her family finally fled the city, but left behind her father and grandparents. She has struggled to keep tabs on them because the city’s phone networks are mostly out.Last week, she said, they sent a text that read: “No roof, no food and no water.”Doctors who study hunger and starvation describe a grim process of the body mining itself to stay alive. First, it burns glucose stored in the liver, then fat, then muscle.ImageResidents passed by a fallen electricity pylon and a destroyed apartment building in Mariupol on March 25.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersWhile dehydration can kill in less than a week, a well-nourished adult can survive for more than 70 days on water alone. Children, the elderly and the ill succumb more quickly.Other research has shown that starvation not only weakens the body but disturbs the mind.Nancy Zucker, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, said research done during World War II on 36 male conscientious objectors who ate a low calorie diet modeled on that given to prisoners of war showed they had suffered “significant psychological consequences.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.She added: “They had starvation neuroses — increased anxiety, increased isolation, increased depression.”That damage compounds in traumatic circumstances, like wars.“This is starvation during a catastrophe,” she said. “It is very hard to separate the profound psychological consequences from being in a state of war from those of not having enough food.”ImageResidents gathered water at a well on the outskirts of Mariupol on March 9.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressThe memory of hunger haunted the conscientious objectors in the study long after they had regained their strength.“They needed to be surrounded by food,” and some remained obsessed with it, she said. “Several went on to become chefs.”Irina Peredey, a municipal worker from Mariupol, said that after she escaped, she was in such shock that she could not eat for days.After that, she began to crave a full meal about every hour.“An hour passes and you want to eat,” said Ms. Peredey, 29. “It seems to me psychological. You constantly start eating — and want to eat as much as possible.”At first she was confused, she said.“But now I see that apparently, this is how my body is fighting back.”ImageAn apartment building hit by shelling in Mariupol, on March 7.Credit...Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated PressAs Ms. Beley, the baker, fought to survive in the basement in Mariupol, she said, bombs shook the building and shells were so common that even her daughter Aida, 3, learned to distinguish between incoming and outgoing fire.The family soon ran out of food. Another woman gave her a jar of honey.“That’s how we survived,” she said. “We didn’t have food, but we can’t say we didn’t eat because a spoonful of honey once a day is already some kind of lunch.”When her family finally managed to escape, she felt weak, like her body was struggling to function. Russian soldiers offered candy to her and her children and at first, she refused. Then she changed her mind.“Give me candy, sugar,” she said. “I realized that I needed something so that I could maintain myself.”ImageMs. Beley’s daughter Diana, 11, on a phone with her friends Kira and Liza at the shelter in Lviv.

Her husband, Pavlo Vereteska, a fellow professional runner, remains in Ukraine and is fighting in the war, she said. Her parents and siblings are still there, too.Her home in Mykolaiv has been destroyed, she said, and the war had made her depressed and she was unable to train.But she longed to get back to the sport she loves, so she got in touch with officials from the Jerusalem Marathon and was able to get a spot in the event less than two weeks in advance.She was shocked by her victory, Ms. Vereteska said in an interview, especially because she was only recently able to resume training — in clothing and shoes collected by her Polish host family.This was the fourth marathon she had run. Before the war, she had placed first in a marathon in Albania on Oct. 17, and she came in third in the Gutenberg Marathon in Mainz, Germany, in May 2019, according to the World Athletics website.She said she thought about the war throughout the Jerusalem race, and those thoughts fueled her victory.“I’m stressed, of course I’m nervous about everything that’s happened in Ukraine, but it helped me,” she said of thinking of her home country, adding, “It was a very difficult race, it was very hilly, really very hilly.”The relatively slow winning times reflected the challenging course, which features a handful of steep climbs. Friday’s conditions did not help matters: it was windy and chilly with occasional rain. Ageze Guadie won the men’s race in 2 hours, 37 minutes and 17 seconds.Ms. Vereteska said her win made her smile for the first time since the war started. “This victory is for peace, for peace, in my country, and not only in my country — for peace in all the world.”She is unsure of what’s next.

The spaceport has been plagued by construction delays and remains unfinished.“We are not going to isolate ourselves,” Putin added, speaking alongside President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, an ally. “It is generally impossible to isolate anyone in the modern world, and most certainly not as huge a country as Russia.”Russia is now focused on the battle for the eastern Donbas region as the next stage of the war. Satellite images have shown a large column of Russian military vehicles headed toward Izium, a city in the east that is expected to be the staging ground for the new offensive.“I said it from the very beginning,” Putin said. “The main goal is to help people in the Donbas.”ImageAn armored vehicle near the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol today.Credit...Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersUkraine alleges a chemical attackThe U.S., Britain and other allies of Ukraine are examining claims that Russia deployed a chemical agent that sickened a handful of people in Mariupol, the southern city that has been under unrelenting attack.Ukrainian military commanders in the city said that Russian forces had used a drone on Monday to deploy “a poisonous substance of unknown origin” on the city’s sprawling Azovstal steel plant.

320,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainians on Monday reported that they had pushed back invading Russian forces in fierce fighting around Kyiv and in northeastern Ukraine, while the Russians moved to encircle and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east, making a diplomatic resolution to the war seem as far away as ever.Ukrainian counterattacks around Kyiv reportedly retook more ground, with the mayor of Irpin, a fiercely contested suburb on the northwestern edge of the capital, saying that most Russian troops had retreated, though fighting continued in some districts. If Ukrainian soldiers can maintain control of Irpin, it would be strategically important to keeping their hold on Kyiv.“Our Irpin is liberated from Moscow’s evil,” Mayor Oleksandr Markushin of Irpin posted on Telegram on Monday. But the deputy police chief, Oleksandr Bogai, offered a more skeptical account in a telephone interview, noting that fighting continued even as most Russian troops appeared to have pulled back, and that the Russians continued to shell the town.Diplomacy between the warring countries continued, with Russian and Ukrainian delegations arriving in Istanbul for another round of talks set to begin on Tuesday.While Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has said that he is open to discussing the future neutrality of Ukraine, if he can get security guarantees for his country and only after a national referendum, he has refused to concede territory to Russia or to the self-declared republics in the southeastern region known as the Donbas, as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has demanded.ImageA photograph released by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Sunday showing destroyed Russian tanks in Trostyanets, a town in the Sumy region.Credit...General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn Washington, President Biden on Monday stood by comments he made Saturday about Mr. Putin, “for God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” Speaking to reporters, Mr. Biden said the remark, apparently ad-libbed in a speech he delivered in Warsaw, was an expression of his personal outrage, not a statement of a U.S. policy that the Russian leader should be toppled.On the battlefield, in addition to gains around Kyiv, the Ukrainians also reported important progress in the Sumy region, northwest of Kharkiv, near the border with Russia. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, head of regional military administration, said that the Ukrainians had recaptured the towns of Trostyanets and Boromlya. A Pentagon official confirmed the recapture of Trostyanets.The Russian army is trying to cut off the major Ukrainian forces to the east of the River Dnipro, where the bulk of the army has been fighting Russian troops and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, which Moscow has recognized as the independent Donetsk and Luhansk republics. The Russian aim is to keep the Ukrainian troops from coming to the aid of Kyiv, and Russian military officials said over the weekend that their war effort was now concentrated in the east of the country.Despite those comments, Russian forces continued to battle for control of key towns east and northwest of Kyiv.ImagePeople who had fled their homes in various parts of Ukraine waited at Kyiv central station before continuing their journey.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesRussian forces have seized a southern corridor between Crimea, which they captured from Ukraine in 2014, and the Donbas, interrupted only by the besieged port city of Mariupol, which they have devastated with artillery, rockets and airstrikes, and appear determined to capture.“Russian forces appear to be concentrating their effort to attempt the encirclement of Ukrainian forces directly facing the separatist regions in the east of the country, advancing from the direction of Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south,” the British Ministry of Defense said in a statement.A spokesman for Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said on Monday that almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed there. Those figures could not be confirmed. The mayor’s office also said that 90 percent of the buildings had been damaged and 40 percent destroyed, and that some 170,000 people still remain in the city — again, figures that cannot be confirmed.“The situation in the city remains difficult,” Mr. Boichenko, who is no longer in the city, said on national television on Monday. “People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.”In weeks of talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, there have been no clear diplomatic steps toward bringing the war to an end. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that while the decision to keep talking in person was important, “We cannot yet talk about progress and we will not.”ImageOleg, 61, who would only let his first name be used, recuperating on Monday in a hospital in Kyiv after being shot in the leg three times by Russian forces in Irpin.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesIn an interview on Sunday with independent Russian media — an interview censored in Russia itself — Mr. Zelensky restated his willingness to accede to at least some Russian demands.“Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state — we are ready to go for it,” he said.But it is not clear what neutrality would mean. Mr. Putin insists that Ukraine must never join NATO, a demand Mr. Zelensky appears to have accepted, but also that it demilitarize, a term that has not been defined. And it remains unclear if Mr. Putin would accept Ukraine joining the European Union, too.After all, Mr. Putin has responded with force in the past to Ukraine’s drawing closer to Europe. He pressured the last Kremlin-aligned Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, to renege on a promised trade deal with the European Union. After that sparked protests that forced out Mr. Yanukovych in 2014, Mr. Putin invaded Crimea and spurred the separatist war in Donbas.On Sunday, Mr. Zelensky again called for direct negotiations with Mr. Putin, but the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, repeated on Monday that such talks would have to wait for more progress in the peace talks — and presumably more progress in Russia’s war.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia meeting with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, in Moscow in February, weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Credit...Sputnik, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesReports emerged Monday that Ukrainian peace negotiators and a Russian billionaire attempting to act as a mediator might have been poisoned early this month, though the circumstances were very murky and those affected all recovered. The first reports, by The Wall Street Journal and the investigative group Bellingcat, indicated that at least two Ukrainian peace negotiators and the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has attempted to act as a go-between, developed unusual symptoms at the same time in early March after meeting in Kyiv — red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened. The United States toughened its messaging on the Ukraine war, saying the American aim was not just to thwart the Russian invasion but also to weaken Russia so it could no longer carry out such military aggression anywhere.On the ground. ​​Russia renewed its attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure, striking five railroad stations with missiles just hours after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken made a risky and secretive visit by train to Kyiv.Fears of a new front. Explosions shook Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova aligned with Russia that occupies a strategically important spot on Ukraine’s western flank. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of causing the explosions as a pretext to invade Ukraine from that direction.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.The description of the symptoms was confirmed to The Times by someone close to Mr. Abramovich.Asked about the reports, members of the Ukrainian negotiating team did not address them directly. “There is a lot of speculation, various conspiracy theories,” said one, Mykhailo Podolyak. Another, Rustem Umerov, referred to “unverified information.”Reuters reported that an unnamed U.S. official “with knowledge” of the matter said that the sickness may have been caused by “an environmental factor.”ImageThe Russian newspaper editor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitri A. Muratov at the memorial office of the slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Moscow last year.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesWithin Russia, censorship of the Zelensky interview was just another indication of the repression of information — the government has essentially made it a criminal offense to criticize the war — or even call it a war. On Monday, Novaya Gazeta, the Russian newspaper that helped define fearless journalism in the post-Soviet era and whose editor, Dmitri A. Muratov, shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, suspended publication in print and online at least until the end of war, leaving Russia without a major media outlet critical of the Kremlin.President Biden has not withheld his own contempt for Mr. Putin and this war. Mr. Peskov on Monday said that Mr. Biden’s comments in Warsaw about Mr. Putin not remaining in power “are concerning, of course.” He added that “we will continue following the U.S. president’s statements very carefully, we are scrupulously documenting them and we will keep doing this.”Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, who is seeking re-election next month, warned on Sunday against escalation of words or actions, in an implicit critique of Mr. Biden. Mr. Macron, who has had several conversations with Mr. Putin, said he hoped to achieve “first a cease-fire and then the total withdrawal of troops by diplomatic means.” He added, “If we want to do that, we can’t escalate either in words or actions.”Mr. Zelensky has consistently demanded more action from NATO and Western countries — to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, to supply combat aircraft, to accelerate the flow of advanced weaponry, including armed drones, ground-to-air missiles and anti-tank weaponry, not to mention many thousands of rounds of ammunition. Washington and its allies have ruled out a no-fly zone; they have not refused to provide aircraft, but so far they have not delivered any.ImagePeople who had fled their homes in various parts of Ukraine at Kyiv central station on Monday.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesIn an interview with the Economist in Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky said he was committed to victory and asked for more aid.“We believe in victory,” he said. “It’s impossible to believe in anything else.” But to achieve it, he said, Ukraine needs tanks, armored personnel vehicles and military aircraft, and it needs them now.The West can just promise to help in coming weeks, he said. “It doesn’t allow us to unblock Russia-occupied cities, to bring food to residents there, to take the military initiative into our own hands.” And Russia keeps pushing ahead, he said. “The Russians have thousands of military vehicles, and they are coming and coming and coming.”Andrew E.

321,"TIJUANA, Mexico — More than 2,000 Ukrainians have made their way to the U.S. border from Mexico over the past 10 days, joining desperate migrants from around the world in what officials expect could become a major border surge as pandemic restrictions are lifted and the continuing fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reaches America’s shores.The sudden arrivals in Tijuana present an immediate challenge to U.S. border officials, who are already bracing for a flood of unauthorized migration from countries such as Honduras and Haiti when the United States eases its emergency Covid-19 border rules next month. Now, the United States must also find a way to accommodate thousands of people fleeing a murderous Russian invasion halfway around the world.“I’m troubled. I’m tired. We have been here more than two days,” said Nataly Yankova, 48, who fled Ukraine with two adolescent daughters, one in a wheelchair, and two nephews and planned to join her brother who is living in Chicago.They were among 15 Ukrainian families sitting in folding chairs on a chilly spring night this week, beside a coiled-wire fence that separates Mexico from the United States. It had taken most of them three days to reach the front of the line from which U.S. officials were calling in Ukrainians for entry interviews.The surge of Ukrainian refugees into Mexico has gained momentum as U.S. embassies and consulates in Europe have struggled to process a barrage of visa and refugee applications.ImageUkrainian families sit in folding chairs beside a coiled-wire fence that separates Mexico from the United States.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageBy Sunday, the number of Ukrainians in Tijuana had soared to close to 1,200, about 400 of them sleeping in a gym.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageThe sudden arrivals in Tijuana present an immediate challenge to U.S. border officials, who are already bracing for a flood of unauthorized migration from countries such as Honduras and Haiti.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesOnly a week ago, just 50 Ukrainian refugees who had flown to Mexico were in the teeming border city of Tijuana, crammed in a small, tunnel-like bus stop until they could enter the United States. Within four days, the backup had ballooned to 500, and a makeshift encampment had sprung up on a patch of grass. By Sunday, as plane after plane disgorged bedraggled war refugees in Tijuana, the number had soared to close to 1,200, about 400 of them sleeping in a gym.After making harrowing escapes from their homeland and long plane trips to reach Mexico, they soon realized that passage to America was not automatic. A backlog began to build, and confusion reigned.To avert a humanitarian crisis, dozens of Russian-speaking volunteers, religious organizations and private groups rushed in to organize food, shelter and medical and logistical support on both sides of the border.“There is only so much we can do — and we have done a lot working 24/7,” said Olya Krasnykh, who took time off from her real estate development job in San Mateo, Calif., to organize a response team of about 30 people.“The system at the border is incredibly inefficient,” said Ms. Krasnykh, walkie-talkie in hand. “I don’t know how long we can sustain the volunteer-run effort.”The Biden administration announced last month that the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainians. But it has not unveiled any details, prompting those with family and friends in the United States to pay thousands of dollars to reach Mexico, a country that, unlike the United States, they can enter without a visa.“They made an announcement and had no program in place,” Ms. Krasnykh said.ImageDozens of Russian-speaking volunteers, religious organizations and private groups rushed in to organize food, shelter and medical and logistical support.

Already, economic hardship has been driving Cubans to the United States in numbers not seen in nearly three decades. Border agents encountered more than 50,000 Nicaraguans in 2021, up from 2,291 in 2020, amid a crackdown on dissent by President Daniel Ortega.Chris Magnus, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said in a statement early this week that the agency was bolstering resources and personnel at the border.“President Biden’s decision to welcome Ukrainian refugees seeking safety in the United States is the right thing to do,” said Blaine Bookey, legal director at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at University of California, Hastings. But she said there were questions about Ukrainian migrants getting priority over those from Central America and elsewhere.“There is no way to look at what’s happening at the southern border other than along racial lines,” she said.Five Central American migrants, including a young Guatemalan couple with a 3-year-old boy, showed up this week at the edge of the encampment where the Ukrainians were waiting.They had just made it to Tijuana after clinging to the Bestia, the notoriously dangerous train that traverses Mexico, and were hoping to rest on a spit of grass near a tent. Could they, one of them asked. Their goal was to cross the border.ImageA group of Guatemalan migrants in front of the Ukrainian tent encampment.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageOn many days, only about 200 refugees have been processed into the country by U.S. border authorities, half as many as arrived on flights.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesImageUkrianians joined migrants from around the world in what officials expect could become a major border surge.“It was on the news that the United States is offering asylum,” said Marvin Francisco, 29, from Honduras, who had heard about the impending end of Title 42. “My country is infested with gangsters.”The Hondurans were allowed to sit on the grass, but they were offered none of the pastries, juice and coffee being handed out around the clock to the Ukrainians.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 7:28 p.m. ETBiden announces his pick for ambassador to Ukraine after months of delay.Behind Austin’s call for a ‘weakened’ Russia are hints of a shift.Emboldened by Ukraine’s grit, the U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.Tijuana recently opened to Ukrainian refugees a sports complex, Benito Juárez, that in 2018 had been used to house thousands of Central American migrants who had arrived in a caravan with hopes of gaining access to the United States.Ms. Krasnykh and her team negotiated shelter at the facility with officials from the state of Baja California, who within hours provided mats, Wi-Fi and security.

322,"BEZRUKY, Ukraine — When Sergiy, a 47-year-old construction worker, got out of bed Sunday morning in this small town in northeastern Ukraine, he discovered a chilling new hazard in a war filled with them: He had woken up in a minefield.He had heard a rocket land near his home around 1 in the morning but thought little of it. There had been plenty of rockets since Russian forces invaded in late February. The thuds, crumps and blasts had become a cruel but familiar soundtrack to those who stayed behind, along with the acidic smell the weapons left in the air.But what landed in his yard was a new weapon for the town’s residents to add to their growing lexicon of destruction: they knew the Smerch, the Grad, the Hurricane — and now they were introduced to the PTM-1S land mine, a type of scatterable munition.“Nobody understood what it was,” said Sergiy, declining to provide his surname out of fear of retribution. The weapons roar in like any rocket, but instead of exploding instantly, they eject up to two dozen mines that explode at intervals, parceling out death in the hours afterward.Since the start of the invasion, Russia has made clear that it is willing to mete out violence and destruction to achieve its aims, often indiscriminately. It has launched cruise missiles, sent in tanks and fired mortars, artillery and rockets. Now it has also turned to something less ominous in appearance, but just as brutal.These scatterable mines, banned under some interpretations of international law and never officially recorded during this war, have appeared only sparingly in Bezruky and elsewhere in the periphery of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The weapons add yet another element of peril for civilians trying to navigate parts of the ruined landscape.The mines are green tubes about the size of a liter of soda, packed with three pounds of explosives. They are often used to disable tanks but had, in Sergiy’s case, landed where his 8-year-old daughter likes to play when the weather is pleasant.ImageA local resident took a photo of a PTM-1S land mine that landed in Bezruky. The mines are triggered by timers.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“These weapons combine the worst possible attributes of cluster munitions and land mines,” said Brian Castner, a senior arms researcher for Amnesty International. “Any one of these indiscriminate attacks is unlawful, and they’re happening on top of each other.”Scatterable land mines can include those meant to kill people and those designed to destroy tanks. The United States last used them during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and they have since largely been banned by a 1997 international treaty signed by 164 nations, including Ukraine, that targeted anti-personnel mines.Some anti-vehicle mines — like the PTM-1S that landed in Sergiy’s yard — have sensitive fuses that can cause them to explode when people pick them up, and can be considered anti-personnel mines. They are thus banned under international law, though neither Russia nor the United States has joined the relevant treaty.The morning of April 3 began like any other in Bezruky since the Russian invasion began: another day without power for the several thousand residents, and the sporadic shelling between Ukrainian and Russian forces that had become commonplace.It was mostly quiet, but at around 10 a.m., Sergiy’s backyard shed exploded. There was no sound of an incoming artillery shell or rocket, just the blast.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 12:06 p.m. ETIn India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.For years, the U.S. sent mixed signals about its interests in Ukraine. Then Putin made his move.Fires rip through Russian oil depots not far from the Ukrainian border.Sergiy, who had lived in Bezruky for much of his life, went out to inspect the damage. Debris had scattered all over his workbench, the side of the shed was damaged and a rectangular crater several inches deep had appeared.He went out to board up the windows of his house, fearing there might be another explosion, when he spotted a green tube, another PTM-1S mine, next to the fence in his neighbor’s backyard. He quickly snapped a picture and went back inside.It exploded 20 minutes later, he said.“The bursts continued throughout the day with intervals around 50 minutes, and the last one was around 3 o’clock the next night after it first landed,” Sergiy said. There is no Ukrainian military equipment in Bezruky. The Russian front lines are roughly seven miles to the north, and to the south are Ukrainian artillery positions.ImageBomb disposal technicians removing an undetonated rocket loaded with cluster munitions from a field in the village of Ridnyi Krai, Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe mines were set to self-destruct at specific times, a feature baked into each mine, which can be set at two-hour intervals for up to 24 hours. Nobody was killed or injured in the series of blasts that rocked his neighborhood.“It was lucky that kids didn’t play there that day,” Sergiy said. “Normally they would play in the backyard at the time of the first pieces detonating, but it was rainy that day.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J.

President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.Bomb disposal technicians in Kharkiv, who respond to calls for unexploded munitions across the city and its periphery, said this was the first recorded appearance of the PTM-1S since the war’s beginning.As Russia shifts its focus to the country’s east after its stinging defeats around the country’s capital, Russian forces have increased their shelling around Kharkiv and elsewhere in the region, often resorting to indiscriminate attacks to tie up resources. Intentionally targeting civilians with weapons of any kind is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions, and Russia’s use of these scatterable mines would likely constitute an indiscriminate attack, given that the artillery rockets carrying these mines, which can travel up to 20 miles, were fired at a civilian area devoid of military targets.ImageA bombing site in Bezruky, on the outskirts of Kharkiv.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“Last week this weapon appeared,” said the team leader of an explosives removal unit working in Kharkiv and the towns nearby. He provided only his first name, Maksym, for security reasons. There are at least six other teams like his deployed throughout the region.The randomly exploding mines are just a new feature of Maksym’s grueling job. His team of half-a-dozen men have been working nonstop in the Kharkiv region since Russia invaded. It will likely take years, and possibly decades, to clear all of the ordnance launched into Ukraine during the war.The 26-year-old team leader records five to 30 incidents a day, fields reports of rockets landing in homes on his phone and is often asked by passers-by to come look at explosive debris.On Tuesday, Maksym’s rounds included digging out a 122-millimeter rocket casing from in front of a supermarket and removing debris from an apartment building and an amusement park.Toward the end of the day, as he worked in a farmer’s field to extract the remains of a Smerch rocket, a man on a bicycle rode up and waved him down.“Can you go pull out the same thing from my place?” the man shouted.Thomas Gibbons-Neff reported from Bezruky, and John Ismay from Washington.

323,"BRUSSELS — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine lambasted the former leaders of Germany and France, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, in a video address released late on Sunday, seemingly blaming them for the deaths of Ukrainian civilians.“I invite Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions to Russia has led to,” Mr. Zelensky said, referring to the Kyiv suburb where images surfaced over the weekend of bodies lying in the streets after Russian forces withdrew. “See with your own eyes the tortured and slain Ukrainians.”Mr. Zelensky was speaking, he said, on the 14th anniversary of the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, where, after a major internal debate, NATO promised membership in the alliance to Georgia and Ukraine but without specifying when.He blamed NATO country politicians for harboring an “absurd fear” of Russia, adding: “They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they could appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally alongside us.”Later, he insisted that he did not blame the West or anyone else except the Russian soldiers who he said committed crimes against Ukrainians and those who gave them their orders. “But we have the right to talk about indecision,” he said.The Bucharest summit was marked by a debate over whether to give Ukraine and Georgia a formal “membership action plan” to guide them toward qualifying for NATO membership. President George W. Bush favored doing so. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy were not alone in arguing that neither country was ready, and that to extend membership plans to them would severely hurt relations with Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin.Mr. Bush’s defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, told him that offering Georgia and Ukraine NATO membership “was truly overreaching” and, according to his memoir, a case of “recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests.”Mr. Putin made the same point in Bucharest, saying that Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO were red lines for him.In a late-night compromise, all NATO member states agreed that the two countries should not be offered a membership action plan, but were promised membership at some point in the future.Fiona Hill, a Russia scholar who was then a U.S. government intelligence analyst, said that the intelligence community tried to persuade Mr. Bush not to make that promise, but failed. Four months later, Russia went to war in Georgia. As for Ukraine, Ms. Hill said, Mr. Putin “has been trying to shut that door ever since.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

But Germany and France — and NATO as a whole — have made it clear even during this war that they have no interest in fighting a nuclear-armed Russia on behalf of Ukraine.

325,"LVIV, Ukraine — Russian missiles struck Lviv on Monday, killing at least seven people in the first reported deaths of the war in the western city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have fled to escape the fierce fighting in other parts of Ukraine.The head of Lviv’s military administration, Maksym Koztyskyy, said three missiles hit empty military warehouses while a fourth hit a garage, killing and injuring civilians. He did not say whether all the casualties were from the garage strike, which hit a few hundred feet from a set of railway tracks. “If the garage was the ultimate target, maybe they were aiming at the railway station,” he said. “There are no longer any safe or unsafe locations.”The head of Ukraine’s railway service, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, said he had no proof that the attack was aimed at the railway, which has some facilities near military sites.For many in Lviv, the attacks opened a new page in the conflict: a realization that even hundreds of miles from the front lines, this city known as a tourist destination and the cultural capital of Ukraine could be attacked at any time.“We have to be vigilant because the enemy is getting more and more atrocious,” said Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. “You have to protect yourself,” he said, pleading with residents to go to bomb shelters when air raid sirens sounded.At one of the impact sites, gray smoke billowed from what remained of the red roof of a long, concrete garage with a sign reading “carwash” and “tire replacement.” The hole in the roof indicated that the building, which overlooks railway tracks in a ravine below, had suffered a direct hit from a missile. As another air raid siren sounded, firefighters tried to extinguish the flames while ambulances ferried away the wounded.A few streets away from the burning building, a resident hung her laundry out to dry while others walked small dogs wearing sweaters.As the garage burned, a train from the eastern city of Dnipro rumbled slowly by on its way to the nearby Lviv train station, carrying passengers fleeing the fighting in Dnipro and headed to the city of Truskavets in western Ukraine. It stopped briefly in Lviv and one of the conductors said he had tried to reassure the passengers as they started hearing about the airstrikes by phone.“People were getting information from their relatives in Lviv” about the attacks, said the conductor, Fedir, leaning out of the railway car to talk before it pulled away. “They weren’t panicked, but they were worried. I told them to stay calm,” he added, asking that he be identified by his first name only.Inside the train station, Anna Khrystiuk, a volunteer staffing an information desk for displaced people flooding into the train station, said most people had ignored the air raid siren until the first explosion.“We told people to go to the shelter but they didn’t listen to us,” said Ms. Khrystiuk, 23. But with the sound of the explosion, she said, passengers ran to the underground level of the station that serves as a shelter.“It was panic,” she said. “Many people came from Kharkiv and other places and they were so afraid of rockets already. They thought that it was safe to stay here.”. While they were underground, they heard three more explosions.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

His car windshield had a large hole from the impact of a piece of metal.He said he and other drivers slammed on the brakes and took cover near their cars when the missiles struck.“It happened too quickly for me to be afraid,” said Mr. Maznin, who joined the police force just six months ago.In addition to the seven killed, Mr. Kozytskyy said 11 people were injured, but that toll could rise as rescue workers cleared rubble from the impact site. At least two people were critically injured, and a child was among those with more minor injuries.Mr. Kozytskyy said the missiles were launched by aircraft coming from the direction of the Caspian Sea.The Lviv mayor said earlier on Monday that five missiles were fired.A month ago, Russian missiles struck a military base outside the city that was used extensively for training Ukrainian forces. And Russian missile attacks hit a fuel storage site and a tank repair facility in Lviv in late March.“The world knows that Lviv is the biggest hub for those fleeing from shelling and over 100 embassies moved to Lviv,” said Mr. Sadovyi, the mayor. “This is an attempt to intimidate.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/world/lviv-russia-strike-ukraine.html

Even to those who can’t hear them.”“Support us in any way you can,” he added. “Any, but not silence.”After Zelensky’s address, John Legend performed his song “Free,” featuring a Ukrainian singer, Mika Newton, and a poet, Lyuba Yakimchuk, who fled the country days ago.Here is Zelensky’s full speech:The war. What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people. Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars. Over 400 children have been injured and 153 children died. And we’ll never see them drawing. Our parents are happy to wake up in the morning in bomb shelters. But alive. Our loved ones don’t know if we will be together again. The war doesn’t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence. Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway. We defend our freedom to live, to love, to sound on our land. We are fighting Russia, which brings horrible silence with its bombs. The dead silence. Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today to tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks, on TV. Support us in any way you can. Any — but not silence. And then peace will come.

327,"WASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday stood by his comment that Vladimir V. Putin should not remain president of Russia, but he said it was an expression of his own horror over the invasion of Ukraine and not a change in American policy aimed at seeking to remove Mr. Putin from office.“I was expressing the moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House, rejecting criticism from around the globe in the last two days about the potential diplomatic consequences of his words. The president said no one should have interpreted his comments as calling for Mr. Putin’s ouster.“It’s ridiculous,” he said of the questions about his speech in Warsaw on Saturday, when he said, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” On Monday, Mr. Biden said: “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.”The fallout over Mr. Biden’s words in Warsaw underscored the dilemma that he and the NATO allies face about how to condemn the war in Ukraine and pressure Russia without shutting down any relationship with Moscow that might help end the invasion.The West will also have to decide whether Moscow would be allowed back into the global economy, whether to lift sanctions and how to resume diplomatic relations if Russia pulls back its forces.Mr. Biden’s remark drew some praise for its toughness and clarity but also warnings from lawmakers and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who said on Sunday that “I wouldn’t use this kind of words” when asked about Mr. Biden’s speech. Mr. Macron said he hoped to obtain a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through diplomacy.Some critics said Mr. Biden’s declaration could make it more difficult to negotiate an end to the 5-week-old war, which has killed thousands in Ukraine and driven millions from their homes.Mr. Biden insisted on Monday that was not the case, although Mr. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said that Mr. Biden’s statement “makes us worry” and that the Kremlin would “continue to closely monitor” the president’s remarks.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin has told Russians for years that he believes the United States and the C.I.A. are conspiring to remove him from power.Credit...Sputnik, via ReutersIn his speech in Warsaw, Mr. Biden tried to draw a distinction between Mr. Putin’s actions and those of the Russian people, who he said were not responsible for the atrocities being committed by the country’s military in Ukraine each day. He suggested that Russian controls on television and the internet had left the country’s citizens unaware of the truth.“Vladimir Putin’s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century,” he said. Moments later, he proclaimed that “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty” before declaring that Mr. Putin should go.The White House appeared to rapidly understand that Mr. Biden’s words could be seen as a reversal of the administration’s long-stated position that it was not seeking regime change in Russia. It took just minutes for officials to back away from Mr. Biden’s comments on Saturday evening. Reporters had just loaded buses after his speech when administration officials sent an email denying that the president was formally advocating Mr. Putin’s removal.On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told journalists in Jerusalem that “we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter.”On Monday, his first extended comments on the matter, Mr. Biden insisted his statement had been misinterpreted.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 25, 2022, 2:02 p.m. ETWorking on the railroad when the railroad is a target.Explosions hit Transnistria, a Russian-allied region of Moldova, amid fears of a new front in the war.In India, a top E.U. official warns of broader ramifications of Russian aggression.“The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war or a nuclear war with Russia. That’s not part of it,” Mr. Biden said. “I was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man. It’s outrageous. It’s outrageous. It’s more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn’t be in power.”“People like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do,” he said, adding, “But it doesn’t mean I can’t express my outrage.”Mr. Biden spoke as the violence in Ukraine continued to intensify, with Russian forces appearing determined to cement their territorial gains in the east. In just five weeks, the conflict has killed thousands of civilians, including women and children who have been the victims of intense Russian bombardment. Human rights advocates say more than 3.7 million Ukrainians have fled, creating one of the largest-ever refugee crises across Eastern Europe.The president’s remark on Saturday was not the first time an apparently off-the-cuff comment upended or overshadowed an otherwise tightly scripted White House message.During a news conference earlier on the trip, Mr. Biden said Russia’s use of chemical weapons “would trigger a response in kind,” seeming to suggest that NATO would respond with chemical weapons, which are banned by international law. Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, told reporters the next day that was not what the president meant, saying that the “United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period, under any circumstances.”In January, Mr. Biden created a similar flurry of speculation when he said that the response to a then-potential invasion of Ukraine would depend on whether “it’s a minor incursion.” Mr. Biden eventually corrected himself, saying, “If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.”ImageBefore his speech on Saturday, President Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesMr. Biden is no stranger to the nuances of public diplomacy, in which officials — especially heads of state — are careful to speak in very particular ways in an effort to avoid offending another leader or sending an unintended message about policy.American presidents, for example, never refer to Taiwan as an independent nation for fear of provoking anger from the Chinese government. Similar care is taken when talking about the city of Jerusalem, the status of which remains a disputed part of discussions between Israel and the Palestinians.In 2016, when President Barack Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former Israeli president, a White House stenographer initially indicated that the remarks had been given in “Jerusalem, Israel.” After that created a minor flap, the remarks were amended to remove the reference to Israel.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.President Donald J. Trump repeatedly violated many of the diplomatic rules in what aides said was a deliberate attempt to shake up the way foreign policy was conducted. He called the leader of North Korea “Rocket Man,” formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and took steps to more formally deal with Taiwan in the final days of his administration.Since taking office, Mr. Biden has made it a priority to return to a more traditional form of diplomacy in which the United States seeks to work with adversaries like Russia even as the administration challenges actions by Mr. Putin that it finds objectionable.But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tested that approach. During the past several weeks, Mr. Biden has grown increasingly vocal in his condemnation of Mr. Putin, using more aggressive language as the Russian leader has escalated his attacks on Ukraine.A week ago, he called Mr. Putin “a war criminal” before the United States had officially made that determination. Before his speech on Saturday, Mr. Biden visited with refugees from Ukraine at a stadium in Warsaw and called Mr. Putin “a butcher” because of the deaths caused by shelling in Mariupol, a hard-hit city in the eastern part of the country.That kind of language has helped Mr. Biden unite American allies behind a coordinated set of responses to Mr. Putin’s aggression, including some of the most severe sanctions ever levied on a large, developed nation. The president’s condemnations have been echoed over the past several weeks by other world leaders.But it remains a delicate balance as the administration tries not to provoke Mr. Putin into engaging in a broader conflict with NATO countries. Mr. Biden has said repeatedly that such engagements could lead to World War III.In his remarks to reporters on Monday, the president said it was his visit with the refugees just hours earlier that led to his comment about Mr. Putin not staying in power.“Half the children in Ukraine,” he said, apparently referring to the number of children who are estimated to have become refugees because of the war. “I had just come from being with those families.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/biden-putin.html

329,"In response to censorship by Moscow and provocative posts about the war in Ukraine, Twitter detailed new policies on Tuesday that it said would reduce amplification of Russian government accounts and ban some tweets containing images of prisoners of war.Twitter, like other companies, is updating its content moderation policies for war, and the changes escalate its existing policies for posts from state-affiliated media. They also show how the company is trying to walk a line between supporting important documentation of events in the conflict and exploitation.Twitter said it would stop amplifying government accounts from countries that “limit access to the open internet while they’re engaged in armed conflict,” Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity, said in a press call on Monday. In practice, the policy applies only to Russian government accounts, which will no longer be recommended on Twitter’s home timeline, explore page or search results.Russia has throttled access to Twitter, meaning that pages load slower for users in that country and in some cases don’t load at all. Mr. Roth said the policy would apply to any wartime country that placed restrictions on the internet, whether Twitter was blocked or not.“When we find a government that is engaged in armed conflict is blocking or limiting access to online services within their country while they themselves continue to use those same services to advance their position and viewpoint, that creates a harmful information imbalance,” he said.Twitter will stop amplifying state-run accounts rather than ban them, Mr. Roth said. Existing steps to stop amplifying state-affiliated media content — such as the government-funded Russia Today — have led to a 30 percent decline in the number of views of state media, he said.Twitter also said it would require the removal of any tweets posted by state or government accounts that included video or images of prisoners of war. Similar tweets by nonstate accounts will violate the policy if they are shared with “abusive intent,” including tweets that insult, mock or wish harm to the prisoners of war, Mr. Roth said.If an account posts a tweet that violates the policy, Twitter will require the violator to remove it before the account can tweet again. An exception are tweets that are important for “evidentiary purposes,” which will be determined case by case, Mr. Roth said. Those tweets will be given a warning label.Ukrainian government accounts have posted dozens of videos purportedly showing Russian prisoners of war. The videos, intended to highlight how Russian soldiers are young and poorly trained, showed them denouncing the war and being allowed to call their parents. But the videos raised questions about whether they violated the Geneva Convention, which restricts publishing images of war prisoners.The obligation to protect prisoners of war “from being objects of public curiosity, as well as protecting them from intimidation or humiliation, is part of the broader requirement to ensure their humane treatment and protect their families from harm,” said Aisling Reidy, a legal adviser to Human Rights Watch, in a statement that the international organization posted on March 16. “The Ukrainian authorities should stop posting these videos online.”Such videos would violate Twitter’s new policy, Mr. Roth said on Monday, but the policy will not be applied retroactively.“We don’t want Twitter to be used by state actors to infringe on international humanitarian law,” he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/business/twitter-policy-ukraine.html
330,"High-profile prisoners held by both Russia and Ukraine, including two British fighters believed captured in Mariupol, appealed on Monday to be exchanged.Viktor Medvedchuk, one of the richest tycoons in Ukraine and a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, appeared in a 34-second video posted on Twitter by the Security Service of Ukraine. Mr. Medvedchuk, 67, the leader of a Ukrainian political party, asked both Mr. Putin and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to exchange him for the people defending Mariupol as well as any civilians trapped in the besieged, shattered southern port city.Mr. Medvedchuk, who had been under house arrest on treason charges when the war started but escaped, had been shown after he was captured on April 12, handcuffed, in military fatigues and looking disheveled and dazed. In his appeal on Monday, his hair was combed and he was wearing a zippered sweater.Mr. Medvedchuk was considered particularly close to Mr. Putin, who was godfather to his youngest daughter.Two British fighters for Ukraine apparently captured in Mariupol appeared on Russian state television, asking to be released in exchange for Mr. Medvedchuk. All three men seemed to be speaking while in detention. The two Britons made the suggestion at the prompting of a man not identified on camera, who showed them a clip from a news conference that Mr. Medvedchuk’s wife, Oksana, gave over the weekend asking that he be freed. That prompted speculation that the Russians, who controlled the interview process, had come up with the exchange idea.It was unclear how free the Britons were to say what they wanted. The two — Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28 — spoke separately in interviews broadcast Monday on Rossiya 24, a state channel. Both men requested that the British government offer assistance toward an exchange for Mr. Medvedchuk. “I’d like to appeal to the government to send me back home; I’d like to see my wife again,” Mr. Pinner said, addressing Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly in saying that both men needed help.The two fought on the Ukrainian side in Mariupol, which Russian forces have almost captured entirely, other than the vast Azovstal steelworks complex. Both seemed in good health, if a bit battered and dirty, and Mr. Aslin had a gash in his forehead.

331,"The evidence of apparent atrocities in Ukraine, with civilians executed in the suburbs of Kyiv, brings to mind another European horror: the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s and the sometimes fraught, yearslong effort to bring those responsible to justice.In 1999, Slobodan Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia and the architect of a decade of war that took more than 200,000 lives and tore the country apart, became the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes. Three years later, he became the first former head of state to stand trial for genocide for the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as for crimes against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions for the wars in Croatia and Kosovo.Recalling the significance of the trial, Human Rights Watch, the advocacy group, observed in a 2006 report that bringing the former president before an international criminal tribunal “marked the end of the era when being a head of state meant immunity from prosecution.”Since then, it noted, other former heads of state, including the former Liberian prime minister Charles Taylor and the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, have been brought to justice.Mr. Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in prison for his role in atrocities committed during Sierra Leone’s civil war in the 1990s. Mr. Hussein was convicted in 2006 by an Iraqi special tribunal for crimes against humanity for the brutal repression of a Shiite town in the 1980s and sentenced to death by hanging.Mr. Milosevic died in his prison cell in The Hague in 2006, denying his victims the closure of a final judgment, but the public airing of his heinous crimes was nevertheless an important moral and legal reckoning.While the circumstances in Ukraine and the Balkan wars differ in fundamental ways, including the scope and scale of the bloodshed, some parallels jump out — not least of which is Russia’s obfuscation and denial. In the face of graphic evidence that Ukrainian civilians in the suburb of Bucha, some with hands bound, were killed by Russian soldiers, Moscow has claimed it is all a “hoax.”Mr. Milosevic, too, responded with a fanciful conspiracy theory when he was accused of complicity in the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in Bosnia, during which some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, many with their hands tied behind their backs. He said the people really responsible for the worst bloodbath in Europe since World War II were French intelligence operatives, Muslim officials from Bosnia and mercenaries. The wartime massacre of civilians at a Sarajevo market was not done by Serbs but staged by Muslims with bodies from a morgue, he claimed.“It is all lies,” he said, as his trial began.Whatever the echoes, legal experts say that bringing the Kremlin to account would be far more difficult than it was with Mr. Milosevic.In the first place, no sitting president has ever been handed over to an international court. While President Vladimir V. Putin has significant public support and leads a nuclear power, Mr. Milosevic had already been ousted from power by the time he was sent to The Hague in June 2001.And Russia is not Serbia.Mr. Putin is an authoritarian leader with vociferous antagonism toward the West and its legal structures.The Serbian prime minister in power when Mr. Milosevic was handed over for trial, Zoran Djindjic, was eager for a rapprochement with the West, while $30 billion in foreign aid to rebuild Serbia’s devastated economy was at stake.The burden of proof for war crimes, moreover, is very high.Even with the Serbian government’s reluctant cooperation after Mr. Djindjic was assassinated in 2003, the task was difficult because of Mr. Milosevic’s obstructionism. A defiant Mr. Milosevic refused to recognize the U.N. war crimes tribunal, lied, dissembled and called in sick when insider witnesses materialized.War crimes prosecutors are sometimes fortunate enough to have real-time evidence of atrocities at their disposal, but they still face enormous challenges. Many dots must be connected.In the case of Mr. Putin, prosecutors would have to demonstrate that he issued specific orders that led to specific atrocities or that he knew about the crimes or did nothing to prevent them. Prosecutors would also have to show that Russian commanders had intentionally targeted civilian structures, or struck them during attacks that failed to discriminate between civilian and military targets.Experts say the International Criminal Court in The Hague offers the best chance for real accountability for Russia. It was established in 1998 after separate United Nations tribunals that prosecuted mass atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia demonstrated the need for a standing judicial body to handle such cases.The United States is not among the Hague court’s 123 member nations, and Mr. Putin recently instructed his government to withdraw from the treaty that created the court. His government assailed the tribunal as “ineffective and one-sided.”By contrast, the tribunal that tried Mr. Milosevic was created by the United Nations Security Council in 1993 to track down and punish those responsible for the horrific violence against civilians during the breakup of Yugoslavia. As such, it had some political muscle behind it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-crimes.html
332,"It is hard to believe, but now impossible to deny, that the broad framework that kept much of the world stable and prospering since the end of the Cold War has been seriously fractured by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In ways we hadn’t fully appreciated, a lot of that framework rested on the West’s ability to coexist with Putin as he played “bad boy,” testing the limits of the world order but never breaching them at scale.But with Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, his indiscriminate crushing of its cities and mass killings of Ukrainian civilians, he went from “bad boy” to “war criminal.” And when the leader of Russia — a country that spans 11 time zones, with vast oil, gas and mineral resources and more nuclear warheads than anyone else — is a war criminal and must be henceforth treated as a pariah, the world as we’ve known it is profoundly changed. Nothing can work the same.How does the world have an effective U.N. with a country led by a war criminal on the Security Council, who can veto every resolution? How does the world have any effective global initiative to combat climate change and not be able to collaborate with the biggest landmass country on the planet? How does the U.S. work closely with Russia on the Iran nuclear deal when we have no trust with, and barely communicate with, Moscow? How do we isolate and try to weaken a country so big and so powerful, knowing that it could be more dangerous if it disintegrates than if it’s strong? How do we feed and fuel the world at reasonable prices when a sanctioned Russia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of oil, wheat and fertilizer?The answer is that we don’t know. Which is another way of saying that we are entering a period of geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainty the likes of which we have not known since 1989 — and possibly 1939.And it promises only to get worse before it gets better, because Putin is now like a cornered animal. He not only got so much wrong in his Ukraine invasion; he produced the opposite of so much he was aiming to achieve, making him desperate for any war achievement, at any price, that can obscure this fact.Putin said he had to go into Ukraine to push NATO away from Russia, and his war has not only reinvigorated what was a stagnating Western military alliance, it has also guaranteed NATO’s solidarity and weapons modernization for as long as Putin is in power — and probably another generation after that.Putin said he had to go into Ukraine to remove the Nazi clique ruling in Kyiv and bring both the Ukrainian people and their territory back into the arms of Mother Russia, where they naturally belonged and, in his imagination, longed to be. Instead, his invasion has made Ukrainians — even some formerly pro-Russia Ukrainians — bitter enemies of Russia for at least a generation and supercharged Ukraine’s desire to be independent of Russia and embedded in the European Union.Putin thought that with a blitzkrieg takeover of Ukraine he would earn the proper respect from the West for Russia’s military prowess — ending the insults that Russia, with an economy smaller than the state of Texas’, was just “a gas station with nukes.” Instead, his army has been exposed as incompetent and barbaric and needing to enlist mercenaries from Syria and Chechnya just to hold its ground.Having gotten so much wrong, and having launched this war on his own initiative, Putin has to be desperate to show that he produced something — at least uncontested control of eastern Ukraine, from the Donbas region, south to Odesa on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and connecting with Crimea. And he surely wants it by May 9, for Moscow’s giant annual Victory Day parade, marking Russia’s victory over the Nazis in World War II — the day when the Russian military recalls its greatest glory.So, it appears that Putin is gearing up for a two-pronged strategy. First, he’s regrouping his ravaged forces and concentrating them on fully seizing and holding this smaller military prize. Second, he’s doubling down on systematic cruelty — the continued pummeling of Ukrainian towns with rockets and artillery to keep creating as many casualties and refugees and as much economic ruin as he can. He clearly hopes that the former will fracture the Ukrainian Army, at least in the east, and the latter will fracture NATO, as its member states get overwhelmed by so many refugees and pressure Kyiv to give Putin whatever he wants to get him to stop.Ukraine and NATO, therefore, need an effective counterstrategy.It should have three pillars. The first is to support the Ukrainians with diplomacy if they want to negotiate with Putin — it’s their call — but also to support them with the best weaponry and training if they want to drive the Russian Army off every inch of their territory. The second is to broadcast daily and loudly — in every way we can — that the world is at war “with Putin” and “not with the Russian people” — just the opposite of what Putin is telling them. And the third is for us to double down on ending our addiction to oil, Putin’s main source of income.The hope is that the three together would set in motion forces inside Russia that topple Putin from power.Yes, that is a high-risk-high-reward proposition. Putin’s downfall could lead to someone worse at the helm in the Kremlin. It could also lead to prolonged chaos and disintegration.But if it leads to someone better, someone with just minimal decency and an ambition to rebuild Russia’s dignity and spheres of influence based on a new generation of Tchaikovskys, Rachmaninoffs, Sakharovs, Dostoyevskys and Sergey Brins — not yacht-owning oligarchs, cyberhackers and polonium-armed assassins — the whole world gets better. So many possibilities for healthy collaborations would be resurrected or forged.Only the Russian people have the right and ability to change their leader. But it will not be easy because Putin, an ex-K.G.B. officer — surrounded by many other former intelligence officers who are beholden to him — is nearly impossible to dislodge.But here is one possible scenario: The Russian Army is a prideful institution, and if it continues to suffer catastrophic defeats in Ukraine, I can imagine a situation where either Putin wants to decapitate his army’s leadership — to make them the scapegoats for his failure in Ukraine — or the army, knowing this is coming, tries to oust Putin first. There never has been any love lost between the Russian military and the K.G.B./S.V.R./F.S.B. security types surrounding Putin.In sum, having the Russian people produce a better leader is a necessary condition for the world to produce a new, more resilient global order to replace the post-Cold War order, which Putin has now shattered. What is also necessary, though, is that America be a model of democracy and sustainability that others want to emulate.When Ukrainians are making the ultimate sacrifice to hold onto every inch and ounce of their newly won freedom, is it too much to ask that Americans make the smallest sacrifices and compromises to hold on to our precious democratic inheritance?The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

334,"VENICE — “What happened to free speech in Italy?” shouted one of the 50 or so onlookers on Wednesday morning as a security guard stood in front of a lone antiwar protester at the Venice Biennale, trying to block out his message.The Berlin-based Russian artist Vadim Zakharov had just unfurled a banner in front of the shuttered national pavilion where he represented his country at the 2013 Biennale. The two artists and curator who were set to present work for Russia in this year’s edition pulled out in February after Russia invaded Ukraine. The pavilion has been closed ever since.Standing still and silent, Zakharov, a member of the radical Moscow Conceptualist art movement in the late 1970s, held a handwritten message that read in part: “I protest against Russia’s propaganda and the Russian invasion.”ImageThe artist Vadim Zakharov protesting outside Russia’s pavlion on Wednesday.Credit...Gus Powell for The New York TimesThe Italian guard, a member of the Biennale’s own security services, immediately called for backup. The banner was confiscated, but, after polite negotiations, the protester was allowed to conduct interviews with reporters for about 20 minutes, then left.“I’m not in Red Square,” said a smiling Zakharov as he walked away through the Biennale’s garden precinct, among those lucky enough to have tickets for the four-day preview of what is perhaps the world’s most prestigious and elegant art event. The fashionably sneakered crowd was perhaps not quite ready for political activism at that moment.This year’s Venice Biennale, which opens to the public Saturday and runs through Nov. 27, is the first since 1942 to be held while a war of foreign aggression rages in Europe. The main exhibition was inspired by 20th century Surrealism, and there was certainly a surreal feel to the event: While the cool contemporary art crowd strolled among the exhibits, Ukraine was being pummeled by missiles, and there was hardly a Russian in sight. But curators, collectors, dealers and artists were staging plenty of events to support Ukraine, and a passionate personal address by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, finally shook the Biennale out of its reverie.The Biennale’s main exhibition, titled “The Milk of Dreams” and featuring more than 200 artists, predominantly female and nonbinary, was selected by Cecilia Alemani, the director and chief curator of High Line Art in New York. Taking the imaginative world of the Surrealist artist Leonora Carrington as its starting point, the curatorial theme of “a world set free, brimming with possibilities” seemed to have been overtaken by events. But the sprawling two-venue presentation’s emphasis on contemporary artists who challenge the “presumed universal ideal of the white, male ‘Man of Reason’” was definitely in tune with the moment.Image“Hangin’ There, Baby” (2021) by Christina Quarles, which is included in the Biennale’s main exhibition, “The Milk of Dreams.”Credit...Christina Quarles; Hauser & Wirth, and Pilar Corrias“These are some of the more explicitly violent works that I’ve made,” said the Los Angeles-based artist Christina Quarles, speaking in front of “Hangin’ There Baby,” a large 2021 canvas in the show that seems to depict mutilated body parts hanging from a tree, evoking unsettling memories of Goya’s “Disasters of War” series.“People are saying, what is the relevance of art when there are so many real-life things happening?” said Quarles, who is among the international art world’s most highly regarded young painters. “One of the things that art is able to do is make these unexpected connections.”On March 2, in response to the Russian invasion, the Biennale announced that it would “collaborate in every way with the national participation of Ukraine” in this year’s edition. At the same time, it said, the Biennale “would not accept the presence at any of its events of official delegations, institutions or persons tied in any capacity to the Russian government.”Russian visitors — and their yachts — have been conspicuous absentees this year. In 2011, Roman Abramovich outraged local Venetians by mooring his nearly 400-foot megayacht in waters just three minutes’ walk from the Biennale. Abramovic is now one of the many Russian billionaires subject to international sanctions, and several of their yachts have been seized by authorities worldwide.“I’ve heard no Russians,” said Konstantin Akinsha, a Ukrainian-American curator, in an interview at a cafe on the Zattere, Venice’s southern edge. “By now we would have had hordes of them. In the golden days, Abramovich’s yacht would arrive, and then there would be another, and another,” he added.ImageSimone Leigh’s “Brick House,” a 16-foot bust previously on the High Line in New York, in “The Milk of Dreams.”Credit...Gus Powell for The New York Times“International contemporary art was seen in Russia as a symbol of modernity, a return to the West. Now it is a symbol of politician subversion,” said Akinsha. He pointed toward the nearby V-A-C Foundation, a contemporary art museum in a waterfront palazzo created in 2017 by the Russian billionaire Leonid Mikhelson, who also financed the enormous GES-2 museum in Moscow. The wood-and-bronze doors of V-A-C were firmly locked on Wednesday, and the museum said in an email that its activities were “suspended at this time.”While Russians stay away, the Biennale and the art world are doing what they can to help Ukraine. The Ukrainian steel magnate and art collector Victor Pinchuk, who in recent years spent millions on trophy works by international stars such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, and also founded a contemporary art center in Kyiv, was the driver behind the exhibition “This is Ukraine: Defending Freedom,” in the stately, recently restored Scuola Grande della Misericordia in the north of Venice.How the Ukraine War Is Affecting the Cultural WorldCard 1 of 6Gavriel Heine. The American conductor, a fixture at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, for 15 years, has resigned from his post as one of the state-run theater’s resident conductors. He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov. Ukraine’s best-known living composer, Mr. Silvestrov made his way from his home in Kyiv to Berlin, where he is now sheltering. In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko. The superstar Russian soprano faced backlash in Russia after she tried to distance herself from President Vladimir V. Putin with a statement condemning the war. She had previously lost work in the West because of her past support for Mr. Putin.Olga Smirnova. A principal soloist at the Bolshoi Ballet since 2016, Ms. Smirnova announced that she had joined the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, becoming one of the most significant Russian cultural figures to leave the country because of its invasion of Ukraine.Valery Gergiev. The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.An official Biennale satellite event, the two-part presentation showcases works specially commissioned by Pinchuk from established international names like Hirst, Marina Abramovic and Olafur Eliasson, as well as from Ukrainian contemporary artists, including the internationally exhibited Nikita Kadan. It also presents two paintings by the self-taught 20th century folk artist Maria Prymachenko, dozens of whose works were destroyed by Russian troops in the war’s early days.At the Thursday evening opening of “This is Ukraine,” co-organized by the country’s culture ministry, attendees received a rousing, livestreamed address by Zelensky, who vividly described the horrors his people were enduring. Dressed in his trademark khaki fleece, with a digital Ukrainian flag fluttering behind him, Zelensky said, “There are no tyrannies that would not try to limit art. Because they can see the power of art. Art can tell the world things that cannot be shared otherwise.”ImageThe exhibition “This is Ukraine: Defending Freedom,” an official Biennale satellite event, is at the recently restored Scuola Grande della Misericordia in the north of Venice.Credit...Gus Powell for The New York TimesTwo hours later, in the even more stately Scuola Grande di San Rocco, with its celebrated paintings by Jacopo Tintoretto, the virtuoso auctioneer Simon de Pury conducted a gala sale of 15 works by some of the contemporary art world’s best-known names to benefit museums and charitable organizations in Ukraine. More than 200 people attended the event, with tickets costing up to 10,000 euros. The auction itself raised €1.2 million, with a top price of €375,000 for a 2021 painting by Richard Prince. A further online-only auction of more than 40 works will finish on Sunday.“We have to present something,” said Zakharov, the protesting artist, as he walked away from the Russian pavilion on Wednesday. Smartphones were informing passing Biennale-goers that the Russian army had threatened to “eliminate” the remaining defenders of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.“The world is becoming more and more crazy,” said Zakharov. “We do what we can do.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/arts/design/venice-biennale-russia-ukraine.html
335,"KYIV, Ukraine — In 2014, my mother fled her home in eastern Ukraine.She didn’t want to. She’d just started a new job as a teacher and was keen to carry on her work. But as Russia-backed separatists waged war in Donetsk, the situation became unbearable. One October morning, she packed her bags, said her goodbyes and left.When I met her in Kyiv, near the underground, we stood there sobbing violently. Her life was ruined. She left behind an apartment where she’d spent her entire life, her close friends and family. I was 20, a student and a newcomer to the capital, unable to financially support her.In time, she found a job and settled somewhere we always assumed would be free from Russian attack: Bucha, a small, pleasant town outside Kyiv. There, along with many other eastern Ukrainians who’d fled the conflict, she slowly built a life for herself. The war in the east ground on, but at least she was safe.Or so we thought. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine shattered our hopes of security. It also caught me by surprise: Through the months of Russia’s military buildup, I knew the east was at grave risk of Russian aggression. But I assumed it would stop there. Instead, President Vladimir Putin launched a brutal war on the entire country — and my mother, in Bucha, was suddenly at risk. Once again, she had to flee.Far from exceptional, my mother’s story is illustrative. Donetsk and Bucha, the two homes from which she’s been expelled, are bywords for the pitiless destruction Russia has unleashed on Ukraine. In Donetsk, Russia-backed forces tortured detained civilians. In Bucha, as the world has been shocked to discover, the Russian military massacred civilians and committed horrific atrocities. In each place, ordinary Ukrainians like my mother have striven to live their lives — to go to work, to tend to their loved ones, to simply be. But Russia wouldn’t let them.In the eight years since the conflict began in Donetsk, my family had little to complain about. Yes, we had been separated — but everyone was alive. Given that the conflict has claimed more than 14,000 lives, that’s no small piece of fortune. My father, an electrician, repaired energy networks: In heavily shelled Donetsk, it was busy work. My aunt started a family of her own there, stubbornly refusing to allow the conflict to dominate her life. I missed them endlessly — I was blacklisted in Donetsk for my reporting and haven’t been able to visit my childhood home — yet was cheered by the hope, shared by us all, that the fighting would end at some point.But those distant dreams were destroyed by Mr. Putin’s recognition, on Feb. 21, of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russia-backed separatists had established their so-called republics. I was stunned. His announcement in effect laid claim to the entirety of the Donbas region, an area three times larger than the one already controlled by Russian-backed troops. It was a green light to move forward and seize the rest of the region.For my family, this was a disaster. My father was suddenly at risk of being conscripted into the army to fight against his fellow Ukrainians. My aunt was in danger of being sent away, too — but to Russia rather than Ukraine. So-called evacuation efforts, transporting eastern Ukrainians to Russia under the pretense of imminent Ukrainian attacks, had been stepped up.Three days later, explosions in Kyiv heralded the beginning of a full-scale invasion. It felt like déjà vu. My mother and I already lived through it eight years ago. We had the exact same conversations: I would ask her to leave Donetsk, and she would refuse. She wanted to stay at home. Now I asked her to leave Bucha, but she wouldn’t do it. She didn’t want to be displaced for a second time.When I finally talked her into leaving, we were too late: Russian troops had taken over Bucha. The first reports about locals being slaughtered by Russian soldiers started appearing; I could not stop picturing my mother as the next victim. I saw photographs of places I’d been to with my mother — like a shopping mall near her apartment — that had been demolished. I told her not to leave the basement of her building, if possible, but she didn’t listen. Only when she came under heavy shelling while shopping for groceries did she stop going out. She’s always been stubborn.For the next 10 days, she stayed in that basement. There was no electricity or heating, and she was running out of food and water. It was terrifying: Artillery fired nonstop while Russian tanks parked next to her building. When her neighbor tried to take a picture, he was shot — luckily, he survived but his apartment was ruined. Not long after, Russian soldiers visited the building: They inspected residents’ homes, checked passports and took away mobile SIM cards. (My mother, in a remarkable flash of cunning, gave them the wrong one so she could keep in touch with me.)The ordeal was intolerable. My mother, hungry, exhausted and frightened, finally agreed to leave. Two days later, on March 10, she managed it, escaping through a humanitarian corridor to Kyiv. She was shaken up when I met her. I covered her in all the duvets and blankets I had and put her to bed. But in the night, I could hear her groaning. When I asked her what she was dreaming about, she said that the Russians were torturing her. It was the sign of a trauma that will stay with her for a long while.The next day I put her on a train to safety. She’s now in western Ukraine, staying with some relatives, an internally displaced person once again. She lost her job and her home, twice. Yet she’s lucky to be alive, unlike hundreds of her neighbors buried in Bucha’s mass graves. They join at least 1,964 other civilians whose lives have been extinguished by Russian force.Bucha itself, or rather what is left of it, is free now. Russian troops withdrew from Kyiv’s environs by April 6. They’re redeploying to the east, where a battle for the Donbas lies in store. The war, which began in the east eight years ago, is returning there for its culmination. Given Russia’s brutality — which now extends to the possible use of chemical weapons in besieged Mariupol — it’s likely to be a terrible contest.For Ukrainians, it will be the latest installment of horror. But the country, like my family, is standing strong. East and west, displaced and not, Ukrainians have acted with bravery and resilience. No matter what Russia does to us, we refuse to be beaten.Anna Myroniuk (@AnnaMyroniuk) is the head of investigations at The Kyiv Independent, a Ukrainian news site.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

336,"The signs of failure in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are readily apparent: the tattered reputation of its military as a modernized, overpowering fighting force; its tattered economy; and a Western alliance more unified than at any time since the worst tensions of the Cold War.But what is less appreciated is that this is only the latest and potentially the most spectacular in a series of failures suffered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Ukraine. If Afghanistan is the “graveyard of empires,” Ukraine is where Mr. Putin’s imperial ambitions consistently flounder.In fact, the main reason the Russian leader took such a potentially self-destructive step as a whole scale invasion, some analysts believe, was to reverse a long line of fiascos dating back to Ukraine’s so-called Orange Revolution in 2004, during the early years of Mr. Putin’s presidency.“He has been obsessed with Ukraine since the early 2000s because Ukraine became the field where he kept losing, the only field where he kept losing,” said Mikhail Fishman, the former host of a political talk show on TV Rain, the now shuttered independent television network.Mr. Putin has long plotted to undermine Ukraine, overtly and covertly, and has notched some wins along the way. He has kept the country bogged down in a grinding war in the east, sowed discord among the political class and damaged its infrastructure with experimental cyberattacks — techniques later exported to the United States and elsewhere.But on at least three significant occasions when Mr. Putin intervened directly to bring Ukraine under Russia’s heel, he was thwarted.There is always the chance that he could prevail this time, whether by reducing Ukraine’s cities to rubble or seizing a large chunk of the country in the east and south and declaring victory. Support for the war at home seems to be strong.But even those outcomes would bring costs, reinforcing Ukrainians’ hatred for Russia, cementing Moscow’s status as a pariah to the West and almost certainly requiring a lengthy and expensive occupation.ImageDestroyed Russian armoured vehicles at a frontline position in the northern region of Kyiv last week.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesHistory has tended to smite Russian leaders who launched what they wrongly anticipated would be short, victorious wars. The Russian Revolution that ended 300 years of Romanov rule erupted a few years after Czar Nicholas II lost a disastrous war against the Japanese, while the Soviet Union collapsed in the wake of its debacle in Afghanistan.Some analysts believe that Mr. Putin is risking a similar fate. “He will lose Russia because of Ukraine,” said Mr. Fishman, who has just finished a book about why democracy failed to take hold in Russia after the Soviet collapse. Others are less emphatic, especially in the short term, and note the popular signs of support for him inside Russia. Still, they caution that Mr. Putin is uncharacteristically playing a poker game with an unpredictable ending.“This has been a major failure in Europe’s biggest land war since 1945, and that is a big failure,” said Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk assessment firm. “I would not bet futures in Russian political stability over a five-year period.”While Mr. Putin has publicly emphasized the security threat posed by a westward leaning Ukraine as a reason for going to war, others say his deepest concern is the possible political fallout from living next door to a boisterous democracy with decent economic prospects.“Putin’s ultimate nightmare is a color revolution in Russia, and that is the lens through which he views people voting in Ukraine,” said Mr. Kupchan. “Because it is so close, culturally, the threat of contagion as he perceives it is even greater.”Mr. Putin’s successes are legion, especially his entire career arc from an obscure, midlevel intelligence agent — forced to drive a taxi to make ends meet after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc — to becoming one of the longest-running leaders ever to occupy the Kremlin.Yet in Ukraine, Mr. Putin, 69, has taken repeated missteps.In 2004, he campaigned personally in the presidential election on behalf of his preferred candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, whom he twice congratulated on his win. But widespread accusations of voting fraud sparked a nationalist backlash and the Orange Revolution, with street protests culminating ultimately in the election of Viktor A. Yushchenko (who was poisoned during the campaign) as president in a Western-oriented government.ImageThe 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine ousted the Kremlin’s handpicked candidate and culminated in the election of Viktor A. Yushchenko in 2005.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesIn 2006, Mr. Putin tried to wrest greater control over — and profits from — the natural gas distribution system carrying Russian supplies across Ukraine to Europe, creating an uproar by cutting the flow in the middle of winter. He backed down when it became apparent that he risked losing energy markets in Europe if supplies of Russian gas could not be relied upon.

To head that off, he dangled a $15 billion loan that Mr. Yanukovych — by then the legitimately elected but incorrigibly corrupt president — accepted. As in 2003, that triggered massive street protests on Kyiv’s Independence Square, or Maidan. After police violence encouraged by Moscow failed to deter the demonstrators, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia in February 2014.Mr. Putin called it an American-inspired coup and invaded Crimea, eventually annexing it, and kindled a separatist war in the Donbas region, the resource-rich rust belt of eastern Ukraine. He thought he had found a means to dominate Kyiv in a proposed treaty called the Minsk agreements, which would have given the separatists veto power over important central government decisions. But the deal was never implemented, and the war became a grinding impasse that by 2022 had killed 14,000 people, many of them civilians.ImageRussian troops without insignia, like these at a Ukrainian military compound outside of Sevastopol, seized Crimea in 2014 against only token resistance. Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesAs the failures piled up, Mr. Putin began to denigrate Ukraine. He claimed that it was not a real country, but an artifice cobbled together by Lenin using different bits of Russian land, and in recent years said it was presided over by a “Nazi” government that Ukrainians — particularly ethnic Russians in the country’s eastern parts — would be glad to see overthrown.Curiously, Mr. Putin sketched out his ultimate plans for Ukraine in 2014, after he annexed Crimea. While holding court at his annual televised town hall meeting, he made a surprise pronouncement about “Novorossiya,” or New Russia, an arc stretching along the entire coast and eastern side of Ukraine.“I would like to remind you that what was called Novorossiya back in the czarist days — Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev and Odesa — were not part of Ukraine back then,” he said. “Russia lost those territories for various reasons, but the people remained.”Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance. Speaking after a risky and secret visit to Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken’s visit. The strikes were part of a broader assault aimed at crippling critical infrastructure in Ukraine.Diplomatic changes. President Biden nominated Bridget Brink, the current U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, as ambassador to Ukraine, which would fill a position that has remained empty for more than a year. The move comes as Mr. Blinken said that U.S. diplomats will begin returning to the country next week.In the current invasion, the Russian military has attacked all six cities he mentioned. Yet, leaving aside Luhansk and Donetsk in the separatist regions, Russian troops have managed to capture only Kherson, with the rest resisting fiercely, apparently to Mr. Putin’s surprise.The example of Novorossiya provides a clue to as to why Mr. Putin failed so consistently in his efforts to subjugate Ukraine.In the late 18th century, when Catherine the Great toured the same newly conquered lands of Novorossiya, the phrase “Potemkin village” was born to describe the facades erected by one of her generals to conceal the region’s grinding poverty and backwardness.ImageHaving failed to take Ukraine in a lightning dash, Mr. Putin kas taken to pulverizing Ukrainian cities, producing scenes like this one at the regional headquarters building in Kharkiv.Credit...Aris Messinis/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhen it comes to Ukraine, analysts say, Mr. Putin seems to have constructed a Potemkin village in his own mind, deluding himself that Russian-speaking, southeastern Ukraine, home to millions of ethnic Russians, yearned to be part of the Motherland again.What Mr. Putin failed to recognize is that 30 years of democratic elections had gradually engendered a sense of nationhood among Ukrainians, analysts said. People realized that they enjoyed far greater freedoms in their new country, despite its corruption, than under the oppressive autocracy that Mr. Putin sought to impose.When the invasion failed to produce the quick results Mr. Putin envisioned, bogging down amid numerous self-inflicted wounds, analysts say Mr. Putin turned to the wanton destruction of Ukraine — punishing its 44 million citizens for their long history of rejecting his attempts to incorporate the country into his Russki Mir, or Russian World.“I think he sees Ukrainians as traitors now, because they are not falling into his vision of Russki Mir,” said Fiona Hill, an adviser on Russia to President Trump and his two predecessors, as well as the co-author of a biography on Mr. Putin and currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Putin and his Kremlin cronies have long blamed their failures on American arrogance, deceit and manipulation, the standard fallback position for anyone from the Soviet-trained establishment. In the current disaster, they have again raised phantom fears of NATO missile bases and chemical weapons labs in Ukraine.ImageVolunteers using sandbags to fortify the Princess Olga Monument in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, on Wednesday.

For Mr. Putin, his greatest blind spot has arguably been Ukraine.“If you live in the world where people actually matter and their voice matters, that is a different world from Putin,” said Mr. Fishman. “It is always about some secret deals that the powerful running the world achieve.”Ultimately, the invasion seems already to represent another failure for Mr. Putin in Ukraine, perhaps his greatest, wrecking his quest to become the historical hero who reconstituted the Russian Empire.“Without Ukraine it means nothing,” said Mr. Fishman of Mr. Putin’s quest. “He will never get political control over Ukraine, it is out of the question.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/02/world/europe/putin-ukraine-failure.html
337,"When bombs began falling on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv late last month, forcing Vera Lytovchenko to shelter in the basement of her apartment building, she took her violin with her, hoping it might bring comfort.In the weeks since, Lytovchenko, a violinist for the Kharkiv Theater of Opera and Ballet, has given impromptu concerts almost every day for a group of 11 neighbors. In the cold, cramped basement, with nothing in the way of decoration except candles and yellow tulips, she has performed Vivaldi, Tchaikovsky and Ukrainian folk songs.“My music can show that we are still human,” she said in an interview. “We need not just food or water. We need our culture. We are not like animals now. We still have our music, and we still have our hope.”As their cities have come under siege by Russian forces, Ukrainian artists have turned to music for comfort and connection, filling streets, apartment buildings and train stations with the sounds of Beethoven and Mozart.A cellist performed Bach in the center of a deserted street in Kharkiv, with the blown-out windows of the regional police headquarters behind him. A trumpeter played the Ukrainian national anthem in a subway station being used as a bomb shelter. A pianist played a Chopin étude in her apartment, surrounded by ashes and debris left by Russian shelling.Impromptu performances by ordinary citizens have been a feature of many modern conflicts, in the Balkans, Syria and elsewhere. In the social media age, they have become an important way for artists in war zones to build a sense of community and bring attention to suffering. Here are several notable examples.The Pianist of YarmoukVideotranscriptBackbars0:00/2:45-0:00transcriptThe Piano Man of YarmoukAeham Ahmad became a YouTube star by playing piano in the ruins of a Damascus, Syria, neighborhood.

Sometimes friends and neighbors sang along. The news media began calling Ahmad the “pianist of Yarmouk.”At the time, government troops kept his neighborhood cordoned off, hitting it with artillery and sometimes airstrikes, as insurgent groups fought for control. Many people suffered from a lack of access to food and medicine; some died.“I want to give them a beautiful dream,” Ahmad told The New York Times in 2013. “To change this black color at least into gray.”Musicians have long played a role in helping people cope with the physical and psychological devastation of war.“They’re trying to recreate community, which has been fractured by war,” said Abby Anderton, an associate professor of music at Baruch College who has studied music in the aftermath of war. “People have a real desire to create normalcy, even if everything around them seems to be disintegrating.”The Cellist of SarajevoDuring the Bosnian war in 1992, Vedran Smailovic became known as the “cellist of Sarajevo” after he commemorated the dead by playing Albinoni’s Adagio in G minor every day at 4 p.m. in the ruins of a downtown square in Sarajevo. He kept playing even as 155-millimeter howitzer shells whistled down on the city.“Many, like Mr. Smailovic, who played the cello for the Sarajevo Opera, reach for an anchor amid the chaos by doing something, however small, that carries them back to the stable, reasoned life they led before,” The Times reported then.“My mother is a Muslim and my father is a Muslim, but I don’t care,” Smailovic said at the time. “I am a Sarajevan, I am a cosmopolitan, I am a pacifist.” He added: “I am nothing special, I am a musician, I am part of the town.

He said in a series of interviews that he had been increasingly disturbed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Valentin Silvestrov.

In recent weeks, his consoling music has taken on new significance for listeners in his war-torn country.Anna Netrebko.

The star Russian maestro and vocal supporter of Mr. Putin was removed from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Russia’s actions in Ukraine. His abrupt dismissal came three years before his contract was set to expire.Alexei Ratmansky. The choreographer, who grew up in Kyiv, was preparing a new ballet at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow when the invasion began, and immediately decided to leave Moscow. The ballet, whose premiere was set for March 30, was postponed indefinitely.In 2016, the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a friend and prominent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, led a patriotic concert in the Syrian city of Palmyra, shortly after Russian airstrikes helped drive the Islamic State out of the city.On Russian television, the concert was spliced with videos of Islamic State atrocities, part of a propaganda effort to nurture pride in Russia’s military, including its support for the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Putin was shown thanking the musicians by video link from his vacation home on the Black Sea.Classical music has long been used for political purposes. Emily Richmond Pollock, an associate professor of music at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it has often been invoked in wartime because “it has been constructed as timeless and powerful and human.”But much music is also abstract, which has led to it being used in different ways.“You can think of pieces like Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, which has been used in moments of liberal triumph and right-wing triumph alike,” Pollock said. “Many pieces are very malleable.”‘Shared Humanity’Performances in war zones capture the public’s attention in part because of their juxtapositions with scenes of destruction and despair. This helps explain their wide popularity on social media, which has become an important tool for artists in conflict zones to bring attention to suffering around them.“They can use Instagram and social media platforms to involve people who might be geographically distant in their very real struggle,” Professor Anderton said. “When we hear someone play a Chopin étude or prelude on a destroyed piano, there’s a sense of shared humanity.”When Russia began its invasion in late February, Illia Bondarenko, a conservatory student in Kyiv, was looking for a way to highlight Ukraine’s struggles. Working with the violinist Kerenza Peacock, who is based in Los Angeles, he started what he called a “violin flash mob.” He mixed together a video of him performing a Ukrainian folk song in a basement shelter with virtual performances by 94 musicians around the world.“It’s a great message for all civilizations in the world that Ukrainian people are not weak and we are strong,” Bondarenko said in an interview. “We will not give up and we will hold out, no matter what.”Lytovchenko, the violinist, has continued to post performances online. She is planning to record a duet with a pianist who lives overseas and said she had raised about $10,000 to help Ukrainian families.“I’m not sure that my music can resist the violence and stop the war; I am not so naïve,” she said. “But maybe it can show that we are not so aggressive, that we don’t have hatred in our hearts, that we still can be human.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/arts/music/ukraine-music-war-zones.html
338,"WASHINGTON — Senior Biden administration officials say they believe that the next four weeks will shape the eventual outcome of Russia’s war in Ukraine, with long-lasting ramifications that will influence the drawing of the map of Europe for decades to come.While the officials still expect the war to be long and grinding, they say that it is imperative to rush Ukraine as many new weapons as possible — especially long-range artillery and anti-artillery radar — to push back Russia’s new advance in the eastern Donbas region.Reflecting the renewed sense of urgency, President Biden announced on Thursday that the United States would send Ukraine an additional $800 million in military aid, the second such package in just over a week.Mr. Biden said the latest aid package sent “an unmistakable message” to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: “He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine.”In remarks at the White House, Mr. Biden said that while the United States would announce many details of the arms it is shipping to Ukraine, some of the weaponry would be kept secret. The president borrowed, and modified, a famous line by Theodore Roosevelt, saying that the United States would “speak softly and carry a large Javelin,” a reference to the antitank weapon that the Ukrainians have used effectively against Russian armor.Determined to move swiftly, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with allies around the world this week and characterized the next month as pivotal.If Russia can push through in the east, Mr. Putin will be better positioned at home to sell his so-called “special military operation” as a limited success and claim he has secured protection for Ukraine’s pro-Russia minority, American officials said. He might then seek a cease-fire but would be emboldened to use the Donbas as leverage in any negotiations, they said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.But if the Ukrainian military can stop Russia’s advance in the Donbas, officials say Mr. Putin will be faced with a stark choice: commit more combat power to a fight that could drag on for years or negotiate in earnest at peace talks.The first option might mean a full national mobilization, officials say, and is politically risky for the Russian leader.The next phase of the war “will be critically important,” said Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who visited Ukraine in March. “The escalation of hostilities in Donbas, and all areas affected by the armed conflict, is of utmost concern.”At the Pentagon this week, both Mr. Austin and General Milley have had nonstop phone calls and meetings with allies centered on one topic: weapons. Mr. Austin spoke with his Romanian counterpart on Monday and with the Spanish defense minister on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he met with the Polish defense minister, and on Thursday, he huddled with his Czech counterpart.ImagePresident Biden with Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, center, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, right, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, at the White House on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced an additional $800 million in military aid for Ukraine.Credit...Sarahbeth Maney/The New York TimesWith all four, the discussions were the same, officials said: how to ship more powerful weapons to Ukraine in the coming weeks.After weeks of focusing on antitank and antiaircraft weaponry like Javelins and Stingers, the new shipments over the last week have included long-range artillery, tactical vehicles and mobile radar systems to help the Ukrainians detect and destroy Russian artillery positions.Other countries are sending tanks, more artillery and anti-ship missiles.General Milley’s phone log this week looks like a roll call of countries with heavy artillery and weaponry: Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey.A senior Defense Department official described the next month as a crucial turning point for both Russia and Ukraine. This phase of the battle ostensibly favors Russia to some degree, as Russian troops move over more open terrain as opposed to getting bogged down in cities.But the official said the Pentagon believed that with the right weapons and a continuation of high morale and motivation, the Ukrainian forces might not only stop the Russian advance, but also push it back.“The Russians are in a weakened state from which they may well be able to recover given enough time and new conscripts,” said Evelyn N. Farkas, the top Pentagon policy official for Russia and Ukraine during the Obama administration, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. “Therefore, it is paramount to strike at them now with everything we can give the Ukrainians.”Current and former U.S. military commanders with experience in Ukraine and Europe agreed.“It is make or break for Ukraine in that they must stop the Russian advance to seize all of the Donbas,” Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a retired former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe who has been involved with Ukrainian defense matters since 2016, wrote in an email.If Mr. Putin succeeds in seizing the east and establishes a land corridor to Crimea, General Repass said that Moscow would have a stronger position in any negotiated settlement.“In another month, I anticipate exhaustion on both sides without a military decision/outcome either way,” General Repass wrote. “A stalemate means Putin wins, and if Putin ‘wins’ we are in for a rough ride.”To try to prevent such an outcome, current and former American commanders say Ukraine’s army will seek to disrupt Russia’s military buildup around the eastern city of Izium and other important staging areas with long-range artillery and armed drone attacks.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“It is also about disrupting the Russians while they are still in reconstitution and preparation mode, before they can really get back up on their feet,” said Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, a former top U.S. Army commander in Europe who is now with the Center for European Policy Analysis.Even as Moscow narrows its goals and consolidates its army in southern and eastern Ukraine, the outcome of the war remains unclear at best, military analysts said. Indeed, the underlying weaknesses in the Russian force, which were exposed in the early weeks of the conflict, have not necessarily gone away, they said.For instance, the thousands of Russian reinforcements pouring into Ukraine — including mercenaries, conscripts and troops pulled from far eastern Russia and Georgia — have not trained together, analysts said.ImageUkrainian soldiers towed a captured Russian tank in Nova Basan, Ukraine, this month. As Russian forces push into the Donbas, they will extend their supply lines and could confront the same logistics shortfalls that bedeviled them before, officials said.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesThe battered units that retreated from northern Ukraine will also need time to regroup. Some will be replenished and sent back to the fight. But others are so damaged that their remaining pieces will be patched together into one new unit, analysts said.“They don’t have many options for generating new forces if the current units face too much attrition,” said Rob Lee, a Russian military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia and a former U.S. Marine officer.“Once this offensive begins in earnest, Russia will face more losses,” Mr. Lee said. “At a certain point, attrition will be too great and will limit the Russian military’s ability to effectively conduct offensive operations.”As Russian forces push into the Donbas, they will extend their supply lines and could confront the same logistics shortfalls that bedeviled them before, officials said.“We’ll see in the next few weeks how much they’ve learned and how much they’ve fixed,” General Hodges said.Even if Russian forces prevail in the next month or so, the specter of that army then advancing on western Ukraine or beyond Ukraine’s borders — a real fear at the start of the war — now seems far-fetched, several officials said.“Win, lose or draw, the Russian military is likely to be a spent force after this next phase,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va. “Russia would be hard-pressed to sustain any campaign beyond the Donbas.” But the senior Defense Department official warned that for Mr. Putin, all of Ukraine — not just the Donbas — has always been the ultimate prize.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military-biden.html

The site works on a dropship model, with Angel for Fashion taking a percentage of sales in exchange for hosting the products on its site. Orders placed on the site are forwarded to the designers, who handle fulfillment and shipping, the cost of which is included in the garment’s price.Currently, there are more than 800 items available, although some products are available only for pre-order or come with caveats that shipping could be delayed because of supply chain logistics in a country at war.Some of her designers, Ms. Sidary said, never stopped sketching, sewing and designing, even as their city and country came under attack. Others have repurposed their operations to help the war effort, relocated within Ukraine or are traveling back and forth between Ukraine and neighboring countries.ImageBob BassetCredit...via Bob Basset“I did throw on the site that it could take up to six months only because I prefer to not over-promise and under-deliver,” Ms. Sidary said of potential shipping delays, speaking via Zoom in her smoky Southern California accent. “I mean, I hope things don’t take six months.”She added proudly that the site would be available globally, except in Russia and Belarus, which she referred to as “Bela-Russia.”Ms. Sidary was enjoying a celebratory tequila on the rocks. Her nails were painted fluorescent yellow, the middle fingers painted blue in what she said was a kiss-off to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. “They’re growing out — at some point I’ve got to get a new manicure,” she said. “But to get this live in three weeks, I’ve literally been working 17-hour days.”ImageKofta StudioCredit...via Kofta StudioThe idea for the website came to Ms. Sidary at the end of February, when she returned to West Hollywood after showcasing six Ukrainian designers in New York. In a macabre coincidence, that showcase opened just one day before the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.Since shipping garments back to Ukraine was no longer an option, Ms. Sidary took four of the designers’ collections back to her one-bedroom apartment. She also took in Valery Kovalska, a designer specializing in unexpected tweaks to modern basics, who also happened to be in New York during the invasion.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 3A bolder American stance.

Austin III said that the United States wanted Russia to be “weakened” and unable to rebuild its military from its many losses in Ukraine, reflecting an increasingly emboldened approach from the Biden administration.On the ground. ​​Russia rained down a barrage of missiles on at least five railway stations across central and western Ukraine, hours after Mr. Austin and Secretary of State Antony J.

It supports our industry.”Ms. Bairamova, like Ms. Kovalska, was in New York on business when the invasion started and now is staying with friends on Roosevelt Island indefinitely.

340,"Intense fighting continued around a large steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol, in what appeared to be one of the last redoubts of Ukrainian forces in the besieged city, an adviser to the mayor said on Monday.Pyotr Andryushchenko, an aide to Mayor Vadym Boychenko, said that some 2,000 civilians were trapped along with the soldiers inside the Azovstal steel plant, one of Europe’s largest metal factories.Mr. Andryshchenko insisted that street fighting was continuing throughout Levoberezhny, the district that includes the factory.The Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its forces had completely surrounded the steel plant, and that the Ukrainian forces holding out “forbade negotiations about surrendering,” citing an intercepted radio transmission. The Ministry repeated a demand that the Ukrainians put down their weapons. “In case of further resistance,” the ministry said, “all of them will be eliminated.”“In reality it is not surrounded,” Mr. Andryushchenko said on Monday. “For the past few days our troops have been engaged in intense street fighting throughout Levoberezhny.” He said the majority of the fighting was taking place along a main road, called Tahanrozka, that led from the plant to the outskirts of the city.He described the steel plant as a “fortress,” but would not disclose how many troops were inside. And he denied reports that the factory held the last concentration of Ukrainian forces, claiming troops were still holed up at a pair of factories, Azovmash and Illich, elsewhere in the city.Mr. Andryushchenko and other officials left Mariupol weeks ago, and his statements could not be verified. Communication with people still in the city is extremely limited, making it impossible to get a clear picture.Taking Mariupol, a port city in southern Ukraine, is critical to Russian designs to form an unbroken land corridor stretching from the Donbas region bordering Russia to the Crimean peninsula.Maps: Tracking the Russian Invasion of UkraineHere’s how Russia wants to seize eastern Ukraine, its main objective in the war.Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said Russian forces would likely use “overwhelming firepower” to try to force the holdouts at the Azovstal factory to capitulate in the coming week. But the institute predicted in its latest assessment that the final battle with the Ukrainian defenders, who “appear intent on staging a final stand,” could cost Russia dearly.The presence of civilians in the plant, which was confirmed by the chief of the Mariupol patrol police, Mykhailo Vershynin, raised concerns about a potential humanitarian calamity stemming from both fighting and hunger.“There was not a lot of food inside the plant to begin with because it was for our troops,” Mr. Andryushchenko said. “But now they are needing to feed 2,000 people.”Many of the civilians who have gathered there arrived after their homes were destroyed by shelling or they were evicted by Russian forces, he said, and have sheltered with troops in a network of tunnels beneath the plant.Russia-Ukraine War: Key DevelopmentsCard 1 of 4U.S. wants to see Russia weakened.

The United States also said it would reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital.“These people, many wanted to avoid being displaced or deported, so they found protection with our troops, in the basement of the plant,” Mr. Andryushchenko said.The Ukrainian army had arranged two operations over the past two weeks to bring food to the plant, he said. But the situation will likely grow more dire as Russian troops have blocked anyone from entering or leaving the city.As fighting intensifies, Ukrainian officials have warned that Russian forces may turn to chemical weapons to flush the holdouts from the tunnel network under the factory.In anticipation of possible atrocities, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine accused Russia of “deliberately trying to destroy everyone” at the plant. He said he would refuse further peace talks with Moscow if its forces committed more atrocities.Mr. Andryushchenko raised disturbing reports that Russian forces were using Ukrainian civilians as human shields, putting them at risk of being killed.Outside the plant, Russian soldiers were leading civilians to the front line, he said, forcing them to register for “mobile passes” at an office close to the line of fighting, about three miles from the steel plant.The office had been installed last week by Konstantin Ivashchenko, who was recently named the “new mayor” of Mariupol by the Kremlin-backed separatist government calling itself the Donetsk People’s Republic. The passes, the existence of which has also been reported by Mariupol’s police, are required for residents to walk outside.“Some are walking long distances to the office, up to 10 miles, and then they are waiting in long lines,” Mr. Andryushchenko said. The civilians are required to wear white bands on their arms and legs. Russian solders typically wear such bands, he said, raising the possibility that they are intentionally endangering the Ukrainian civilians.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/world/ukrainians-mariupol-steel-plant.html
341,"President Biden on Tuesday for the first time accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of perpetrating genocide on the Ukrainian people, but emphasized that was his personal view, not a legal determination.The remark initially came offhandedly in a speech at a bioethanol plant in Iowa, in which Mr. Biden was announcing measures to counteract rising gas prices. About halfway through the speech, he made reference to Mr. Putin and the war’s economic impact on Americans.“Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” Mr. Biden said. It was a marked escalation from statements earlier this month, when he said Russian atrocities in the suburbs near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, amounted to war crimes, but did not rise to the level of genocide.On the tarmac later on Tuesday afternoon as he left Iowa, the president reaffirmed his characterization.“Yes, I called it genocide. It has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be Ukrainian,” he said.“We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies,” he added, “but it sure seems that way to me.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has repeatedly accused Russia of genocide, welcomed Mr. Biden’s comments. “True words of a true leader,” he wrote on Twitter. “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil.”Mr. Biden’s comment is not the same as a formal determination of genocide by the U.S. government, which has happened only eight times and triggers legal obligations under the Genocide Convention, which the United States ratified in 1988. States are required to prevent and punish genocide, and grant extradition when genocide charges are involved.In international law, genocide is defined as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/13/world/europe/biden-russia-genocide-ukraine.html

Ukraine acknowledged that Russia had captured more than three dozen villages during fighting this week in the east.But Russia has so far failed to make any major territorial gains in its offensive to seize the eastern Donbas region, according to Ukrainian and Western officials. A Russian general, Rustam Minnekayev, suggested that Russia’s aims were even broader: to take control of all of southern Ukraine and extend its territory to the pro-Russian Moldovan enclave of Transnistria. Taking Ukraine’s south would require a breakthrough that Russia has so far been unable to make.On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers are readying to prevent Russian forces from pushing toward the important industrial city of Zaporizhzhia.

Donald Trump acknowledged “some responsibility” for the riots on Jan. 6, 2021, according to an audio recording of the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy. Trump himself has never publicly accepted responsibility.And though McCarthy’s office insisted yesterday that he never planned to urge Trump to resign, audio clips say otherwise. In an audio clip obtained by The Times of a different phone call with Republican lawmakers, McCarthy said he would tell Trump of the impeachment resolution: “I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign.”The recordings lay bare the hypocrisy of Washington Republicans who privately scorned Trump but publicly defended him. McCarthy spent today making calls to assess the potential political fallout. One source reported Trump and McCarthy spoke Thursday after the story was published and had “a good conversation.”ImagePassengers at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta.Credit...Dustin Chambers for The New York Times3. The Biden administration planned to appeal the dropped mask mandate. But not everyone is convinced it’s what the president wants. After a higher court reversed the public transit mask rule on Monday, the Justice Department on Wednesday said it would appeal the ruling at the request of the C.D.C. But legal specialists speculate that the administration is only buying time to erase the decision and guard C.D.C. powers for a future crisis. If Biden wanted to bring the mandate back, some say, he would have sought a stay already.

Jerusalem’s Aqsa Mosque was once again the scene of clashes as tens of thousands of Muslims gathered to worship.Two rounds of Friday prayers at one of Jerusalem’s holiest sites, known to Jews as Temple Mount, were followed by brief unrest, keeping tensions in the Old City on a low boil. It was the seventh time in eight days that violence broke out at the site. The clashes prompted the most intense exchange of rockets and missiles in nearly a year between militants in Gaza and Israel’s armed forces.The situation began to intensify a month ago, the start of the deadliest wave of Arab attacks in Israel in more than half a decade. Those attacks killed 14 and prompted an Israeli military crackdown in the occupied West Bank, which killed at least 15 Palestinians.ImageA page from enVision Florida B.E.S.T.

343,"JERUSALEM — When Avigdor Liberman, Israel’s Soviet-born finance minister, condemned the apparent atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, this past week, he was careful not to blame Russia.“Russia is accusing Ukraine and Ukraine is accusing Russia,” and Israel should avoid adjudicating one way or the other, Mr. Liberman told a radio station last Monday. “We here need to maintain Israel’s moral stand on the one hand,” he added, “and Israel’s interests on the other.”It was a comment that underscored two aspects of today’s Israel: the Israeli government’s cautious approach to the war in Ukraine and the political and social role played by Russian-speaking Israelis from post-Soviet countries, particularly Kremlin-connected Russian-Israeli businessmen.Israel has expressed repeated support for Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish. It has sent humanitarian aid, set up a field hospital in western Ukraine and voted on Thursday to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council. But it has not sent military equipment or enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs.The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has generally avoided direct criticism of Russia, pointedly leaving condemnations of the Kremlin to the foreign minister, Yair Lapid — most recently on Sunday, when the Foreign Ministry condemned a recent Russian airstrike that killed at least 50 people at a Ukrainian train station.That delicate balancing act is seen as an attempt to allow Israel to mediate between the two sides, to avoid exposing Jews in both Russia and Ukraine to antisemitic attacks, and to maintain its delicate relationship with the Russian military in Syria. ImageWidespread destruction could be seen across Bucha, Ukraine, a suburb northwest of Kyiv from which Russian forces recently withdrew.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesIsrael’s reluctance to anger Russia has nevertheless heightened scrutiny of the influence of Russian-speaking businessmen and politicians on Israeli policymaking and society.Of Israel’s 9.2 million citizens, about 13 percent are from the former Soviet Union and qualified for citizenship through their Jewish ancestry. Some, like Mr. Liberman or Zeev Elkin, another cabinet minister, have become major political figures. Others, like Yitzchak Mirilashvili, who owns a right-wing Israeli television channel, control media outlets that help shape public discourse. Several, most prominently Roman Abramovich, the billionaire punished in Britain for his links to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, have become major donors to Israeli institutions.At least four other Russian-speaking Israelis have had sanctions imposed against them by other countries for their connections to the Russian government.But though Russian-Israeli oligarchs do wield influence, experts say they are not the reason for Israel’s neutral stance on the Ukraine war, which is driven by national security concerns.“Frankly, I do not see an impact by those pro-Putin oligarchs on the government,” said Leonid Nevzlin, a Russian-Israeli billionaire who owns a minority stake in a major Israeli newspaper, the left-leaning Haaretz.Instead, Israel’s position on Ukraine is based on “the common opinion of the Israeli establishment,” Mr. Nevzlin said in a phone interview. “The main priority is the interests of the State of Israel.”ImageAvigdor Liberman, Israel’s finance minister, in 2020 outside the Parliament building in Jerusalem. Mr. Liberman condemned the apparent atrocities in Bucha this month, but was careful not to blame Russia.Credit...Dan Balilty for The New York TimesLike many in the Russian-speaking Israeli community, Mr. Nevzlin is a longtime opponent of Mr. Putin, and he said he was giving up his Russian passport shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.About a third of Israel’s Russian-speaking citizens are of Ukrainian background, roughly the same number as those originally from Russia itself, according to government data.Ihor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian oligarch considered to be a patron of Mr. Zelensky during his election campaign, is also an Israeli citizen. The brother of Mr. Elkin still lives in Kharkiv, a Ukrainian city that has come under heavy Russian bombardment. And Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet detention after trying to emigrate to Israel, has been one of the most vocal critics of the Israeli government’s Ukraine policy.But while Mr. Sharansky opposes the government’s approach to Russia, he said its position had “absolutely nothing” to do with the influence of Russian-Israeli oligarchs.“I don’t think the people who are making decisions really know about the fact that this channel is owned by this one or this channel by that one,” said Mr. Sharansky, a former Israeli deputy prime minister.Live Updates: Russia-Ukraine WarUpdated April 24, 2022, 3:45 a.m. ETFar from their families, Ukrainian soldiers celebrate Easter.Here are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine.Bombs in Kharkiv and a kiss of reassurance in Kyiv.“All the experts and ministers and the leaders of the state are explaining to me again and again that we have our challenge in Syria,” Mr. Sharansky added. “Unfortunately, the West gave the keys to the skies of Syria to Putin. And because of this we have no choice but to come to a strategic understanding with him.”Analysts say that prominent Russian Israelis do have broader social capital that grants them access to opinion makers and decision takers. But they wield that influence in ways that are not particularly direct, tangible or quantifiable.“They are within this ecosystem of wealth, politics and media,” said Vera Michlin-Shapir, an expert on Russia and Israel at King’s College London and a former official of Israel’s National Security Council.ImageAn Israeli field hospital last month in Mostyska, Ukraine.

Mr. Mirilashvili’s father, Mikhael Mirilashvili, still has considerable energy and real estate investments in Russia and employed Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, now an oligarch close to Mr. Putin, as a manager in one of his restaurants during the 1990s.Len Blavatnik, a dual American-British citizen who made his fortune in Russia, is a major shareholder of Channel 13, one of Israel’s two leading private television outlets.Viktor F. Vekselberg, a Russian-Israeli businessman who has had sanctions imposed on him by the United States, once funded a spyware firm headed by Benny Gantz, now Israel’s defense minister. The firm folded after the United States punished Mr. Vekselberg in 2018.Since becoming an Israeli citizen in 2018, Mr. Abramovich has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli groups, including a major hospital, a university and a settler organization. And that philanthropy has won him favor: Recently, several leading Israelis, including recipients of his money, wrote to the American ambassador in Jerusalem to request that Washington spare Mr. Abramovich from sanctions.Mr. Liberman, the finance minister, has long used his platform to deflect criticism of Mr. Putin. In 2011, while foreign minister, he praised Russian parliamentary elections as free and democratic, despite widespread international concerns about their fairness. After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, he argued against joining American sanctions on Russia.Over time, that kind of intervention has inevitably had an effect on some Israelis and even on colleagues in government, Mr. Nevzlin said. Without it, perhaps the government’s “rhetoric would have been more clear, and the support and help to Ukraine would have been more prominent,” he added.ImageRoman Abramovich in 2006 in Jerusalem’s Old City. Since becoming an Israeli citizen in 2018, he has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli groups.Credit...Ronen Zvulun/ReutersIn general, Soviet-born Jewish oligarchs generally have a warmer reception in Israel than in some other countries because their Jewish heritage means they are not necessarily considered outsiders, said Mitchell Barak, an Israeli analyst who conducts public opinion research in both Israel and Russia.“The oligarchs feel a real connection to Israel, historically, culturally and religiously,” Mr. Barak said. “They also feel physically safe here,” and their philanthropy affords them “access and acceptance among all segments of Israeli society.”But the prominence of Russian-speaking businessmen does not empower them to tell Israeli politicians to “listen to the Kremlin,” Dr. Michlin-Shapir said. It simply gives them a platform to argue that “there are different sides to the story, ‘Let’s listen to all sides, let’s wait and see what the Russians have to say about this,’” she said.The Israeli government has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian Israelis linked to Mr. Putin, despite frequent requests from Ukrainian and some American officials. But Israel has nevertheless signaled that it does not want to become a hub for laundered Russian money.The Israeli Foreign Ministry publicly warned its embassies this week not to accept donations from individuals facing sanctions. Israeli officials say that Israeli banks are aware of the penalties they may incur from American authorities if they process money from those individuals.And Israel has banned foreign-registered yachts and planes from staying in Israel for more than 48 hours — a measure aimed at deterring Russian oligarchs from relocating to Israel.“Israel will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries,” Mr. Lapid, the foreign minister, said in March.ImageProjections of the national flags of Russia and Ukraine on the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City in March.Credit...Ammar Awad/ReutersRussian-speaking Israeli businessmen also are not necessarily any wealthier than immigrants from other national backgrounds. Of those named in a recent list of the 100 richest Israelis, published in Forbes magazine, only 10 were from post-Soviet origins — proportionally less than the size of the Russian-speaking population in Israel.Most major foreign donors to leading Israeli institutions are still from North America and Western Europe. And Yad Vashem recently refused to take Mr. Abramovich’s money, suspending a planned donation worth tens of millions of dollars after Mr. Abramovich was penalized by Britain.Perhaps most tellingly, Russian-owned news media outlets in Israel have not taken a pro-Kremlin position, and two Russian-language news websites were even blocked by Moscow in March because of their coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.In fact, it would be “absolutely impossible” for a Russian-Israeli media executive to push journalists to take a pro-Kremlin line, said Mr. Nevzlin, the billionaire Putin critic.The executives would face both a local and an international backlash at a time when they are seeking to keep a lower profile, he added.“There would probably be sanctions imposed on them,” Mr. Nevzlin said. “Why would rational people do something like that?”Reporting was contributed by Gabby Sobelman from Rehovot, Israel; Myra Noveck and Jonathan Rosen from Jerusalem; and Carol Sutherland from Moshav Ben Ami, Israel.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/world/middleeast/israel-ukraine-russia-oligarchs.html

In Brussels on Thursday, Biden pledged $1 billion in U.S. humanitarian assistance to refugees fleeing the invasion and hinted that he may meet with some of them. In the Polish city of Rzeszów, Biden will receive a briefing on the response to the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and the response to the flow of refugees fleeing the country. Afterward, he will meet with U.S. services members in the 82nd Airborne Division who have been deployed to Poland in recent weeks to help bolster NATO’s eastern flank. Biden will close the day by heading to Warsaw, where on Saturday he will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda.

The girls were students at Tishomingo High School and were on a lunch break at the time of the accident, according to district Superintendent Bobby Waitman. Those who died included the 16-year-old driver, three 15-year-olds and two 17-year-old passengers, the patrol said. Their names were not released because they are juveniles. The six girls were in a 2015 Chevrolet Spark that is designed to carry four passengers and only two of the six were wearing seat belts, according to a report by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The car also reportedly failed to come to a full stop before entering an intersection where it was hit by the truck that was hauling rocks, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. By the time Friday is over, we'll be down to the Elite Eight in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. The slate begins with the field’s last true Cinderella in action: Saint Peter's of the MAAC has a chance to do what no other No. 15 seed has done and reach the regional final. But they will need to beat No. 3 Purdue, a former No. 1 team in the nation, which has a great chance to reach the Final Four for the first time since 1980 (7:09 p.m. ET, CBS). Also in the East Region, traditional college basketball stalwarts will face off when No. 4 seed UCLA takes on No. 8 North Carolina (9:39 p.m. ET, CBS). Both games will be played in Philadelphia.  In the Midwest Region in Chicago, No. 4 Providence meets the only No. 1 seed remaining in Kansas (7:29 p.m. ET, TBS). The last game of the night will see two surprising teams match up when No. 11 Iowa State faces No. 10 Miami (9:59 p.m. ET, TBS).    Head to our men's and women's college basketball pages for more on the Friday matchups. Prince William and his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, arrived in the Bahamas Thursday for the final leg of their weeklong trip to Central America and the Caribbean designed to strengthen Britain's ties with Commonwealth nations as Queen Elizabeth II marks 70 years on the throne. The royal couple are scheduled to take part in several events and attend a dinner featuring community leaders Friday. William also will give a speech at the dinner. But protests have clouded the royal couple's three-nation visit and that will continue Friday when a demonstration will be held by Rastafarian groups in the Bahamas demanding reparation payments by Great Britain and an apology from the monarchy for its role in the slave trade. Local opposition also forced the couple to cancel a visit to a cacao farm in Belize and the Jamaica trip angered some. William expressed his ""profound sorrow"" for slavery during a speech Wednesday in Jamaica, though he stopped short of offering the apology protesters demanded. Dear readers, Lady Whistledown returned to your Netflix queue Friday with the much anticipated Season 2. Netflix's addictive romantic drama, set in 19th century Regency era England and produced by Shonda Rhimes, lit the streaming service on fire when it premiered on Christmas in 2020.. Mirroring Julia Quinn's books, this sophomore outing focuses on eldest Bridgerton sibling Anthony (Jonathan Bailey) and his quest for a wife. ""The main narrative arc of this season is this question of head versus heart, or duty versus love, and which one wins,"" says creator Chris Van Dusen. In her ★★★ (out of four) review, TV critic Kelly Lawler says that thanks to Anthony's ""electric love interest, Lady Whistledown, drama and the continued excellence of the cast, 'Bridgerton' has a strong sophomore season that should keep its fans happy, even if they might wonder where all the sex scenes went.""   Contributing: The Associated Press"

More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the start of Russia’s invasion of their country, and Biden will meet with Ukrainian refugees and American humanitarian workers Saturday in Warsaw, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. “The suffering that's taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden said in remarks at Poland's Rzeszów–Jasionka Airport. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your life and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.” Polish President Andrzej Duda and other U.S. and international officials also attended. Duda thanked Biden for visiting Rzeszów, which has seen some of the largest influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Biden said he was disappointed that he would be unable to go to Ukraine to see firsthand what is happening in the country. Biden on Thursday pledged $1 billion in U.S. humanitarian assistance to refugees fleeing the invasion. “It’s just devastating to see those little babies, little children, looking at mothers who you don't have to understand the language they speak. You see in their eyes the pain,” Biden said. “I don't think there's anything worse for a parent than to see a child suffering, their child suffering.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces continue to mount fierce, effective resistance around the country with indications that they have pushed back Russian forces near some cities. Near Kyiv, Russian troops have dug into defensive positions and heavy fighting is happening just northwest of the city, a senior Defense official said Friday.  The Russians have largely turned their focus of ground troops and airstrikes on eastern Ukraine, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The shift, which the Kremlin appeared to confirm, could signal an important narrowing of Moscow's military objectives as Russian forces appeared to have halted, at least for now, in their ground offensive in capturing Kiev, the country's capital.  Heavy fighting is now occurring in the Donbas region, where Russian-backed forces have fought with Ukrainians since 2014.  Col.-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation — reducing Ukraine's fighting capacity — has ""generally been accomplished,” allowing Russian forces to focus on “the main goal, liberation of Donbas.” The seeming shift in Moscow’s stated war aims — after weeks in which Vladimir Putin denied Ukraine’s right to exist as an sovereign country and appeared bent on capturing many of its cities and toppling its government — could point to a possible exit strategy for Russia, which has suffered fiercer resistance and heavier losses than anticipated.

Latest developments ►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount. ►A Minnesota native who was living in Ukraine and was ""unjustly"" detained by Russian forces about two weeks ago has been released and reunited with his wife and child, according to Minnesota Sen.

WAR'S IMPACT ON FOOD:How Russia's war against Ukraine could make our food prices – from bread to beer – more expensive Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace. In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.” Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol. Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city. About 300 people were killed in the Russian airstrike last week on a Mariupol theater that was being used as a shelter, Ukrainian authorities said Friday in what would make it the war’s deadliest known attack on civilians yet. For days, the government in the besieged and ruined port city was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of people were said to be taking cover, the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside to ward off aerial attack. In announcing the death toll on its Telegram channel Friday, the city government cited eyewitnesses. But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins. The scale of devastation in Mariupol, where bodies have been left unburied amid bomb craters and hollowed-out buildings, has made information difficult to obtain. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday. The attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea. Russian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles. Russia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets. – Tom Vanden Brook President Joe Biden used his first stop in Poland on Friday to personally thank U.S. troops stationed near the border of Ukraine. “You are the finest fighting force in the history of the world, and that’s not hyperbole,” Biden said during a visit with members of the 82nd Airborne Division in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine. Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in Poland to help shore up NATO’s eastern flank amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Minutes after landing in Poland, Biden stopped by a barbershop where around a dozen service members sat in folding chairs awaiting haircuts and others were getting a cut. He shook hands with several soldiers and joked about their closely shorn hair. “You are an amazing group of women and men,” Biden said. “I just want to thank you for your service. As your commander in chief, I meant it from the bottom of my heart.” – Michael Collins The United States and the European Union announced a new task force Friday that aims to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. “Putin has issued Russia's energy resources to coerce and manipulate his neighbors. He's using the profits to drive his war machine,” President Joe Biden said following a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Biden said the task force will focus on two initiatives: helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible and reducing Europe's demand for gas overall. Biden, on Friday, also announced a plan where the U.S. a few like-minded partners will increase exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year. Those exports would triple in the years afterward, a necessary move if the EU can back up its claim to be rid of Russian imports in five years. It will take huge investments, and getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult. U.S. export facilities are already operating at capacity, and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages. Most U.S. shipments already go to Europe. Even if more gas can be shipped to Europe, the continent may struggle to receive it. Import terminals are in coastal areas, and Europe’s pipeline system doesn’t have all the connections needed to send the natural gas throughout the continent. The moves come weeks after the United States announced a ban on all Russian energy imports. At the time, Biden said he made the decision in consultation with European allies and would create a long term plan with them. “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have a cost for Europe,” Biden said. “But it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.” — Rebecca Morin Russian shelling in Slavutych, a town near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant where many of its workers live, threatens the ability of the staff at the plant to rotate safely, an international nuclear watchdog said Thursday. International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement Ukrainian personnel had informed the agency of the Russian attacks that threatened the Chernobyl plant's operational staff, their families and homes. The staff was able to rotate out for a shift change recently after four weeks, Grossi said, but the shelling poses concerns. Russian forces took control of the plant early on in their invasion of Ukraine, raising worries about the safety of nuclear operations at the site.  NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday the use of nuclear or chemical weapons in Ukraine would ""totally change the nature of the war in Ukraine. It will be absolutely unacceptable."" Stoltenberg made the comments during a visit to a Cold Response drill, which occurs every two years and brings together NATO members and non-NATO members including Finland and Sweden. Russia declined to participate, but Stoltenberg said NATO ""always invite other countries to observe."" Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a meeting Friday that Russia was facing a ""total war declared on us"" as the West seeks to ""to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole."" In an evening address to Ukraine late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of hope and determination as the war headed into its second month.  “It is already night. But we are working,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. “The country must move toward peace, move forward. With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much. We are getting closer to victory. … We can’t stop even for a minute. Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy called on people worldwide to gather in public to show support for his embattled country. “Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,” he said.  Russian troops are purposefully targeting food stores in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, a local government official said.  In an audio message to The Associated Press, city council secretary Olexander Lomako said a ""catastrophe"" is unfolding in the northern city. Lomako added that a Russian airstrike destroyed a bridge over the Desna River this week, a key route for bringing in food and other supplies from Ukraine-controlled territory further south. “Humanitarian help, medicines and food used to be delivered into the city via this bridge,” he told The Associated Press. Less than half of the residents, around 130,000, are left in the city from the pre-war population of 285,000, Lomako said.  — Celina Tebor A majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.  The poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been ""too tough,"" the poll shows.  Across the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.  — Christal Hayes Contributing: The Associated Press"

The move is part of the country's bid to decrease the use of the euro and dollar and substitute it with its own ruble and national currencies of its ally countries such as China and Turkey.  The committee leader, Pavel Zavalny, made the televised announcement, saying the decision was made as a reaction to the sanctions that Russia is facing due to the war on Ukraine. Zalvany indicated that Western countries still importing oil and gas from Russia will have to pay rubles or gold. This also includes European countries that are not allied with Russia. Zalvany's comments were a proposal and are not a confirmed action.  ""The set of currencies may vary, and that’s normal practice. If there are bitcoins – we will trade in bitcoins,"" said Zalvany. $120 million and counting:How the 'first crypto war' is unfolding in Ukraine Tracking oligarchs:Americans can get $5 million for informing on Russian oligarchs' assets Sanctions:US and allies look to seize Russian oligarchs' megayachts Ukraine:Harris says high inflation, gas prices are ‘price to pay’ as US sanctions Russia The announcement resulted in climbing gas prices in Europe as buyersaround the world have opted out of consuming Russian oil as a way to sanction the country.  Zalvany said that all the contracts they have will still be in place, and nothing changes in their obligations. However, if they do not pay with the accepted currency, then Russia will not supply oil.  “Gas is just the beginning, this will also affect other resources. If they want to buy, let them pay either in hard currency, for us that’s gold, or in currencies that are convenient for us, that’s the national currency,” Zalvany said. "

Taylor Wilson: Good morning, I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 25th of March 2022. Today, a look at Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's legal interpretations, plus a look at Russian disinformation, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Four days of intense and at times emotional hearings to consider Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court are in the books, but a fundamental question remains open for debate. What kind of justice would she be? Supreme Court correspondent John Fritze has more. John Fritze: I think the first thing to keep in mind is that it's unlikely she upsets the 6-3 conservative advantage on the court. The most likely scenario here is that Judge Jackson, in these big cases that deal with political power or hot button issues, Jackson will likely be voting with the other two, we call them liberal justices, they would reject that label, but voting on the liberal wing. There's this slightly more wonky debate that you saw recurring throughout the hearings about judicial philosophy, and that gets into this idea of how do they view the constitution? As conservatives will know, the Constitution doesn't include the word abortion. So why is there a constitutional right to abortion? Well, because different judicial philosophies will read things into the constitution differently and conservatives embrace this idea of originalism which means that you look at the words of the Constitution as the Founding Fathers would've viewed those words. Then there's other philosophies. There's a thing called pragmatism, which is you take other things into account like fairness and intention of congress and their framers and so forth. Republicans really wanted to pin Jackson down on where she was and like a lot of nominees from Democratic presidents, she wasn't willing to be pinned down. So really what it comes down to is, is that enough to bother Republicans to not vote for her? I'm not sure, but it's certainly a little bit of an open debate about the big picture philosophy she'll take to looking at the constitution. I think the biggest takeaway from these hearings is that Jackson's very likely to be confirmed. You saw Republicans, even some of her toughest critics, saying things like, ""When you get on the court."" So I think that there's a broad acknowledgment that pending some dramatic surprise, she got through these hearings in pretty good shape. She got a lot of really tough questions. I think even the Republicans who were attacking her, some legitimate criticism about some of these issues, even they were saying, ""Look, you've been as forthright as you can be."" So I think that in some ways the votes on these nominees are baked-in now to the process. The last several nominees, the party of the President will vote pretty much in lockstep and you might pick up three or four senators from the other party. I think that was the calculation heading into this hearing. I don't think anything Jackson did changed that. It could have gone worse, right? She could have done something to upset that balance, she didn't. She didn't make any major mistakes. I think she gave a lot of people a lot of things to think about, but in the end analysis, I think that the status quo was maintained by her four days, pretty grueling days of questioning. Check out John's full piece in today's episode description. Ukraine is accusing Russia of forcibly removing hundreds of thousands of civilians from Ukraine to Russia. Ukrainian officials estimated that more than 400,000 people including 84,000 children, had been taken against their will into Russia. The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers but said they were from predominantly Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, and that most wanted to go to Russia. Meanwhile, at an emergency NATO summit in Brussels yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Western allies by video for air defense systems and other weapons. And in a video addressed to EU leaders, he thanked them for working together to impose stiff sanctions on Russia, but he said he wished those steps were taken earlier so that, as he put it, Russia may have thought twice about invading. The West still seems hesitant to give Zelenskyy everything he wants out of fears of sparking a broader war, but President Joe Biden who's in Europe this week said that more aid is on the way. He also praised NATO's unity amid the war in Ukraine. President Joe Biden: Putin was banking on NATO being split. In my earlier conversation with him in December and early January, it was clear to me he didn't think we could sustain this cohesion. NATO has never, never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine. We built that same unity with the European Union and with the leading democracies of the G7. Inside Ukraine, there are worries of a growing humanitarian crisis in Chernihiv in north-central Ukraine near the border with Belarus. A Russian airstrike destroyed a crucial bridge there this week and city officials say Russian forces are targeting food storage places. About 130,000 people are estimated left in the city, about half its pre-war population. In Belarus, pro-Moscow leader, Alexander Lukashenko, warned that a proposal by Poland to deploy a Western peacekeeping force in Ukraine will mean World War III. Elsewhere in Russia, Moscow is sending signals that Western sanctions have not completely brought it to its knees. The country has reopened its stock market but is only allowing limited trading to prevent mass selloffs. Foreigners have been banned from selling and traders were prohibited from short selling. Disinformation is a critical part of Russian military doctrine and has been since the Soviet era. National Correspondent Jessica Guynn, says that a group calling themselves cyber elves is going after Russian trolls on social media to fight their misinformation. Jessica Guynn: There was a group of folks in Lithuania in 2014, at the time of the uprising and invasion, who spotted a bunch of Facebook groups that had the same administrators and the same Russian talking points. And they realized that this was Kremlin propelled propaganda and disinformation designed to boost support for the war, and they saw that it was effective. So they decided to form a group of ordinary citizens who come together and hunt for these Russian efforts and disclose them and expose them to the world. And because they were hunting Russian trolls, they decided to call themselves elves. They started in Lithuania and then they spread to 13 other countries in Europe. I spoke with an elf in the Czech Republic, for example. That chapter was created in 2018, and there they use very highly-skilled professionals who know what they're doing to analyze disinformation, try to determine where it's coming from, combat it. They also produce reports that are often shared with intelligence officials in the government or with journalists. So they're a fairly sophisticated operation. They are definitely on the Kremlin's radar. I talked to the Czech elf yesterday and she told me that they had a DDoS attack on their website and they must keep their identities anonymous, except for their spokespeople because they could be in danger from Russian forces. Prince William and Duchess Kate are in the Bahamas today for the final leg of their week-long trip to Central America and the Caribbean. The trip has been designed to strengthen relations with the so-called Commonwealth Nations, countries that were once territories of the British Empire and remain politically associated. It comes as Queen Elizabeth II marks 70 years on the throne. But protests have clouded the visits. Demonstrations in Kingston came after well-known Jamaican leaders demanded in a letter that Britain pay reparations for slavery to its former colony. Demonstrator, Staceyann Chin said that many Jamaicans want to move past ties to the monarchy. Staceyann Chin: They shouldn't be welcomed as leaders of the country, as representatives of the head of state. How are these two young white people now going to be here saying we are going to kowtow to them and we are going to bend and bow and kneel to them as if they are gods. Those days are done. The monarchy is a relic. We should leave it behind. It's time for us to move forward and talk about the democratic process. The Royal couple are scheduled for a dinner with community leaders in the Bahamas tonight. Another demonstration will be held by Rastafarian groups demanding reparations. Local opposition also forced the couple to cancel a visit to a cacao farm in Belize. William expressed his profound sorrow for slavery this week, but he stopped short of offering the official apology that many protestors demanded. The United States men's national soccer team tied Mexico last night 0-0 in Mexico City. The stars and stripes managed the result without several key players, namely Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, and Brenden Aaronson. But they welcomed back teenage midfielder, Giovanni Reyna, who dazzled with a number of runs after coming on as a substitute following missed time because of injury. The son of former US great Claudio Reyna had not played a qualifier for the US in September because of hamstring problems. The United States only had 37% possession last night but outshot Mexico on target 4-2. The US missed huge chances though, with both Christian Pulisic and Jordan Pefok, unable to score right in front of goal. As for the atmosphere last night, it wasn't a typical game at Mexico's Estadio Azteca. The stadium officially seats 87,000 but has regularly packed in more than a 100,000 people at times. Last night, though, that number was estimated closer to 20 or 30,000. Capacity was cut as part of crowd control measures in response to fans continuing to use homophobic chants at games, but the actual attendance was even far below that capacity limit. After recent violence left fans dead at a Liga MX game, fans were getting scanned for facial recognition at the gates, something that may have kept thousands from deciding to enter the stadium, according to Sporting News. The atmosphere was so bizarre that at various points, the visiting, chanting US fans made the most noise inside Azteca. Ahead of the final two games, the US is tied with Mexico, but ahead on goal difference in second place. They'll need top three to avoid an intercontinental playoff to qualify for the World Cup. Next up, Panama on Sunday in Orlando. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us wherever you're listening right now, seven mornings a week.

For the latest news, see our latest live updates story. In a sweeping and forceful speech concluding a four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden cast the war in Ukraine on Saturday as part of an ongoing battle for freedom and ended with a blunt call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be stopped. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland, in his strongest comments to date about his desire to see Putin gone. Shortly after the speech, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Biden was not calling for Putin to be removed from office. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that “it’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.” “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Peskov said.  Biden's speech was delivered hours after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda during a historic visit Saturday where the allies presented a united front against Russian aggression and reaffirmed their commitment to the NATO alliance. Biden later met with Ukrainian refugees, including children who asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.” Biden's visit comes as Moscow appears to be recalibrating its military strategies in Ukraine, even as several media outlets reported a Russian missile struck a fuel depot in the western Ukraine city of Lviv which has largely escaped the devastation other parts of the nation have suffered. Russia's military goals in Ukraine have been hazy since it began its invasion more than a month ago, and new statements suggest Moscow may consider claiming victory without completely overthrowing the Ukrainian government or capturing Kyiv.  Western analysts and leaders were skeptical of the Friday statements, where the deputy chief of the Russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the ""main objectives"" of a first phase of the conflict. The power of the Ukrainian military has been  ""considerably reduced,"" freeing up troops to ""focus on the main efforts to achieve the main goal, liberation of Donbas,"" said Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi. The implications of the statement are difficult to determine, according to Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Special Subscription Offers ""It's plausible that they’re basically trying to ratchet their perceived war aims down to something they’ve already accomplished,"" he said. Before the invasion, portions of the Donbas in southeastern Ukraine were already controlled by Russian-backed forces. Similarly skeptical, French President Emmanuel Macron said “it’s too soon to say” whether the Russians have changed their approach. But what does appear clear: In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, the progress of Russian forces has largely stalled. Kyiv — while battered — remains under the control of the Ukrainian government.

WAR'S IMPACT ON FOOD:How Russia's war against Ukraine could make our foodprices – from bread to beer – more expensive Latest developments ►In remarks from Warsaw, President Joe Biden slammed Russian President Vladimir  Putin as a ""butcher"" for the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and said the West ""has never been stronger."" Poland has been on the front lines of the refugee crisis, having accepted some 2 million Ukrainians fleeing the war. ►Several media outlets reported that the western city of Lviv, largely spared from the bombardments in other parts of the nation was struck by a Russian missile Saturday. The mayor of the city says one of the targets was a fuel depot. ►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount. ► The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych in northern Ukraine and seized a hospital there. ► Britain has seized two jet aircraft belonging to Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler as Western governments put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by targeting the luxury lifestyles of his closest supporters. The Times of London described the aircraft as a $45 million Bombardier Global 6500 and a $13 million Cessna Citation Latitude. LVIV, Ukraine — The governor of the Lviv region says a man was detained on suspicion of espionage at the site of one of the two rocket attacks that rattled the city on Saturday. Maksym Kozytskyy said police found the man had recorded a rocket flying toward the target and striking it. Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers. Rockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv’s outskirts hours after the attacks.  — Associated Press After four days of alliance building, emotional interactions with refugees and stirring words about the need to fight for democracy, one sentence that President Joe Biden appeared to tack on to the end of his final speech in Poland threatened to overshadow all he had achieved as he deals with the most significant foreign policy crisis of his presidency. “For God’s sake,” Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, “this man cannot remain in power.” The White House tried to quickly walk it back. Biden was not promoting regime change, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The point the president was trying to make in his remarks was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”  Biden may have been saying what he believes, but it was not smart policy to say it aloud, said Tom Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign relations at Vanderbilt University. Read more here.  A spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was ""extremely negative"" for U.S. relations with Russia. “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.” The White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, claiming the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region."" Peskov said that with Biden's statements, he was ""narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration."" The U.S. will give Ukraine an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance, the State Department announced Saturday. The funding will help pay for field gear, medical supplies, armored vehicles and other equipment for Ukraine’s police and border guards. Ukrainian law enforcement officers are playing a key role in rescuing civilians, protecting convoys of fleeing refugees and providing security to civilian areas torn apart by Russia’s invasion, according to the State Department. The administration repeated past warnings that it is helping document war crimes so those responsible can be held accountable. – Maureen Groppe President Joe Biden said he arrived in Europe with a message for NATO, the European Union and all freedom-loving nations: “We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.” “We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,” he said. “It will not be easy. There will be cost, but it’s a price we have to pay Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty.” – Michael Collins Biden appealed to ordinary Russians, first telling them – “if you’re able to listen” – that “you ... are not our enemy.” The president said what they experienced at the hands of invaders in World War II is exactly what is happening to Ukrainians by the Russian military. “These are not the actions of a great nation,” Biden said of the bombings of hospitals, schools and maternity wards. “This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.” Biden said Putin’s aggressions have cut his people off from the rest of the world and taken Russia back to the 19th century. But Biden promised that the United States “will stand with you and the brave people of Ukraine who want peace.” “For God’s sake,” Biden said at the end of his speech, Putin ""cannot remain in power."" President Joe Biden said Saturday the war in Ukraine has been “a strategic failure” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin thought Ukrainians would “roll over and not fight,” Biden said. “Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance,” he said. Russia’s actions have also strengthened NATO’s resolve instead of pulling the alliance apart, Biden said. “The west is now stronger, more united than it has ever been,” he said. Biden said the sanctions imposed on Russia are having an impact. “The ruble has almost immediately reduced to rubble,” he said. More:'It will be a lot harder on people.' How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians Russia’s economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years and will no longer be among the 20 largest, he predicted. That’s sapping Russia’s strength and ability to reject power, Biden continued. “It is Vladimir Putin who is to blame. Period,” he said. -- Maureen Groppe President Joe Biden warned Saturday that the battle for democracy did not end with the Cold War. “Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have lived all across the globe,” Biden said in remarks from the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. Today, Russia has “strangled” democracy, and Vladimir Putin has sought to do so elsewhere – not only in his homeland but by invalidating neighboring nations, Biden said. “Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the designs of autocracy,” he said. “Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.” Biden praised the brave resistance of Ukrainians and said he was there to deliver a message. “We stand with you. Period,” Biden said. Biden spoke in the packed courtyard of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland where American and Polish flags waved in the background. When the president said he suspected Ukrainians were in the audience, a cheer went up. Biden said Ukrainians’ resistance is part of a larger fight for essential democratic principles. Those principles, he said, have always been under siege and every generation has to had to fight democracy’s mortal foes. In remarks concluding his four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden stood on the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw on Saturday and recalled the words of Pope John Paul II: “Be not afraid.” The White House billed Biden’s speech as a major address in which he would address efforts of the free world to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine. “In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed,” Biden said. “This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.” – Michael Collins and Maureen Groppe LVIV, Ukraine — Air raid sirens sounded Saturday afternoon in the western city of Lviv, and governor of the region Maxym Kozytsky reported “three powerful explosions near Lviv” without giving details of what was hit. Footage shot by The Associated Press showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the city. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, tweeted that one of missiles struck an industrial area that include a fuel storage depot, but that there was no indication residences were hit. ""All emergency services are working on the location,"" he tweeted. ""Please stay in the shelters until the air alarm goes off."" Lviv, a city of over 700,000 roughly 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of Ukraine’s border with Poland, has been largely spared from major Russian attacks in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, the Russian forces fired missiles on a military training center near Lviv, which at the time was the most westward target, and killed 35 people. Since the beginning of the invasion, Lviv has become a safe harbor for some 200,000 displaced Ukrainians. The explosions Saturday came as U.S. President Joe Biden was wrapping up a visit to neighboring NATO ally Poland in which he told Poland’s president that “ your freedom is ours.” - Associated Press President Joe Biden got a glimpse of the human toll of the war in Ukraine on Saturday when he visited with a group of Ukrainian refugees whose resilience he said demonstrated “the depth and strength of the human spirit.” “They’re an amazing group of people,” he said. Biden mingled for several minutes with refugees and humanitarian officials who are providing assistance to them at a national stadium in Warsaw. The stadium serves as a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits. Biden stopped in a courtyard that is serving as a distribution site for the World Central Kitchen, the non-profit organization founded by Chef José Andrés. The group has set up a mobile kitchen and is providing hot meals to the refugees. Biden chatted briefly with Andrés before walking over to a corner where families were gathered around tables with plates of hamburgers, fries, sausages and other food. Wearing a face mask and accompanied by an interpreter, the president picked up a small girl wearing a pink jacket and held her in his arms for several minutes. “It’s so incredible to see all of those little children,” Biden told reporters. “You just want to hug them.” Biden said each of the children he spoke with asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.” “I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone,” said Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a veteran of the war in Iraq. “Every morning, you get up and you wonder. You just pray you don’t get that phone call.” Asked what his visit with the refugees made him think of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.” President Joe Biden sought Saturday to reassure Poland that the U.S. would come to its defense if it should come under attack by Russia in an escalation of the war in Ukraine. The U.S. considers its commitment to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “a sacred obligation,” Biden told Polish President Andrzej Duda during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw. “You can count on that,” Biden said. The U.S. has sent thousands of forces to Poland to shore up NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden visited with members of the 82nd Airborne Division on Friday during a stop in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine. In Warsaw, Biden and Duda sat across from each other at a long table beneath a crystal chandelier as the two leaders prepared to discuss the humanitarian crisis sparked by the month-old war. More than 2 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland to escape the war. Speaking in Polish, Duda said Biden’s visit strengthened the bond between the two countries. Russia’s invasion has created “a huge tragedy” for the Ukrainian people and “a great sense of threat” for the Polish people, Duda said. “We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces,” Duda said. Biden stressed that stability in Europe “is critically important to the United States” and said the most important criterion is that NATO stay “absolutely, completely, thoroughly united” and that there be “no separation in our points of view.” During a briefing at the Ukraine Media Center, Ukraine’s development minister said Russian forces have destroyed about 4,500 houses and almost 400 education institutions since the war began last month, according to the Ukrainian news outlet Pravda.  “These figures are growing every day, and perhaps every hour,” said Oleksiy Chernyshov, Ukraine’s minister of development of communities and territories, according to the report. “At this time, when we say the bombing is going on, people are dying, infrastructure is being destroyed.""   He added that about 100 factories and enterprises and 150 health care facilities were also destroyed and noted that not all damage can be assessed until the conflict has ceased. The price tag on the damage could reach “tens of billions” of dollars, he said.  - Ella Lee The European Council for Nuclear Research is suspending work in Belarus and Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Saturday the 23 member states of CERN Council agreed to halt all events in Russia and Belarus and all scientists in all scientific committees of institutions in Russia and Belarus. In the announcement Friday, the CERN Council said the restrictions were agreed upon and implemented in an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Earlier this month, the CERN Council condemned the military invasion and agreed not to engage in new collaborations with Russia. At the council's June session the group said they will consider more sanctions on Russia and Belarus. - Ana Faguy With pomp and fanfare, President Joe Biden arrived at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on Saturday for a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda on how allies are responding to the humanitarian crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine. Biden’s limousine pulled into the palace courtyard shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time. Duda greeted the president as he stepped out of the car. The two chatted briefly, shook hands with a line of dignitaries and then participated in a formal arrival ceremony that included the playing of each country’s national anthem and a military procession. Russian invaders fired on and damaged Drobytsky Yar, a Holocaust Memorial outside Kharkiv. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced the attack on the memorial, which first opened in 2002, via Twitter. ""The Nazis have returned,"" the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense tweeted. ""Exactly 80 years later."" The memorial was created in honor of the 16,000 people killed after Nazi troops invaded the town in 1941. -Ana Faguy Women make up 15% of Ukraine's military, with nearly 7,000 women serving in its Air Force alone, a top Ukrainian official said Saturday. Ukraine’s military has 250,000 active-duty troops. “Women are the heart of the resilience of local communities,” People’s Deputy Lesia Vasylenko said in a tweet. “Heroic mothers and their inspiring daughters. This is the (Ukrainian) resistance.” The figure is on par with other nations worldwide, many of which have significantly larger militaries.  About 16.5% of the active-duty U.S. military are women, according to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report. Some branches of the military are more gender diverse than others – roughly 21% of the Air Force is comprised of women compared to 9% of Marines – a 2021 Department of Defense report shows. About 11% of the United Kingdom Regular Armed Forces are women, according to a 2021 report. The Center for Strategic & International Studies calculated that roughly 4% of the Russian military was women in 2020. The percentage of women in the other reporting NATO nations’ militaries range from 0.3% (Turkey) to 20% (Hungary), a 2020 NATO report shows.  Ukraine's information protection agency on Friday said that, between March 15-22, Russia conducted 60 cyberattacks against the nation’s ""critical infrastructure and government organizations,” but that most were limited in impact. “The number of attacks is growing, but most of them are unsuccessful,” Viktor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Protection of Information, said in a March 23 briefing, according to the agency’s Telegram post. “Even those that are successful do not affect the operation of critical information infrastructure.” Zhora added that the current activity is less serious than the activity tracked by the agency earlier this year.  LVIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych and seized a hospital there. Slavutych is located north of Kyiv and west of Chernihiv, outside the exclusion zone that was established around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the 1986 disaster. It is home to workers at the Chernobyl site. Governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Saturday that the Russians also kidnapped the city’s mayor, but some media reported later in the day that the mayor was released swiftly. Neither claim could be verified independently . The governor said that residents of Slavutych took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion. “The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” Pavlyuk said. In the month since the Russian invasion began, 136 children have been killed. Reuters reported that 64 of the children were killed in the Kyiv region and 50 were killed in the Donetsk region. An additional 199 children have been wounded. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Thursday, the civilian death toll in Ukraine has exceeded 1,000 since the start of the war. A pair of top Ukrainian officials will be on hand in Warsaw Saturday when President Joe Biden delivers a speech on holding Russia accountable for its month-long war against Ukraine. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message on Twitter that he and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will attend the president’s address. Biden started the final day of his four-day trip to Europe by dropping by a meeting between Reznikov and Kuleba and their U.S. counterparts – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Reznikov tweeted a photo of the meeting – sans Biden – and said they were discussing “current issues & cooperation in political & defense directions.” “In the evening we’ll also be present at @POTUS speech on the Russian war against Ukraine,” Reznikov wrote. Biden will deliver his remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. More than 100,00 people left Ukraine Friday, the State Border Guard Service Ukraine said. Two-thirds of those who left crossed Ukraine's western borders with EU countries as well as Moldova. The State Border Guard Service estimated 45,000 left Friday night alone. Meanwhile, many men are returning to Ukraine to defend the country, the Ukrainian government said. 21,000 people arrived in Ukraine Friday night. The State Border Guard Service said more than 420,000 Ukrainians have returned since Russia first invaded. The United Nations estimates that 10 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began last month. Friday's flow of refugees was significantly higher than in recent days. On Wednesday, about 43,000 fled and around 62,000 fled Thursday, according to government figures. DOHA, Qatar — Ukraine's president made a surprise video appearance Saturday at Qatar's Doha Forum, calling on the energy-rich nation and others to boost their production to counteract the loss of Russian energy supplies. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world since the start of the war Feb. 24. He compared Russia's destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war. ""They are destroying our ports,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide."" The loss of Ukrainian wheat already has worried Mideast nations like Egypt, which relies on those exports. Zelenskyy called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas. Zelenskyy criticized Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons, raising the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons being used on the battlefield. ""Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,"" Zelenskyy said. He also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan. ""We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,"" he said. – Associated Press President Joe Biden on Saturday will cap his European trip talking to Ukrainian refugees in Poland and delivering a speech on holding Russia accountable for its invasion and upholding democratic values. Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, previewed Biden’s remarks as a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.” Biden will also put the war in historical context and describe where he sees it going from here, Sullivan said. Before delivering those remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Presidential Palace “The suffering that is taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden told Duda on Friday at a meeting in Rzeszów, where the influx of refugees is the largest. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your lives and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.” On Thursday, Biden announced the U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainians and provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance. Poland has taken in more than 2 million refugees, and the numbers continue to grow. “We have never experienced anything like that throughout our history,” Duda told Biden. On Saturday, Biden will meet with refugees at the National Stadium in Warsaw. The stadium is a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits. “I'm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis,” Biden said Friday, expressing his disappointment that he can’t cross the border into Ukraine for security reasons. Biden has been in Europe since Wednesday, meeting with NATO allies and other European and world leaders.  The U.S. and its allies announced new sanctions on Russia, additional help for Ukraine, and discussed beefing up force presence in Eastern Europe in the near and longer-term. – Maureen Groppe LONDON — Britain's Defense Ministry says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. A daily update says Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralize defending forces. The assessment says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties. – Associated Press Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace. In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.” Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol. Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday. The attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea. Russian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles. Russia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets. – Tom Vanden Brook A majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.  The poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been ""too tough,"" the poll shows.  Across the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning of oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.  — Christal Hayes Contributing: The Associated Press"

For the latest news, see our latest live updates story. In a sweeping and forceful speech concluding a four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden cast the war in Ukraine on Saturday as part of an ongoing battle for freedom and ended with a blunt call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be stopped. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland, in his strongest comments to date about his desire to see Putin gone. Shortly after the speech, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Biden was not calling for Putin to be removed from office. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that “it’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.” “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Peskov said.  Biden's speech was delivered hours after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda during a historic visit Saturday where the allies presented a united front against Russian aggression and reaffirmed their commitment to the NATO alliance. Biden later met with Ukrainian refugees, including children who asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.” Biden's visit comes as Moscow appears to be recalibrating its military strategies in Ukraine, even as several media outlets reported a Russian missile struck a fuel depot in the western Ukraine city of Lviv which has largely escaped the devastation other parts of the nation have suffered. Russia's military goals in Ukraine have been hazy since it began its invasion more than a month ago, and new statements suggest Moscow may consider claiming victory without completely overthrowing the Ukrainian government or capturing Kyiv.  Western analysts and leaders were skeptical of the Friday statements, where the deputy chief of the Russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the ""main objectives"" of a first phase of the conflict. The power of the Ukrainian military has been  ""considerably reduced,"" freeing up troops to ""focus on the main efforts to achieve the main goal, liberation of Donbas,"" said Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi. The implications of the statement are difficult to determine, according to Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Special Subscription Offers ""It's plausible that they’re basically trying to ratchet their perceived war aims down to something they’ve already accomplished,"" he said. Before the invasion, portions of the Donbas in southeastern Ukraine were already controlled by Russian-backed forces. Similarly skeptical, French President Emmanuel Macron said “it’s too soon to say” whether the Russians have changed their approach. But what does appear clear: In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, the progress of Russian forces has largely stalled. Kyiv — while battered — remains under the control of the Ukrainian government.

WAR'S IMPACT ON FOOD:How Russia's war against Ukraine could make our foodprices – from bread to beer – more expensive Latest developments ►In remarks from Warsaw, President Joe Biden slammed Russian President Vladimir  Putin as a ""butcher"" for the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and said the West ""has never been stronger."" Poland has been on the front lines of the refugee crisis, having accepted some 2 million Ukrainians fleeing the war. ►Several media outlets reported that the western city of Lviv, largely spared from the bombardments in other parts of the nation was struck by a Russian missile Saturday. The mayor of the city says one of the targets was a fuel depot. ►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount. ► The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych in northern Ukraine and seized a hospital there. ► Britain has seized two jet aircraft belonging to Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler as Western governments put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by targeting the luxury lifestyles of his closest supporters. The Times of London described the aircraft as a $45 million Bombardier Global 6500 and a $13 million Cessna Citation Latitude. LVIV, Ukraine — The governor of the Lviv region says a man was detained on suspicion of espionage at the site of one of the two rocket attacks that rattled the city on Saturday. Maksym Kozytskyy said police found the man had recorded a rocket flying toward the target and striking it. Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers. Rockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv’s outskirts hours after the attacks.  — Associated Press After four days of alliance building, emotional interactions with refugees and stirring words about the need to fight for democracy, one sentence that President Joe Biden appeared to tack on to the end of his final speech in Poland threatened to overshadow all he had achieved as he deals with the most significant foreign policy crisis of his presidency. “For God’s sake,” Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, “this man cannot remain in power.” The White House tried to quickly walk it back. Biden was not promoting regime change, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The point the president was trying to make in his remarks was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”  Biden may have been saying what he believes, but it was not smart policy to say it aloud, said Tom Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign relations at Vanderbilt University. Read more here.  A spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was ""extremely negative"" for U.S. relations with Russia. “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.” The White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, claiming the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region."" Peskov said that with Biden's statements, he was ""narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration."" The U.S. will give Ukraine an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance, the State Department announced Saturday. The funding will help pay for field gear, medical supplies, armored vehicles and other equipment for Ukraine’s police and border guards. Ukrainian law enforcement officers are playing a key role in rescuing civilians, protecting convoys of fleeing refugees and providing security to civilian areas torn apart by Russia’s invasion, according to the State Department. The administration repeated past warnings that it is helping document war crimes so those responsible can be held accountable. – Maureen Groppe President Joe Biden said he arrived in Europe with a message for NATO, the European Union and all freedom-loving nations: “We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.” “We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,” he said. “It will not be easy. There will be cost, but it’s a price we have to pay Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty.” – Michael Collins Biden appealed to ordinary Russians, first telling them – “if you’re able to listen” – that “you ... are not our enemy.” The president said what they experienced at the hands of invaders in World War II is exactly what is happening to Ukrainians by the Russian military. “These are not the actions of a great nation,” Biden said of the bombings of hospitals, schools and maternity wards. “This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.” Biden said Putin’s aggressions have cut his people off from the rest of the world and taken Russia back to the 19th century. But Biden promised that the United States “will stand with you and the brave people of Ukraine who want peace.” “For God’s sake,” Biden said at the end of his speech, Putin ""cannot remain in power."" President Joe Biden said Saturday the war in Ukraine has been “a strategic failure” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin thought Ukrainians would “roll over and not fight,” Biden said. “Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance,” he said. Russia’s actions have also strengthened NATO’s resolve instead of pulling the alliance apart, Biden said. “The west is now stronger, more united than it has ever been,” he said. Biden said the sanctions imposed on Russia are having an impact. “The ruble has almost immediately reduced to rubble,” he said. More:'It will be a lot harder on people.' How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians Russia’s economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years and will no longer be among the 20 largest, he predicted. That’s sapping Russia’s strength and ability to reject power, Biden continued. “It is Vladimir Putin who is to blame. Period,” he said. -- Maureen Groppe President Joe Biden warned Saturday that the battle for democracy did not end with the Cold War. “Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have lived all across the globe,” Biden said in remarks from the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. Today, Russia has “strangled” democracy, and Vladimir Putin has sought to do so elsewhere – not only in his homeland but by invalidating neighboring nations, Biden said. “Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the designs of autocracy,” he said. “Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.” Biden praised the brave resistance of Ukrainians and said he was there to deliver a message. “We stand with you. Period,” Biden said. Biden spoke in the packed courtyard of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland where American and Polish flags waved in the background. When the president said he suspected Ukrainians were in the audience, a cheer went up. Biden said Ukrainians’ resistance is part of a larger fight for essential democratic principles. Those principles, he said, have always been under siege and every generation has to had to fight democracy’s mortal foes. In remarks concluding his four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden stood on the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw on Saturday and recalled the words of Pope John Paul II: “Be not afraid.” The White House billed Biden’s speech as a major address in which he would address efforts of the free world to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine. “In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed,” Biden said. “This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.” – Michael Collins and Maureen Groppe LVIV, Ukraine — Air raid sirens sounded Saturday afternoon in the western city of Lviv, and governor of the region Maxym Kozytsky reported “three powerful explosions near Lviv” without giving details of what was hit. Footage shot by The Associated Press showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the city. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, tweeted that one of missiles struck an industrial area that include a fuel storage depot, but that there was no indication residences were hit. ""All emergency services are working on the location,"" he tweeted. ""Please stay in the shelters until the air alarm goes off."" Lviv, a city of over 700,000 roughly 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of Ukraine’s border with Poland, has been largely spared from major Russian attacks in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, the Russian forces fired missiles on a military training center near Lviv, which at the time was the most westward target, and killed 35 people. Since the beginning of the invasion, Lviv has become a safe harbor for some 200,000 displaced Ukrainians. The explosions Saturday came as U.S. President Joe Biden was wrapping up a visit to neighboring NATO ally Poland in which he told Poland’s president that “ your freedom is ours.” - Associated Press President Joe Biden got a glimpse of the human toll of the war in Ukraine on Saturday when he visited with a group of Ukrainian refugees whose resilience he said demonstrated “the depth and strength of the human spirit.” “They’re an amazing group of people,” he said. Biden mingled for several minutes with refugees and humanitarian officials who are providing assistance to them at a national stadium in Warsaw. The stadium serves as a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits. Biden stopped in a courtyard that is serving as a distribution site for the World Central Kitchen, the non-profit organization founded by Chef José Andrés. The group has set up a mobile kitchen and is providing hot meals to the refugees. Biden chatted briefly with Andrés before walking over to a corner where families were gathered around tables with plates of hamburgers, fries, sausages and other food. Wearing a face mask and accompanied by an interpreter, the president picked up a small girl wearing a pink jacket and held her in his arms for several minutes. “It’s so incredible to see all of those little children,” Biden told reporters. “You just want to hug them.” Biden said each of the children he spoke with asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.” “I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone,” said Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a veteran of the war in Iraq. “Every morning, you get up and you wonder. You just pray you don’t get that phone call.” Asked what his visit with the refugees made him think of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.” President Joe Biden sought Saturday to reassure Poland that the U.S. would come to its defense if it should come under attack by Russia in an escalation of the war in Ukraine. The U.S. considers its commitment to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “a sacred obligation,” Biden told Polish President Andrzej Duda during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw. “You can count on that,” Biden said. The U.S. has sent thousands of forces to Poland to shore up NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden visited with members of the 82nd Airborne Division on Friday during a stop in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine. In Warsaw, Biden and Duda sat across from each other at a long table beneath a crystal chandelier as the two leaders prepared to discuss the humanitarian crisis sparked by the month-old war. More than 2 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland to escape the war. Speaking in Polish, Duda said Biden’s visit strengthened the bond between the two countries. Russia’s invasion has created “a huge tragedy” for the Ukrainian people and “a great sense of threat” for the Polish people, Duda said. “We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces,” Duda said. Biden stressed that stability in Europe “is critically important to the United States” and said the most important criterion is that NATO stay “absolutely, completely, thoroughly united” and that there be “no separation in our points of view.” During a briefing at the Ukraine Media Center, Ukraine’s development minister said Russian forces have destroyed about 4,500 houses and almost 400 education institutions since the war began last month, according to the Ukrainian news outlet Pravda.  “These figures are growing every day, and perhaps every hour,” said Oleksiy Chernyshov, Ukraine’s minister of development of communities and territories, according to the report. “At this time, when we say the bombing is going on, people are dying, infrastructure is being destroyed.""   He added that about 100 factories and enterprises and 150 health care facilities were also destroyed and noted that not all damage can be assessed until the conflict has ceased. The price tag on the damage could reach “tens of billions” of dollars, he said.  - Ella Lee The European Council for Nuclear Research is suspending work in Belarus and Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Saturday the 23 member states of CERN Council agreed to halt all events in Russia and Belarus and all scientists in all scientific committees of institutions in Russia and Belarus. In the announcement Friday, the CERN Council said the restrictions were agreed upon and implemented in an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Earlier this month, the CERN Council condemned the military invasion and agreed not to engage in new collaborations with Russia. At the council's June session the group said they will consider more sanctions on Russia and Belarus. - Ana Faguy With pomp and fanfare, President Joe Biden arrived at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on Saturday for a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda on how allies are responding to the humanitarian crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine. Biden’s limousine pulled into the palace courtyard shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time. Duda greeted the president as he stepped out of the car. The two chatted briefly, shook hands with a line of dignitaries and then participated in a formal arrival ceremony that included the playing of each country’s national anthem and a military procession. Russian invaders fired on and damaged Drobytsky Yar, a Holocaust Memorial outside Kharkiv. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced the attack on the memorial, which first opened in 2002, via Twitter. ""The Nazis have returned,"" the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense tweeted. ""Exactly 80 years later."" The memorial was created in honor of the 16,000 people killed after Nazi troops invaded the town in 1941. -Ana Faguy Women make up 15% of Ukraine's military, with nearly 7,000 women serving in its Air Force alone, a top Ukrainian official said Saturday. Ukraine’s military has 250,000 active-duty troops. “Women are the heart of the resilience of local communities,” People’s Deputy Lesia Vasylenko said in a tweet. “Heroic mothers and their inspiring daughters. This is the (Ukrainian) resistance.” The figure is on par with other nations worldwide, many of which have significantly larger militaries.  About 16.5% of the active-duty U.S. military are women, according to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report. Some branches of the military are more gender diverse than others – roughly 21% of the Air Force is comprised of women compared to 9% of Marines – a 2021 Department of Defense report shows. About 11% of the United Kingdom Regular Armed Forces are women, according to a 2021 report. The Center for Strategic & International Studies calculated that roughly 4% of the Russian military was women in 2020. The percentage of women in the other reporting NATO nations’ militaries range from 0.3% (Turkey) to 20% (Hungary), a 2020 NATO report shows.  Ukraine's information protection agency on Friday said that, between March 15-22, Russia conducted 60 cyberattacks against the nation’s ""critical infrastructure and government organizations,” but that most were limited in impact. “The number of attacks is growing, but most of them are unsuccessful,” Viktor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Protection of Information, said in a March 23 briefing, according to the agency’s Telegram post. “Even those that are successful do not affect the operation of critical information infrastructure.” Zhora added that the current activity is less serious than the activity tracked by the agency earlier this year.  LVIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych and seized a hospital there. Slavutych is located north of Kyiv and west of Chernihiv, outside the exclusion zone that was established around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the 1986 disaster. It is home to workers at the Chernobyl site. Governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Saturday that the Russians also kidnapped the city’s mayor, but some media reported later in the day that the mayor was released swiftly. Neither claim could be verified independently . The governor said that residents of Slavutych took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion. “The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” Pavlyuk said. In the month since the Russian invasion began, 136 children have been killed. Reuters reported that 64 of the children were killed in the Kyiv region and 50 were killed in the Donetsk region. An additional 199 children have been wounded. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Thursday, the civilian death toll in Ukraine has exceeded 1,000 since the start of the war. A pair of top Ukrainian officials will be on hand in Warsaw Saturday when President Joe Biden delivers a speech on holding Russia accountable for its month-long war against Ukraine. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message on Twitter that he and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will attend the president’s address. Biden started the final day of his four-day trip to Europe by dropping by a meeting between Reznikov and Kuleba and their U.S. counterparts – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Reznikov tweeted a photo of the meeting – sans Biden – and said they were discussing “current issues & cooperation in political & defense directions.” “In the evening we’ll also be present at @POTUS speech on the Russian war against Ukraine,” Reznikov wrote. Biden will deliver his remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. More than 100,00 people left Ukraine Friday, the State Border Guard Service Ukraine said. Two-thirds of those who left crossed Ukraine's western borders with EU countries as well as Moldova. The State Border Guard Service estimated 45,000 left Friday night alone. Meanwhile, many men are returning to Ukraine to defend the country, the Ukrainian government said. 21,000 people arrived in Ukraine Friday night. The State Border Guard Service said more than 420,000 Ukrainians have returned since Russia first invaded. The United Nations estimates that 10 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began last month. Friday's flow of refugees was significantly higher than in recent days. On Wednesday, about 43,000 fled and around 62,000 fled Thursday, according to government figures. DOHA, Qatar — Ukraine's president made a surprise video appearance Saturday at Qatar's Doha Forum, calling on the energy-rich nation and others to boost their production to counteract the loss of Russian energy supplies. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world since the start of the war Feb. 24. He compared Russia's destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war. ""They are destroying our ports,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide."" The loss of Ukrainian wheat already has worried Mideast nations like Egypt, which relies on those exports. Zelenskyy called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas. Zelenskyy criticized Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons, raising the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons being used on the battlefield. ""Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,"" Zelenskyy said. He also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan. ""We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,"" he said. – Associated Press President Joe Biden on Saturday will cap his European trip talking to Ukrainian refugees in Poland and delivering a speech on holding Russia accountable for its invasion and upholding democratic values. Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, previewed Biden’s remarks as a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.” Biden will also put the war in historical context and describe where he sees it going from here, Sullivan said. Before delivering those remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Presidential Palace “The suffering that is taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden told Duda on Friday at a meeting in Rzeszów, where the influx of refugees is the largest. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your lives and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.” On Thursday, Biden announced the U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainians and provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance. Poland has taken in more than 2 million refugees, and the numbers continue to grow. “We have never experienced anything like that throughout our history,” Duda told Biden. On Saturday, Biden will meet with refugees at the National Stadium in Warsaw. The stadium is a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits. “I'm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis,” Biden said Friday, expressing his disappointment that he can’t cross the border into Ukraine for security reasons. Biden has been in Europe since Wednesday, meeting with NATO allies and other European and world leaders.  The U.S. and its allies announced new sanctions on Russia, additional help for Ukraine, and discussed beefing up force presence in Eastern Europe in the near and longer-term. – Maureen Groppe LONDON — Britain's Defense Ministry says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol. A daily update says Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralize defending forces. The assessment says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties. – Associated Press Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace. In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.” Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol. Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday. The attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea. Russian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles. Russia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets. – Tom Vanden Brook A majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.  The poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been ""too tough,"" the poll shows.  Across the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning of oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.  — Christal Hayes Contributing: The Associated Press"

If you'd like to get The Backstory in your inbox every week, sign up here. When we talk about the goal of investigative journalism, we talk about holding the powerful accountable and being watchdogs for the vulnerable.  Two stories in the past two weeks did exactly that. Tuesday, the California State University's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to adopt a series of reforms in response to our reporting that revealed its chancellor mishandled six years of sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation complaints against then-Fresno State Vice President of Student Affairs Frank Lamas. Joseph Castro resigned as CSU chancellor on Feb. 17, two weeks after reporter Kenny Jacoby's investigation into his time as president of Fresno State sparked outrage and pressure from lawmakers, students, faculty and the public.  Jacoby reported that ""Castro repeatedly declined to discipline Lamas, even after an outside investigator found Lamas responsible in 2020 for sexually harassing an subordinate and engaging in 'abusive workplace conduct.' Instead, Castro authorized a settlement with Lamas that gave him $260,000 and a clean record in exchange for his retirement. Although the agreement banned Lamas from working at CSU again, it promised him a letter of recommendation from Castro to help him find work elsewhere."" Faigin started by saying, “I also want to maybe make a statement that's not going to be somewhat popular with some people in the system."" Then he said it anyway. It's extraordinary: ""We are here today, going through this catharsis and great change for the better because of a free press in America and specifically USA TODAY and Kenny Jacoby. Now, a lot of people have been offended that – I've been told that they don't like the idea that this guy is writing stories, exposing things and showing that there are negative things about the CSU. We would not have known about any of this stuff because ... all these facts were withheld from us. And obviously, we would have done something about it if we'd known. But we didn't.  ""But here comes USA TODAY, Kenny Jacoby, and six months of hard work, effort that's not easy. Believe me, investigative reporting is not easy. And he was able to develop that story. And look at all the changes that have occurred because of that. Of course, the LA Times, the Fresno Bee, and numerous others have taken it from there, and building on those known facts. But thank you, USA TODAY, for doing such a great job and showing us the way forward.  ""What I also think is so important out of this is the idea of what kind of danger America faces as media faces strong winds economically and institutionally against it. And how many papers and investigative reporting are going downhill because it's an expensive, difficult proposition. This alone is a great example of why we need a free press in America. I would hope that his stories and investigative reporting is up for journalism awards. And in a lot of journalism awards, it's not just how good the story is, how the exposé is there. But it is also a measure of what change the story brought about. And from this meeting today, I hope people realize we're changing. We recognize the problem. We're taking action. We're not going to put up with it until we find solutions all because of Kenny Jacoby and USA TODAY."" I asked Jacoby what he thought when he heard the remarks.  ""It was a heartwarming moment for me,"" he said. ""He certainly didn’t need to say those things – it’s clear not everyone at the CSU appreciated USA TODAY bringing these issues to light, and he even said he thought his statement would be unpopular with some at the CSU. ""I felt honored that he not only credited us for our reporting but used his platform to recognize the value of investigative journalism."" In a separate investigation, USA TODAY compiled data filed by more than 15,000 homes and, for the first time, published a report card on how each fared during a five-month surge of COVID-19 infections and deaths that started in October 2020. Reporters Letitia Stein, Jayme Fraser and Nick Penzenstadler and reporting partner Jeff Kelly Lowenstein analyzed the data and interviewed industry experts, government overseers, nursing home workers and families of the dead for the series. ""We had all the ingredients for strong investigative reporting,"" Stein said. ""Robust data, public documents such as health inspection reports to reveal errors that facilities may not otherwise disclose, and people who had suffered from corporate and regulatory failures. Reporters from across the USA TODAY Network helped us to collect their stories."" The team scored the performance of every nursing home in America during the worst COVID outbreak and created a searchable database that published March 10. The next day, the White House contacted our reporters. ""Health policy advisers to President Joe Biden cited a USA TODAY investigation into nursing home care during the pandemic as evidence of a troubled industry urgently in need of reform to crack down on poor performers and profiteering,"" Penzenstadler reported.  The topic was personal for Stein. Early in the pandemic, her 84-year-old father went from living independently at home to being bed bound in the span of a few weeks. ""My family at the time didn’t have a high-quality nursing home option,"" she said. ""Paramedics brought him home from the hospital in a stretcher, depositing him on a bed newly installed in the living room. A feeding tube was still in its box. It fell to me to coordinate for him at home the level of care that typically would be provided at a nursing home. I came to appreciate how nursing homes are essential infrastructure in a rapidly aging nation. ""We need these institutions to work."" Holding the powerful accountable. Looking out for the vulnerable. That's the power of investigative reporting.  “There is so much anger directed at journalists right now, most of it manufactured and unfair. But let me tell you, these reporters are still out there trying to uncover wrongs and trying to change people’s lives for the better,"" said Chris Davis, executive editor for investigations. ""At this moment, as much as at any other in our history, we need these investigative reporters. ""We need them to be fearless and interminable and to speak truth to power.” Backstory:A journalist and a refugee. How one reporter helps cover the war in Ukraine while living through the fallout.

As if the circumstances at the worlds in Montpellier, France, were not unusual enough already, Knierim and Frazier’s long program was delayed for several minutes when their U.S. teammate Ashley Cain-Gribble, skating with partner Timothy LeDuc, fell three times in the first two minutes of their program. Cain-Gribble hit her chin on the ice on the third fall and couldn’t get up as their music played on, laying and sitting on the ice for some time before she was taken off the ice on a stretcher.  U.S. Figure Skating said Cain-Gribble was taken to the hospital for “additional evaluation and observation.”  Cain-Gribble and LeDuc were in second place after the short program, in perfect position to win a medal before having to withdraw. They were the second-to-last skaters in the competition, followed only by Knierim and Frazier, the leaders after the short program who gave LeDuc a hug before they themselves took the ice. “It’s startling,” Knierim said afterward. “You realize how dangerous skating can be. Even when you are prepared, things can happen.” “Our hearts go out to (Cain-Gribble and LeDuc),” Frazier said. “They’re our friends first, competitors second, so we were naturally really concerned to see what was going on with them.”  Knierim and Frazier won the gold medal with ease, scoring 221.09 points, more than 20 points ahead of Japan’s Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara with 199.55 points and Canada’s Vanessa James and Eric Radford with 197.32. The gold medal was the first medal of any kind won by a U.S. pair at worlds in 20 years.  Knierim and Frazier, who missed the national championships in January when Frazier tested positive for COVID-19, finished sixth at the Beijing Olympics behind gold medalists Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China, Russian pairs in second, third and fourth place, and another Chinese pair in fifth.  The Russians subsequently were banned from the worlds, not because of the state-sponsored doping that produced the Kamila Valieva scandal in Beijing, but because of their nation’s invasion of Ukraine. China chose not to send its skaters to worlds.  So the world pairs title was there for the taking, and the Americans rose to the occasion, scoring personal bests in both their short and long programs. “I always dreamed but never actually thought it was possible,” Knierim said.  Added Frazier: “I couldn’t have asked for a better way to end the season. For Alexa and I this was such a personal journey since we started, so to finish the season on this kind of program that means so much to us dearly, I dreamed about this moment so many times but this was even better.” "

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., wrote, “Reject the New World Order. Embrace America First.” Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., tweeted, “There is no new world order coming on my watch.”   Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks  This flurry of references ignores the longstanding historical meaning of this phrase, however, giving a misleading impression of Biden's remarks. Biden did mention a ""new world order,"" but he was describing international changes from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, not confirming a world domination conspiracy theory. Historians say politicians have used the term in speeches for decades.  USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook pages that shared the posts for comment.  While ""new world order"" is connected to a long-standing anti-government conspiracy theory, experts say it’s common for politicians to use the term during global conflict and times of change, as Biden was doing. Biden invoked the phrase while discussing international changes in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Biden said the world's response to the Russian invasion presents “significant opportunities to make some real changes,” and the world is at an “inflection point” that occurs every three to four generations. Then he said this: ""And now is a time when things are shifting. We’re going to – there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it.  And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it."" Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said mentions of a new world order go back at least a century. It is typically used to describe a global situation after major events such as World Wars I and II. However, he said each time the phrase is used by a prominent figure, right-wing extremists have seized on the comments to suggest that they don’t want a peaceful nation but rather “a socialist one-world government” that would eliminate national borders, freedoms and liberty. He pointed to instances where the phrase was used decades ago by President George H.W. Bush after the end of the Cold War. In a March 1991 address to Congress on the Gulf War, Bush mentioned a new world order while directly quoting former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. ""Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order,"" Bush said. “In the words of Winston Churchill, a world order in which 'the principles of justice and fair play protect the weak against the strong.'"" Kathryn Olmsted, a professor of history at the University of California, Davis, said in an email that both Bush and Biden used the term in line with its historical meaning. “Both Biden and Bush used the term in essentially the same way: to indicate that the international community needed or needs to cooperate to stop aggression,” Olmsted said. Landon Firm, a professor of philosophy and religious studies at Florida Gulf Coast University, noted how Biden's speech mentioned the “world order” created after the end of World War II, which is often called the “liberal international order” “This was marked by the decline of traditional, overseas empires, especially in the British Empire, and the rise of the United States as a global superpower,” Firm said via email. He added, ""'International order' is nothing more than the general patterns which describe international relations during a given time period.”   Fact check: $1.5 trillion spending bill passed with bipartisan support in Congress Based on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that Biden said there is a “new world order,” because without additional details it could be misleading. Biden’s full speech shows he was discussing global changes in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. He was not confirming a one-world government conspiracy theory. Historians and experts say the term ""new world order"" has been used by politicians for decades to describe international changes during a new period of history.

It was China's first major airline crash since 2010, according to The New York Times.  A March 22 Facebook post captioned “#MU5735” purports to show an image of the plane barreling toward the ground without its tail. “As seen on close up footage of the crash, vertical stabilizer – tail – of aircraft had been detached (sic),” text on the image reads. The post accumulated more than 4,000 reactions and 1,600 shares in two days.  The tail section of the plane consists of the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, including the fin, rudder and elevators, which help to control the plane in flight. But the image in the claim does not show the China Eastern crash. Instead it's a frame from a documentary's animated simulation of a 1997 plane crash. The investigation into the cause of Flight MU5735's crash is continuing.  Fact check: Congress salaries unchanged by $1.5 trillion spending bill USA TODAY reached out to the user who posted the claim for comment.  The image is a screenshot from an animated simulation video that can be viewed on YouTube.  The clip is originally from a documentary about the crash of SilkAir Flight MI185,  which according to Singaporean database Infopedia crashed into a river in Indonesia while en route to Singapore in 1997. An investigation of Flight 185 showed that portions of the plane’s tail separated as it plunged downward due to its rapid descent. This is depicted in the simulation.  The plane in the image appears to be a different color than the China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed. In the post, what’s left of plane's tail appears turquoise, similar to the turquoise-and-navy design that adorned the planes of now-defunct SilkAir Airlines. The Boeing 737 that carried Flight MU5735, registered as China Eastern B-1791, was red, white and gold.  An investigation into the cause of Flight MU5735's crash is ongoing as of March 23.  Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, has said the investigation will be difficult due to the fact that the aircraft “was severely damaged in this accident,” according to The New York Times.  Fact check: Photo shows firefighters in Australia, not Ukraine Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that an image shows a China Eastern Airlines plane in a nosedive.

And NASA reports CO2 levels in Earth's atmosphere are the highest they've been in 800,000 years due to human activity. However, some social media users are sharing a blog post that claims a 1917 paper by physicist Albert Einstein contradicts the idea that CO2 could drive climate change. ""Albert Einstein says no to CO2 radiative warming of the atmosphere,"" reads the title of the blog post, shared Feb. 20 on Facebook. The article also spread on Facebook and Twitter in 2020 and 2021 before reemerging again last month. However, the claim is false. The Einstein quote in the blog is compatible with modern climate science, according to experts. It addresses the effect of radiation on molecules – a factor in climate change – and is not a refutation of the fact that CO2 and other greenhouse gases drive climate change.  Further, the blog mischaracterizes fundamental aspects of climate change science. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks ""For 20 years, I have studied the history of climate science ... I know of no evidence whatsoever to support the Einstein claim,"" Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard University, told USA TODAY in an email. USA TODAY reached out to social media users who shared the post for comment. The blog author could not be reached for comment. The blog claims Einstein's writing challenges a fundamental concept in global climate change science – that CO2 in the atmosphere reduces the release of Earth's thermal energy, or radiation, into space. But the science is clear. In the climate change model, global warming occurs through a multi-step process that begins with the sun. Fact check: Greenland is still losing ice; no reversal in trend The sun emits most of its radiation at wavelengths that are not absorbed by CO2 in Earth's atmosphere. Instead, Earth absorbs the radiation, causing the planet to heat up.  This heating causes Earth to emit its own radiation. However, Earth emits most of its radiation at different wavelengths than the sun – wavelengths that do get absorbed by CO2 in the atmosphere, Josh Willis, a NASA climate scientist, previously told USA TODAY.  When that CO2 absorbs the Earth's radiation, the molecule emits its own radiation. Some of this radiation gets directed back down toward Earth, further heating the planet. Increasing concentrations of CO2 or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere intensify this effect, Willis said.   The blog post claims a specific passage from Einstein's paper ""On the Quantum Theory of Radiation,"" originally published in 1916, directly refutes the concept of CO2-driven climate change. But experts say it doesn't. The content in the excerpt is ""disconnected from the actual mechanisms underlying climate change,"" Sukrit Ranjan, a planetary photochemist and postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University, told USA TODAY. In the excerpt, Einstein says an equation can be used to describe the average amount of energy molecules receive from radiation. He further states the equation is applicable regardless of what wavelengths of energy the molecules absorb and emit. Fact check: Japanese Meteorological Agency data shows warming on Japanese islan But then ""the blog author goes on to draw a completely specious conclusion from Einstein's statements,"" Grant Petty, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has authored two textbooks on atmospheric physics, told USA TODAY in an email. ""There's literally no discernible relationship between the subject of Einsteins' paper"" and the blog's claim that CO2 can't drive atmospheric warming, he said.  The blog post further claims Einstein's work ""refuted in advance"" the idea that radiation emitted back toward Earth by CO2 could cause atmospheric warming. But that's misleading, too. More:Festivals forced to adapt as climate change disrupts historic weather patterns The paper referenced in the blog was completed well after CO2 was identified as an important greenhouse gas in the 1800s. The idea that radiation emitted by the Earth is absorbed by CO2 and then re-emitted had also been described. Even the potential for coal burning to change Earth's climate was being discussed in the scientific community when Einstein was an active researcher. USA TODAY could not find evidence that Einstein explicitly challenged those ideas. ""To the best of my knowledge, there is no such evidence,"" Jürgen Renn, director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, told USA TODAY in an email.  In addition to mischaracterizing the significance and nature of Einstein's comments, the blog post misrepresents modern climate change science by claiming models only account for heat transfer through radiation. Convection – the transport of heat via the movement of molecules in the atmosphere – and other processes are also included in climate models.  Fact check:Video shows Austrian climate protest, not 'crisis actors' in Ukraine ""Many of the foundational papers in modern climate science, beginning in the 1960s, look at how convection and radiation work together,"" Petty said. ""The blog author apparently has no idea how many different energy transfer ... processes are considered in every climate model."" USA TODAY has previously debunked claims that climate change theory defies the laws of physics or overstates the role of CO2 in climate change.   Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that an Einstein paper contradicts CO2-driven climate change. This claim is built on a misunderstanding of the science of climate change and what Einstein discussed. The Einstein quote in the blog discusses the impact of radiation on molecules and does not challenge the concept of CO2-driven climate change in any way, according to experts. In the words of a University of Wisconsin professor, there is ""no discernible relationship"" between the quoted sections of Einstein's paper and the blog's claim that CO2 can't drive global warming.

It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine light to all of the people...to the entire cast and crew of 'King Richard,'"" an emotional Smith said during his acceptance speech. Minutes before his best actor win was announced, Smith slapped Chris Rock in the face after he made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith and her lack of hair. See our roundup for a complete list of tonight's winners.  Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska resigned from office on Saturday after a California jury convicted him of lying to federal authorities about an illegal campaign donation from a foreign national. In a letter to the House, Fortenberry said he was resigning from Congress, effective March 31. Fortenberry was indicted in October after authorities said he lied to FBI agents in two separate interviews about his knowledge of an illegal $30,000 contribution from his campaign from a foreign billionaire. Fortenberry’s announcement followed concerted pressure from political leaders in Nebraska and Washington for him to step down. His withdrawal from the primary leaves state Sen. Mike Flood as the likely GOP nominee. P.S. Like this roundup of stories? Sign up for ""The Short List"" newsletter here.

A top Ukrainian official accused Russia of trying to split Ukraine into two countries, drawing a comparison to North and South Korea. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, said Sunday that Russia was making ""an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" Reuters reported. “The occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine,” Budanov said in a statement released by the Defense Ministry. But he said Ukrainian guerrilla warfare would prevent that from happening. Russia has said its invasion is focused on recognizing the independence of Ukraine's Donbas region, which has been partially controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. The Russian Defense Ministry said last week Moscow had accomplished that goal, and would be moving to secure the ""liberation"" of Donetsk and Luhansk, two areas within Donbas. Budanov's comments came a day after President Joe Biden's final remarks during a speech Saturday in Poland, where he said of Putin: ""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” The White House has since clarified that the U.S. is not attempting to have Putin removed from office.

UKRAINE'S JEWS BAFFLED BY 'DE-NAZIFICATION':'We are that united family:' Russia's war uproots Ukrainian Jews amid false Nazi claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of treating its dead soldiers worse than animals, and said attempts by his country to exchange prisoners of war have been met with a lack of interest by its adversary. A news release from the president's office cites his new interview with Russian media, in which Zelenskyy said he's willing to conduct the prisoner exchange even while hostilities continue. ""It is not necessary to act according to some generally accepted canons: like, let’s wait until the end of the war, or let’s capture more ... I do not understand that,'' Zelenskyy said. The president also said an offer to hand the bodies of Russian soldiers to their relatives elicited a callous response he believes speaks poorly of how President Vladimir Putin's government treats its own people.   ""They first refused, then offered us some bags,'' Zelenskyy said. ""You know, even when a dog or a cat dies, people don't do so. These are garbage bags. I don't understand what people think, what the parents of these children think."" Russian media outlets have been banned from publishing the interview by the country's communications regulator and Internet censor, known as Roskomnadzor, the Washington Post reported. Hours after President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken made clear the United States does not plan to pursue regime change in Russia. ""I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,"" Blinken said Sunday during a press conference in Jerusalem. ""As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else, for that matter,” he said. As he walked out of church Sunday evening after returning stateside from Poland, Biden was asked if he was calling for regime change in Russia. His one-word answer, according to a pool report: ""No.'' In a sweeping and forceful speech concluding a four-day trip to Europe, Biden on Saturday cast the war in Ukraine as part of an ongoing battle for freedom and ended with a blunt call for Putin to be stopped.   ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland, in his strongest comments to date about his desire to see Putin gone. Shortly after the speech, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Biden was not calling for Putin to be removed from office. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded, “It’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia."" “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Peskov said. French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday distanced himself from President Joe Biden’s comments calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and someone who “cannot remain in power,” adding that he is trying to avoid an escalation from Russia. In an interview with French TV station France 3, Macron said he would not use that kind of language and noted his task is to achieve ""a cease-fire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means. ""If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions,” Macron said, according to a translation from France 24. Macron and Putin have remained in contact since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. – Rebecca Morin The United States’ top NATO representative clarified President Joe Biden’s comments in which he said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” saying the full administration believes “we cannot empower Putin right now to wage war in Ukraine or pursue these acts of aggression.” Julianne Smith, United States ambassador to NATO, said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that Biden met with Ukrainian refugees ahead of his speech Saturday and his ad-libbed line was a “human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day.” – Rebecca Morin Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian attacks, is now 85% destroyed, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Olga Stefanishyna, said Sunday: ""It simply does not exist anymore.'' ""In Mariupol, the situation is extremely complicated, although we managed to take out of there more than 150,000 people, but too many of them still remain there,"" she said on ABC News' ""This Week."" ""They don’t have access to water, to any food supplies, to anything."" She also said Russia has ""forcefully displaced"" some of Mariupol's people to Russia, echoing a claim made last week by the city council. Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus called the city ""a bit of a Ukrainian Alamo."" Mariupol is likely to fall to the Russians despite a vigorous defense, he said. ""It’s fighting to the last defender and pinning down multiple Russian battalions ... very heroically. But ultimately it looks as if it’s going to have to collapse. It’s going to be taken,"" he told ""This Week."" – Katie Wadington Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova indicated Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin should not lead the country if he is convicted of war crimes. Ukraine submitted all the applications to open investigations against Russia in international courts for war crimes, Markarova said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" “Every Russian that is responsible for it will have to end up in jail for these war crimes.(Putin) has nothing to do to lead a state if Russia would like to be a democratic or even a civilized state,” she said. “I think it will be difficult to run the state from The Hague,” Markarova said, referring to the Dutch city where those accused of war crimes are tried. Speaking on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Markarova called on Western allies to give Ukraine more military support. ""We are not asking for American soldiers, but we need all the support ... all the weapons including the anti-air, including the airplanes, everything, to stop this brutal destruction,"" she said. ""We will not surrender."" – Rebecca Morin and Katie Wadington The Biden administration decided over two weeks ago that a deal to send MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine – with the U.S. then replacing those with F-16s – was not possible, yet the issue remains a talking point. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, told ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that it should be revisited since the U.S. sends other military equipment to Ukraine. ""We should also send the MiG 29s, to raise that issue again,"" Portman said, noting Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a ""green light"" to the deal before the administration changed its mind. ""And the Ukrainians insist that they need it, they want it, it would be helpful. I think we need to trust them on that."" On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott echoed the same sentiment. Julianne Smith, United States Ambassador to NATO, said the administration was working with NATO allies to meet Ukraine’s defense needs but said the delivery of Polish fighter jets was not possible. “Poland came forward with the idea of offering the Soviet air jets, we looked at that, we had some questions about it and at the end the United State believed that in this case the delivery of those jets was untenable,” Smith said. Smith said there were questions about delivering the jets from Poland to Ukraine and concerns surrounding the Ukrainian pilots who could be flying the jets. – Ana Faguy and Katie Wadington Finland will discontinue train service into Russia on Monday, severing rail links into EU countries. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Finnish train operator VR has operated a route between Helsinki, Finland, and St. Petersburg, Russia, to ""provide a safe passage to the Finnish citizens."" “During these weeks, the people who have wanted to depart from Russia have had adequate time to leave. Now, due to the sanctions, we will discontinue the service for now”, Topi Simola, SVP for Passenger Services at VR Group. said late last week. A spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was ""extremely negative"" for U.S. relations with Russia. “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course, it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.” The White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, saying the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region."" Peskov said that with his statements, Biden was ""narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration."""

In an interview with French TV station France 3, Macron said he would not use that kind of language and noted his task is to achieve ""a cease-fire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means. ""If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions,” Macron said, according to a translation from France 24. Macron and Putin have remained in contact since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. – Rebecca Morin The United States’ top NATO representative clarified President Joe Biden’s comments in which he said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” saying the full administration believes “we cannot empower Putin right now to wage war in Ukraine or pursue these acts of aggression.” Julianne Smith, United States ambassador to NATO, said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that Biden met with Ukrainian refugees ahead of his speech Saturday and his ad-libbed line was a “human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day.” – Rebecca Morin Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian attacks, is now 85% destroyed, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Olga Stefanishyna, said Sunday: ""It simply does not exist anymore.'' ""In Mariupol, the situation is extremely complicated, although we managed to take out of there more than 150,000 people, but too many of them still remain there,"" she said on ABC News' ""This Week."" ""They don’t have access to water, to any food supplies, to anything."" She also said Russia has ""forcefully displaced"" some of Mariupol's people to Russia, echoing a claim made last week by the city council. Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus called the city ""a bit of a Ukrainian Alamo."" Mariupol is likely to fall to the Russians despite a vigorous defense, he said. ""It’s fighting to the last defender and pinning down multiple Russian battalions ... very heroically. But ultimately it looks as if it’s going to have to collapse. It’s going to be taken,"" he told ""This Week."" – Katie Wadington Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova indicated Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin should not lead the country if he is convicted of war crimes. Ukraine submitted all the applications to open investigations against Russia in international courts for war crimes, Markarova said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" “Every Russian that is responsible for it will have to end up in jail for these war crimes.(Putin) has nothing to do to lead a state if Russia would like to be a democratic or even a civilized state,” she said. “I think it will be difficult to run the state from The Hague,” Markarova said, referring to the Dutch city where those accused of war crimes are tried. Speaking on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Markarova called on Western allies to give Ukraine more military support. ""We are not asking for American soldiers, but we need all the support ... all the weapons including the anti-air, including the airplanes, everything, to stop this brutal destruction,"" she said. ""We will not surrender."" – Rebecca Morin and Katie Wadington The Biden administration decided over two weeks ago that a deal to send MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine – with the U.S. then replacing those with F-16s – was not possible, yet the issue remains a talking point. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, told ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that it should be revisited since the U.S. sends other military equipment to Ukraine. ""We should also send the MiG 29s, to raise that issue again,"" Portman said, noting Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a ""green light"" to the deal before the administration changed its mind. ""And the Ukrainians insist that they need it, they want it, it would be helpful. I think we need to trust them on that."" On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott echoed the same sentiment. Julianne Smith, United States Ambassador to NATO, said the administration was working with NATO allies to meet Ukraine’s defense needs but said the delivery of Polish fighter jets was not possible. “Poland came forward with the idea of offering the Soviet air jets, we looked at that, we had some questions about it and at the end the United State believed that in this case the delivery of those jets was untenable,” Smith said. Smith said there were questions about delivering the jets from Poland to Ukraine and concerns surrounding the Ukrainian pilots who could be flying the jets. – Ana Faguy and Katie Wadington Finland will discontinue train service into Russia on Monday, severing rail links into EU countries. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine, Finnish train operator VR has operated a route between Helsinki, Finland, and St. Petersburg, Russia, to ""provide a safe passage to the Finnish citizens."" “During these weeks, the people who have wanted to depart from Russia have had adequate time to leave. Now, due to the sanctions, we will discontinue the service for now”, Topi Simola, SVP for Passenger Services at VR Group. said late last week. A spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was ""extremely negative"" for U.S. relations with Russia. “Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course, it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.” The White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, saying the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region."" Peskov said that with his statements, Biden was ""narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration."""

An Orthodox Jew born in Kyiv, Khorenjenko said she has never faced any organized or even casual discrimination in daily life. And she has certainly never seen any evidence of Nazi activity. “There were boys who fought in school, but it was not because they were Jewish. They fought because they are boys,” said Khorenjenko, 33, whose Jewish great-grandmother fled Poland before the German invasion during World War II. “I’ve never seen anything like that,"" she said of Putin's claims. In a speech announcing the attack on Ukraine, Putin said he wanted to “de-Nazify” the country, a statement that many found baffling and bizarre. Ukraine is a democratic country led by a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose family was almost wiped out in the Holocaust. Zelenskyy said three of his grandfather's brothers were victims of the Holocaust, executed by German occupiers. His grandfather fought in World War II as part of the Soviet army. Putin's war has uprooted thousands of Ukrainian Jews, including approximately 5,000 refugees who flooded into neighboring Moldova. They've found safety and comfort in shelters that once served far different purposes, including a Soviet-era sanatorium and a wedding venue with crystal chandeliers and velvet-roped chairs. “We had a good life. We had jobs and houses. Nobody wanted to leave,"" said Viktoria Fikhman, 37, who escaped shelling in Odesa with her husband and two children, including a young daughter with chickenpox. They stay at a shelter overseen in part by members of Moldova’s Jewish community. They're not sure where they'll go next – apartments in the capital of Chisinau are either unavailable or too expensive. OnPolitics:Should Russia be kicked out of the G-20? At another shelter, refugee Tatiana Larina, 73, from Mykolaiv, Ukraine, recalled how she saw antisemitism in her youth but never since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. Her father changed his name to be less Jewish, she said, and that helped reduce some of the hateful attention. “Nobody painted stars on doors or walls. It was more of a rotten attitude then,” she said through an interpreter. “But after Ukraine became an independent country, I haven’t seen anything like that. The attitude changed.” 'Too tired to be nervous':Some Ukrainian refugees return home, despite escalating Russian attacks Sitting on her narrow bed as an aging television played clips of reality TV shows, Larina said she was thankful to have left safely when the shelling began. She recalled packing her tan leather suitcase by candlelight when the power went out and how some journalists who saw her struggling to carry the bag helped load it onto a refugee bus. Her husband died of COVID-19 a year ago, and she hopes to migrate to Israel, at least temporarily.             Khorenjenko, Fikhman and Larina are among about 3.7 million Ukrainians who fled their country after Russia's invasion. Though most left via Poland, a growing number cross into neighboring Moldova, and those of the Jewish faith have found comfort within the open doors – albeit guarded by a metal detector – of the Chabad Synagogue of Chisinau. There, faith leaders, including Rabbi Mandel Askerold serve hot kosher meals, minister to spiritual needs and arrange housing. Within the compound's walls, workers boil eggs and bake challah.

President Joe Biden on Monday said he was voicing his indignation with the barbaric invasion of Ukraine and not a U.S. policy change with his remark last weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” “I'm not walking anything back,” Biden said Monday from the White House. “The fact of the matter is I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the actions of this man, which is just brutality.” Biden noted that he felt that outrage after meeting with refugees in Warsaw, Poland.  “I want to make it clear, I wasn't then nor am I now articulating a policy change,” he said. “I was expressing moral outrage that I feel. I make no apologies for it."" The president also said he doesn't believe his comments complicate the diplomatic efforts to end the war or escalate the hostilities. ""What complicates the situation at the moment is the escalatory efforts of Putin to continue to engage in carnage,'' Biden said, ""the kind of behavior that makes the whole world say, 'My God, what is this man doing?''' Biden was asked whether he would meet with Putin and did not directly answer yes or no, saying it would be conditional on what the Russian leader would want to discuss. Putin has not called for a meeting between them. -- Rebecca Morin Latest developments ►A “massive” cyberattack knocked Ukraine’s national telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom almost completely offline Monday in what network monitors called its most severe outage since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion. ►Retaliatory visa measures against ""unfriendly countries"" are being developed in Russia, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ►Irpin, a sprawling Kyiv suburban city of 60,000, has been liberated from Russian forces, Mayor Alexander Markushin said.

Teachers were told not to overwhelm students already under strain from the war. ►The Oscars took 30 seconds of silence for Ukraine, beginning with a tribute from Ukrainian-born Mila Kunis. Russian troops have ceased making advances on the ground toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and appear to have refocused their aims in eastern Ukraine, a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday. The Russians appear intent on cutting off Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, according to the official, who discussed intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity. The Russian move could also be aimed at establishing authority there to gain leverage in negotiations for a cease-fire or peace deal, the official said. Russia has been backing separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014. Last week, a high-ranking Russian military official claimed the ""main tasks"" of the invasion that began Feb. 24 were successfully completed. ""The combat capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces have been substantially reduced, which allows us to concentrate our main efforts on achieving the main goal – the liberation of Donbas,"" Sergei Rudskoy said. FALLOUT FROM BIDEN'S 'CANNOT REMAIN IN POWER' REMARK:‘Clarity is important’: Dems clarify Biden's comment about Putin; Republicans warn words carry weight The Pentagon official, however, said Ukrainian forces continue to thwart Russian efforts to dominate the country’s airspace. Russian pilots have been averse to risk, fearing attacks from Ukrainian air defenses. Most of Russia’s air-launched cruise missile attacks have come from aircraft operating from the safety of airspace over Russia or Belarus, the official said. Ukrainian resistance has held in most major cities, the official said. Mariupol in the south, however, continues to face heavy bombardment, and the mayor of the port city on Monday called for evacuation of the remaining 160,000 residents. The Pentagon's expectations that Russia would replace its combat losses in Ukraine with troops based in other countries appear to have become reality. Britain’s Defense Ministry said up to 1,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a private Russian military contractor that has been accused of human rights abuses, will most likely be sent to fight in Eastern Ukraine. Air Vice-Marshal Mick Smeath, London’s defense attaché in Washington, said in a statement that Russia has likely been forced to reprioritize Wagner personnel for Ukraine at the expense of its operations in Africa and Syria. The Pentagon had also indicated Russia would draw from its troops elsewhere. In December, the EU imposed sanctions on the Wagner Group and its founder, Dmitry Utkin, for fomenting violence and committing human rights abuses in the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine. Three members of the delegations attending the peace talks in Kyiv on March 3-4, including Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons, the Netherlands-based Bellingcat investigative journalism outlet reported. Abramovich and two senior members of the Ukrainian negotiating team developed symptoms that included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal, citing Western experts who looked into the incident, said it was hard to determine whether the symptoms were caused by a chemical or biological agent or by electromagnetic-radiation attack. A spokesperson for Abramovich, a longtime Putin adviser and owner of the British soccer team Chelsea FC, confirmed to the BBC that he developed the symptoms. The reports did not determine who would have been responsible. The Journal reported claims the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by hardliners in Russia who wanted to sabotage the talks. The Kremlin tamped down expectations Monday that face-to-face talks with Ukraine negotiators scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday would result in a deal to end Russia's deadly, destructive invasion. ""Regrettably, we cannot say there have been any significant achievements or breakthroughs so far,"" Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. But he said the face-to-face meeting in Turkey could allow for ""more focused, tighter and meaningful"" talks. The talks come as the mayor of Mariupol called for evacuation of the remaining 160,000 residents, saying the city is virtually without food, water, power and other supplies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest appeal for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, saying it would be counterproductive until Ukraine and Russia are close to agreeing on key issues. The Pentagon is sending six Navy jets that specialize in suppressing enemy air defense to bolster NATO’s eastern flank, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Monday. The Navy EA-18 Growlers are based at Whidbey Island, Washington, and will be sent to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, Kirby said. They will not fly missions in Ukraine against Russian forces. The deployment will include about 240 pilots, crews and maintainers. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin deployed the warplanes to keep “options open,” Kirby said. “They’re not being sent because of some sort of acute threat that was perceived or some specific incident that happened,” Kirby said. – Tom Vanden Brook Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told independent Russian journalists that his government would consider declaring neutrality and offering security guarantees to Russia. That pact would include keeping Ukraine nuclear-free, he said. But Zelenskyy said adopting a neutral status would need to be guaranteed by third parties and put to Ukrainian voters in a referendum after Russian troops withdraw – within a few months once Russian troops leave. Russia almost immediately banned Zelenskyy's remarks from being published. Roskomnadzor, the Russian federal agency regulating communications for Moscow, issued the ban Sunday and said there could be action taken against the Russian media outlets that took part, including “those that are foreign media outlets acting as foreign agents.” Russia recently passed a law threatening up to 15 years of prison time for anyone publishing information that goes against Moscow's narrative about the war. The independent Russian publication Novaya Gazeta shut down Monday after getting its second warning from the state censuring agency Roskomnadzor. The publication was called out Monday after conducting a banned interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""After that, we will suspend the publication of the newspaper online and in print until the end of the 'special operation on the territory of Ukraine,'"" the publication said on Twitter. The Kremlin refers to its invasion of Ukraine as a special operation. Novaya Gazeta was previously ordered to remove articles about the war from its website. Dmitry Muratov, the publication's founder and editor, was a co-winner of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. Muratov was singled out for his ""efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace."" Russian shelling of the southern port city of Mariupol has made living there impossible and the remaining 160,000 civilians should be evacuated, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said. He said the city, home to more than 400,000 people before the war began, has virtually no water, heat, electricity, supplies or communication. The Ukraine government estimates that 5,000 civilians have been killed by Russia's siege of the city that began March 1. Over 200 of those killed were children, the government says. Boychenko told the local UNIAN news agency that 40% of Mariupol's residential buildings are now uninhabitable. ""The city is encircled and that circle is of course shrinking,"" he said. The Ukraine Foreign Ministry tweeted: ""While #Mariupol besieged and bombed, people fight to survive. The humanitarian situation in the city is catastrophic. #Russian Armed Forces is turning the city into dust."" The Moscow Exchange dipped 2.2% on Monday, the first day that trading of all stocks was allowed since the war began. Some breakers were in place to limit volatility.  The war started Feb. 24 and Russian stocks crashed by about one-third the next day. Since then trading has been nonexistent or limited. Foreigners remain banned from trading until Friday. On Monday, shares of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, fell almost 5%. CEO Herman Gref, a close adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin  for decades, was added to the U.S. sanctions list last week. Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, was down 1.7%.  From Lebanon, Iraq and Syria to Sudan and Yemen, millions of people in the Middle East whose lives were already upended by conflict, displacement and poverty are now wondering where their next meals will come from. Ukraine and Russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports, which countries in the Middle East rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles. They are also top exporters of other grains and the sunflower seed oil that is used for cooking. Even before the war in Ukraine, people in countries across the Middle East and North Africa were not getting enough food. Now with trade disruptions spurred by the conflict, more commodities are becoming either unaffordable or unavailable. “Put simply, people cannot afford food of the quality or quantity that they need, with those in conflict- and crisis-affected countries ... at greatest risk,” said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch. Just one month since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more than 3.8 million refugees have been forced to flee the country, making this the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, according to the United Nations refugee agency. An additional 6.5 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine and over 12 million more have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war. Humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially. ""Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines,"" the agency announced in a bulletin. ""The delivery of lifesaving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access."" –Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy"

One out of every five Americans who quit jobs during the Great Resignation say they now regret the move, don't like their new position enough to stay or are actively searching for a new gig, according to a Harris Poll survey for USA TODAY conducted during March 18 through 20. Many workers acted hastily during a pandemic that fostered severe worker shortages, a seismic shift to remote work and widespread burnout, employment experts say. ""People will make very fast moves,"" says Kathryn Minshew, CEO of The Muse, an online job board and advice company that specializes in helping candidates find the best cultural fit. Then, they wonder, ""Did I just make a mistake?"" And less than four in 10 quitters feel happy, successful or valued in their new roles.

UKRAINE WAR'S IMPACT ON TECH: Companies of all sizes rely on Ukrainian tech workers. The Russian invasion is disrupting the industry. Since cannabis is illegal at the federal level, pot shops have limited access to traditional banking and financial services, causing them to have a significant amount of cash on hand and making them attractive targets of criminals, according to Morgan Fox, the political director for NORML. In fact, reports of armed robberies at cannabis dispensaries have nearly doubled in the first quarter of this year compared with all of last year, according to data maintained by the Craft Cannabis Coalition.  As a way to prevent pot shops from having large sums of cash in-store, some advocates and legislators are calling for the passage of the Safe and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, which would protect banks that choose to work with cannabis businesses. The legislation would make it easier for businesses to open a bank account and accept alternative forms of payment other than cash. “The SAFE Banking Act would be a great incremental step, not only in terms of providing things like banking services and allowing them to do cashless transactions much easier, which would greatly increase the safety of people that work at these businesses, … but it also allows businesses to be able to save money,” Fox added.

Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Monday, the 28th of March 2022. Today, company's decisions amid tightening abortion restrictions. Plus an Academy Awards to remember and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  ♦ Citigroup quietly expanded employees' health coverage in January to include paying for travel to get an abortion. Other large employers may face similar decisions as states impose new restrictions. Finance reporter Elisabeth Buchwald has more. Elisabeth Buchwald: The interesting thing about what Citi is doing is they're wanting to have this policy to attract and retain workers, especially in states like Texas, where abortions are restricted after six weeks. And plenty of other states are considering tighter restrictions as well, especially as the Supreme Court considers potentially reversing some of the Roe v. Wade laws that have been in effect for a while now. And companies are kind of in this difficult position, typically ones that don't want to take a stance in politics and want to be rather neutral or finding themselves like Citi saying that they have to do something because staying silent isn't an option. At least that's what sources told me. And if the Supreme Court does reverse some of Roe v. Wade, there's no way that companies can stay silent. It affects so much of their workforce here. The other interesting thing with what Citi is doing is regardless of what the Supreme Court decides, it puts pressure on other banks and other competitors to institute a policy like that. They're the first major bank to do it and one of a handful of major corporations. We've seen some others like Salesforce offering to pay for travel expenses if people want to move out of Texas. We've seen Match, which is headquartered in Texas, offering to pay for their employees to get an abortion out of the state. And Bumble is also doing a similar thing. But then there are plenty of companies like Charles Schwab and Oracle that relocated to Texas from California who aren't doing anything at the moment. I reached out to them and I didn't hear anything back. So all that is to say that, yes, it could put a lot of pressure on them. You can find this full story in today's episode description. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told independent Russian journalists yesterday that his government would consider declaring neutrality and to offer security guarantees to Russia. Zelenskyy said the pact would keep Ukraine nuclear free as well. But he added that the agreement would need to be guaranteed by third parties and put to Ukrainian voters in a referendum after Russian troops withdraw from the country. Russia almost immediately banned those remarks from being published as part of a more general effort that threatens 15 years of prison time for anyone publishing information against Moscow's narrative of the war. Beginning today, Ukraine and Russia will meet in person in Turkey according to Zelenskyy, though Russia's top negotiators said those talks will actually begin tomorrow. Just over a month since Russia's invasion, more than 3.6 million refugees have fled the country of 44 million according to the United Nations Refugee Agency. And an additional 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Over 12 million have been affected overall in the area's hardest hit by the war. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be increasingly focused on Ukraine's east. That's where some of the worst destruction has come and also where most of Ukraine's military is right now. On Friday, the Russian military declared that the first stage of its operation had largely been accomplished. Many observers say the shift in strategy could reflect President Vladimir Putin's acknowledgement that his plan for an all out blitz in Ukraine failed and that he was forced to narrow his goals and change tactics. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence Kyrylo Budanov said yesterday that the change in focus could reflect Putin's hope to break Ukraine in two like North Korea. Well, it was an Academy Awards to remember. The Oscars returned last night to Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles and the show brought hosts back: Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes. But the night's biggest headline grabbing moment came when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage and cursed him out over a joke Rock made about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Entertain This! host Ralphie Aversa recapped what happened from Los Angeles. Chris Rock: Oh wow! Ralphie Aversa: Whoa! This is the moment that stole the Oscars. Chris Rock on stage here at the Dolby Theatre making a comment about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will's wife. Not the first time it happened. It occurred back in 2016 when Chris was hosting the Academy Awards and it happened again Sunday night. Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it. All right. Rock was on stage to present best documentary but soon after the joke, Smith joined him. As network delays tried to catch up, Smith was caught on camera yelling at Rock to keep Jada's name out of his mouth. As for Rock, the LAPD says he won't press charges. Overshadowed in all of this, the award for Best Doc, it went to Questlove Summer of Soul. I asked the multi-hyphenate about earning a nod for his directorial debut on the red carpet. Questlove: I was in the pandemic and I needed to put my creativity somewhere in this world and I put it all in the film. And I guess this is the result of it. It was also a big night for Ariana DeBose. She won Best Supporting Actress for West Side Story. She's the first Afro-Latina actress and first openly gay actress of color to win. Ariana DeBose: For all the things we have to work on, we've taken some beautiful steps forward and I celebrate that tonight. And Troy Kotsur, the first deaf male actor to win an Oscar. He takes home the award for his supporting role in CODA. The movie went on to win Best Picture. And oh yeah, Will Smith did end up winning his first Oscar, too, for playing Venus and Serena Williams' dad in King Richard. Smith tearfully apologized to the Academy in his acceptance speech. Will Smith: People talk crazy about you. In this business you got to be able to have people disrespecting you. Will Smith was all the talk at one of the hottest after parties hosted by Vanity Fair. Here's actor Henry Golding followed by Queer Eye's Karamo Brown. Henry Golding: I think they're both legends. I think there's something deeper sort of to be discussed and I hope they both step up man to man and figure it all out, which I'm sure they will. Thank you so much. Karamo Brown: Yeah. I think what we need to learn is that as celebrities, we look at them as if they're not human beings. And sometimes we poke, we poke, we poke and tonight was a high emotion night for Will Smith, regardless. And I think we have to sometimes remember at a certain point, everyone breaks, but I think these are two men that will actually come together, figure it out and say, ""Okay, enough is enough. I'm sorry."" You know what I mean? But I haven't been in that situation. I never condone violence or anything of that nature, but I also could understand protecting those you love. As for the night's biggest award, CODA won best picture, telling the story of a singer who's the child of deaf parents. For all the winners and more of last night's top moments, head to USATODAY.com. Extreme heat already disrupts air travel. And with climate change, it's going to get worse. Reporter Elizabeth Weise explains what the airline industry and airplane manufacturers are doing to get ahead of the problem and what their role might be in causing it. Elizabeth Weise: There's two important things to know about. One, heat does not make planes fall out of the sky like a toolbox as one of the test pilots that I spoke with said. So you don't need to worry that an extreme heat event is going to make your plane not fly safely because once they're way up in the atmosphere, it's cold up there and they do fine. The issue is lift. When a plane takes off, it's got engines that push it forward in the air. It's got wings that are set at the right angle just like if you stick your hand out of the window in a car that's going fast and you tilt it up a little bit, the air pushes it upward. That's exactly how a plane takes off. When it's really hot, the air gets less dense. When the air is less dense, it takes more power or a longer distance for a plane to be able to take off. Generally speaking, when things get over 110, 115, it's possible and it has happened that a flight might, for example, need to remove passengers or baggage because it has to take on more fuel so that it can get up to the right speeds. As we increasingly see these high heat events in the United States, we're going to have to start to take these things into account. So the airlines and more importantly airplane manufacturers are already thinking about this and working on it. And one, because they think way far out and two, because when you buy an airplane, it's going to be in your inventory of planes for 10, 20 years, depending on the airline. And so they really need to think hard about what planes am I buying now? What are the conditions going to be in 10 or 20 years? And what do I want to own then? So the things we're seeing our lighter planes, planes using materials that are lighter. So there's just less weight. So it takes less fuel to get them up in the air and keep them there. We're also seeing more and more efficient engines being designed. Every five or 10 years, we get new engine designs that really allow planes to use less fuel, which is what in the end, this is all about. And then the federal aviation administration has also come out with a climate change plan because the other side of this to remember is that they don't cause global warming, but there is significant portion of the United States' CO2 emissions and so aviation also needs to lower its CO2 emissions. And in the next couple of years, we should see the first electric airplanes come out. Those will only be for short haul flights because aviation fuel is just so energy dense. It's really hard to replace it for a long haul flight. But for short haul flights, it's looking like we'll have electric planes. I mean, if you're flying from Seattle to Portland or something like that, but that's a lot of flights, so that will be helpful. You can find Elizabeth's full story in today's episode description. The US Capitol will reopen to the public today for guided tours. The move comes two years after the coronavirus pandemic put a stop to visits, though for now, tours will only be for limited groups that have already registered in advance. It's the latest push by Congress to relax COVID-19 restrictions. Mask requirements inside the Capitol were relaxed weeks ago and the adjacent Capitol visitor center is tentatively set to reopen to limited visitors on May 30th. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us wherever you're listening right now seven days a week. Thanks to PJ Elliott for his great work on the show. And I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY."

A long list of Republican and Democratic candidates that includes businessmen, attorneys and seasoned politicians is competing for Ohio’s vote.  One of the most prominent Republican names is JD Vance, a venture capitalist and conservative commentator who appears regularly on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show. Vance burst onto the political media scene in 2016 when his memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" about growing up in a small Midwest town made him a media voice of the white working-class during the 2016 presidential election.  Having never held public office, he has leaned into his status as an “outsider,” branding himself as the anti-establishment candidate.  Vance has been backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel – who donated $10 million to a Super PAC supporting Vance – Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Just weeks before the primary election, Vance won the heated competition between most of the GOP candidates for former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Who is Josh Mandel?:What to know about the ex-Ohio state treasurer in his third Senate run Who is Jane Timken?:What to know about the ex-Ohio GOP chair running for Senate Who is Mike Gibbons?:What to know about businessman leading Ohio GOP Senate primary polls Democratic frontrunner:What to know about Tim Ryan, the congressman running for Senate in Ohio Vance has a few titles.  He is a venture capitalist who runs Narya, an Ohio-based venture capital firm he founded and launched in 2020 for startups around the country.  He got his start in the venture capital world at Mithril Capital, an investment firm co-founded by Thiel, a Republican super-donor who was an early investor in Facebook. Vance has held top positions in venture capital funds, including Revolution LLC.  But Vance’s real claim to fame is his career as a conservative commentator, which was ignited by the success of his 2016 memoir, a New York Times bestseller. Cable news shows frequently booked Vance for appearances during the 2016 election.  He has kept his political celebrity, amassing close to 200,000 followers on Twitter in the time since. He became a vocal supporter of Trump, despite criticizing him before the election, and remains a network TV regular.  Vance was born on August 2, 1984. He is 37 years old.  Vance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, a small town of less than 50,000 residents near Cincinnati and Dayton.  Vance is based in Cincinnati, according to his Twitter profile.  Online reports show varying and unconfirmed figures for Vance’s net worth, but his Senate financial disclosure provides some insight into his wealth and earnings.  According to the report, Vance earned more than $1 million in non-investment income, including a $408,000 salary from Nayra and $347,000 in royalties from his memoir. The report lists more than 100 investments with their total value ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Congressional guidelines allow candidates and lawmakers to report their wealth using wide ranges rather than specific values. There are eight candidates in the Republican primary including Vance. Among them are former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken, Ohio State Sen. Matt Dolan, Cleveland businessman Mike Gibbons and former Ohio treasurer Josh Mandel. Portman endorsed Timken to be his successor.  Vance’s campaign outlines thirteen issues.  The main economic issues include revitalizing American manufacturing and addressing inflation. His platform suggests raising taxes on large corporations that do business overseas while cutting taxes for small American businesses.  Another of his key issues is immigration. Vance wants to finish building Trump’s wall and increase the number of Border Patrol agents. His campaign released a controversial TV ad that opens with Vance sarcastically asking viewers ""Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans,"" before decrying the press, which Vance says calls supporters of Trump's wall racist. According to his campaign, Vance would oppose amnesty for undocumented migrants in the United States and favor a more stringent merit-based immigration system than is in place already.  Other promises involve some of the hot-button conservative issues that have taken shape in the Biden era. Vance says he will support cutting funding to universities that teach critical race theory or “radical gender ideology” and break up big tech companies, which Vance says censor conservatives. Vance also opposes abortion, favors gun rights, and supports further voting requirements such as showing your ID to vote and ending expanded mail-in voting.    Vance earned a law degree from Yale Law School in 2013 after graduating from Ohio State University with a degree in political science and philosophy in 2009.  Vance worked briefly as a lawyer for Sidley Austin, an Illinois-based firm, before he pursued an investing career in Silicon Valley. Vance joined the Marines in 2003 after graduating from high school. He served in the Iraq War, working in public affairs for the Corps. Vance was discharged from the Marines in 2007.  Yes, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is Vance’s memoir. It details his rocky childhood in Middletown, Ohio and joining the Marines before pursuing an education at Ohio State University and Yale Law School.  The book was made into a 2020 Netflix film starring Amy Adams.  Vance married a fellow Yale Law School classmate, Usha Chilukuri Vance. Chilukuri is a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a private law firm. She clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts from 2017 to 2018 and for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from 2014 to 2015, when Kavanaugh was a federal district judge. Vance and Chilukuri have two children together.  Vance made headlines in February when he said “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” on Steve Bannon’s podcast, just days before Putin launched his invasion. Vance said he thought Joe Biden should focus on border security at the U.S.-Mexico border, and not Ukraine’s border.  Vance doubled down on this sentiment as the war in Ukraine broke out. His campaign website features a pop-up window with the message “Secure our Southern Border and NOT Ukraine’s border!” ⁠— a message he has repeated on Twitter. "

Who is Josh Mandel?:What to know about the ex-Ohio state treasurer in his third Senate run Who is Jane Timken?:What to know about the ex-Ohio GOP chair running for Senate Who is Mike Gibbons?:What to know about businessman leading Ohio GOP Senate primary polls Democratic frontrunner:What to know about Tim Ryan, the congressman running for Senate in Ohio Vance has a few titles.  He is a venture capitalist who runs Narya, an Ohio-based venture capital firm he founded and launched in 2020 for startups around the country.  He got his start in the venture capital world at Mithril Capital, an investment firm co-founded by Thiel, a Republican super-donor who was an early investor in Facebook. Vance has held top positions in venture capital funds, including Revolution LLC.  But Vance’s real claim to fame is his career as a conservative commentator, which was ignited by the success of his 2016 memoir, a New York Times bestseller. Cable news shows frequently booked Vance for appearances during the 2016 election.  He has kept his political celebrity, amassing close to 200,000 followers on Twitter in the time since. He became a vocal supporter of Trump, despite criticizing him before the election, and remains a network TV regular.  Vance was born on August 2, 1984. He is 37 years old.  Vance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, a small town of less than 50,000 residents near Cincinnati and Dayton.  Vance is based in Cincinnati, according to his Twitter profile.  Online reports show varying and unconfirmed figures for Vance’s net worth, but his Senate financial disclosure provides some insight into his wealth and earnings.  According to the report, Vance earned more than $1 million in non-investment income, including a $408,000 salary from Nayra and $347,000 in royalties from his memoir. The report lists more than 100 investments with their total value ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Congressional guidelines allow candidates and lawmakers to report their wealth using wide ranges rather than specific values. There are eight candidates in the Republican primary including Vance. Among them are former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken, Ohio State Sen. Matt Dolan, Cleveland businessman Mike Gibbons and former Ohio treasurer Josh Mandel. Portman endorsed Timken to be his successor.  Vance’s campaign outlines thirteen issues.  The main economic issues include revitalizing American manufacturing and addressing inflation. His platform suggests raising taxes on large corporations that do business overseas while cutting taxes for small American businesses.  Another of his key issues is immigration. Vance wants to finish building Trump’s wall and increase the number of Border Patrol agents. His campaign released a controversial TV ad that opens with Vance sarcastically asking viewers ""Are you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans,"" before decrying the press, which Vance says calls supporters of Trump's wall racist. According to his campaign, Vance would oppose amnesty for undocumented migrants in the United States and favor a more stringent merit-based immigration system than is in place already.  Other promises involve some of the hot-button conservative issues that have taken shape in the Biden era. Vance says he will support cutting funding to universities that teach critical race theory or “radical gender ideology” and break up big tech companies, which Vance says censor conservatives. Vance also opposes abortion, favors gun rights, and supports further voting requirements such as showing your ID to vote and ending expanded mail-in voting.    Vance earned a law degree from Yale Law School in 2013 after graduating from Ohio State University with a degree in political science and philosophy in 2009.  Vance worked briefly as a lawyer for Sidley Austin, an Illinois-based firm, before he pursued an investing career in Silicon Valley. Vance joined the Marines in 2003 after graduating from high school. He served in the Iraq War, working in public affairs for the Corps. Vance was discharged from the Marines in 2007.  Yes, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is Vance’s memoir. It details his rocky childhood in Middletown, Ohio and joining the Marines before pursuing an education at Ohio State University and Yale Law School.  The book was made into a 2020 Netflix film starring Amy Adams.  Vance married a fellow Yale Law School classmate, Usha Chilukuri Vance. Chilukuri is a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a private law firm. She clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts from 2017 to 2018 and for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from 2014 to 2015, when Kavanaugh was a federal district judge. Vance and Chilukuri have two children together.  Vance made headlines in February when he said “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” on Steve Bannon’s podcast, just days before Putin launched his invasion. Vance said he thought Joe Biden should focus on border security at the U.S.-Mexico border, and not Ukraine’s border.  Vance doubled down on this sentiment as the war in Ukraine broke out. His campaign website features a pop-up window with the message “Secure our Southern Border and NOT Ukraine’s border!” ⁠— a message he has repeated on Twitter. "

Since March 13, the same meme generated more than 76,000 interactions on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.

Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks  But fact-checking organizations and Wali himself have debunked the rumor. He has appeared in video interviews since the claims first surfaced, and there are no confirmed reports of him being killed as of March 25. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the posts for comment. Wali has confirmed to several Canadian news outlets in video interviews that he is still alive, while also clarifying that doesn’t hold a world record for being the deadliest sniper and that he hasn't been fighting in Mariupol. “I was the last person to learn the news that I was dead,” Wali told Global News from Kyiv in a March 22 video interview. He added that he is “well-fed, rested and all good.” In another interview with CBC News on March 22, Wali said he has “never seen Mariupol in my life” and that he doesn't hold any record forbeing the deadliest sniper in the world. Wali told the outlet that he was working as a computer programmer in Canada prior to the war, and he wasn’t actively training.   He left his phone at a secure base before leaving to fight so Russian intelligence wouldn't be alerted about his whereabouts, according to CBC News. After spending a week on the front lines, he returned to a safe location and turned on his phone to messages from his family and friends asking if he was still alive.  ""The rumors that I had died in combat were completely ridiculous,"" Wali wrote in a March 22 Facebook post, according to Google Translate. Similarly, the Norman Brigade, a group of former Canadian soldiers, took to Facebook on March 18 to write that Wali is ""alive and well."" Wali is a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan with the Canadian Royal 22nd Regiment, according to the Toronto Sun. He has used the nickname ""Wali"" to protect his family in Canada from being targeted. He has authored books about his time in Afghanistan under the nickname. Lt. Gen. Frances Allen, Canada's vice chief of the defense staff, issued an order on March 24 preventing Canadian soldiers from joining Ukraine's foreign legion due to concerns that captured troops could be used as a Russian propaganda tool, The Guardian reported.  Fact check roundup: What's true and what's false about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Canadian sniper Wali was killed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

She was spotted in a car, accompanied by her second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, being driven from Windsor Castle where she has been living since the start of the pandemic.   After the 1,800 invited guests had been seated, a fanfare sounded and the queen entered, welcomed by the Very Reverend David Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, who conducted the service.  She walked into the ancient abbey through a side door on the arm of Prince Andrew, then separated from him to walk to her seat alone, easing concerns about her health that had raised questions about whether she would attend. It was her first major public event since unspecified mobility issues hampered her ability to walk up and down steps or long distances.  She sat in a throne-like chair at the front of the congregation, flanked by senior members of the royal family and backed up by row after row of more royals and leaders of Britain. The monarch wore a dark green coat with a black color, a matching hat trimmed in black and black gloves.  The queen's appearance for the ceremony to pay tribute to her husband of 73 years, who died in April 2021, gave Britons some reassurance that their sovereign for the last 70 years had not been entirely discomfited by illness or age. Her ability to get around may be more restricted and she now carries her husband's walking stick, but she was carrying on.  The service for the late Duke of Edinburgh, who died just short of his 100th birthday, was scheduled because his funeral in 2021 was limited to just 30 people under Britain's then-stringent pandemic rules.  The funeral was televised, leaving the nation with a poignant image of the queen sitting alone in her pew at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.  Now that the pandemic has eased in Britain, Philip's family and the nation wanted to give him a proper sendoff in the 753-year-old royal church where British and English monarchs have been crowned, married, buried and mourned for centuries.  The service incorporated some elements originally planned for the funeral that had to be dropped, including music: The choir, for instance, sang ""Te Deum in C"" by English composer Benjamin Britten, originally selected by Prince Philip for his funeral service. ""The Queen has also been actively involved in the plans for today’s Service of Thanksgiving, with many elements reflecting Her Majesty’s wishes,"" Buckingham Palace said Tuesday in announcing the order of service. This month, the queen, who turns 96 in April, has missed two major events on the annual royal calendar that she had hoped to attend, including the Commonwealth Day service at the abbey on March 14. The queen had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but on Feb. 20 the palace announced she was experiencing mild cold-like symptoms after testing positive for the virus.  Her son and heir, Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, stood in for her at the Commonwealth ceremony, accompanied by his wife, Duchess Camilla of Cornwall, and his son and daughter-in-law, Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge.  Buckingham Palace did not say why the queen missed the Commonwealth service or why she agreed to postpone the annual Diplomatic Reception on March 2 (although the Russian invasion of Ukraine likely played a role in the latter). But if missing those events meant she was able to commemorate her first and only love in the soaring expanse of Westminster Abbey, who could blame her? In the last few weeks, the queen did appear for several in-person audiences at Windsor Castle, and on March 23, in the White Drawing Room of the castle, she welcomed artisans and leaders of the 70-year-old British craftworks company, Halcyon Days, to view a selection of the hand-painted enamel-ware trinkets and fine bone English china it has made since the 1950s.  The Tuesday service was to ""give thanks"" for Philip's ""dedication to family, Nation and  Commonwealth,"" according to an advance press release from Buckingham Palace. His extended family, dozens of foreign royals, hundreds of friends and representatives of his numerous charities and patronages wanted to celebrate his legacy in creating opportunities for young people, promoting conservation and environmental stewardship, and supporting the Armed Forces. His contributions to public life were recognized as will his steadfast support for more than 700 charitable organizations with which he was associated throughout his life.  Members of the royal family who attended included some of his 12 great-grandchildren, such as future king Prince George of Cambridge, 8, and his sister, Princess Charlotte, 6, the two eldest children of Prince William and Duchess Kate. Leading the senior royals were the Prince of Wales and his wife, Duchess Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prince Andrew and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie and their husbands were there, as were the queen's only daughter, Princess Anne the Princess Royal and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, the princess' two children and her eldest grandchildren. The queen's youngest son, Prince Edward the Earl of Wessex and his wife, Countess Sophie of Wessex, and their children, Lady Louise Windsor-Mountbatten and James, Viscount Severn, were there, as were the queen's cousins, the Duke of Kent, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, and Princess Alexandra. (Prince Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, and his wife, Duchess Meghan of Sussex, did not attend; they now live in California and he declined to return to the U.K. due to concerns over security.) Besides the duke's British family, other attendees included members of eight European royal families, including the kings and queens of Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, most of whom are related to Philip and the British royals as descendants of Queen Victoria.   Representatives of European former royal families, such as those from Romania, Serbia and Greece (the latter ex-royals include Prince Philip's closest birth-family relatives) also attended.   Also attending were some 500 representatives of the duke's patronages and charities, reflecting the breadth of causes he championed and in recognition of those who continue his prodigious charitable work.  Representatives of the government, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson; the Armed Forces; the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the high commissioners of the queen's 14 other realms; and representatives of the Overseas Territories will be there, as will representatives from the royal households, the duke’s regimental affiliations in the U.K. and the Commonwealth. Top leaders of the Church of England, including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the deans of Westminster and Windsor, led the service. Representatives of other faiths in the U.K. also were there. The Right Reverend David Conner, Dean of Windsor, gave the address, quoting from the Puritan writer John Bunyan about how man's first intent is to ""be a pilgrim."" ""We do not understand the (prince) unless we see him, at the heart, to be a man of faith,"" Conner said. ""That faith was never dogmatic, sentimental or paraded and, as it went in search of understanding, was frequently questioned and examined. However, it was real and it endured, inspiring and shaping a lifetime of commitment to the making of this world a better place."" The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, founded by Prince Philip in 1956, featured prominently in the service with a tribute by Doyin Sonibare, a Gold Award winner who grew up in East London, the child of a ""strict"" Nigerian mother who encouraged her to apply to the award program as a teen. Sonibare told the congregation it changed her life for the better.  ""In 1956, when the Duke of Edinburgh created the Award, he had a vision to create a program which supported the development of young people all over the world,"" she said. ""Today, you’ve learned how his legacy has impacted me and how it will continue to impact future generations to come."" The Band of the Royal Marines (the duke was Captain General for more than 60 years) provided music before and after the service, and the Westminster Abbey and Chapel Royal choirs provided song during the service. The duke asked that clergy from the royal estates of Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral (known as the queen's domestic chaplains) be at his funeral given his role in the day-to-day management of the estates. The minister of Crathie Church in Scotland, the rector of Sandringham and the chaplain to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park will offer prayers celebrating Prince Philip's energy and spirit of adventure, the palace said. Among the composers on the list of musical excerpts were Bach, Wagner,Beethoven, Britten and Hans Zimmer, who won an Oscar Sunday for best original score for the music of “Dune.” The service was broadcast live on BBC One .The abbey was wired with a ""hearing loop,"" featuring a hearing aid so that attendees could hear better in the vast space.  Attendees were asked to switch off their devices and to refrain from using cameras, video or recording equipment.  Contributing: The Associated Press"

The Short List is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe to the newsletter here or text messages here. The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that people ages 50 and up are eligible to get a second booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine at least four months after their first booster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to approve the additional booster dose before it becomes available, and it’s not yet clear how soon that may happen. FDA officials said analysis of recent data shows a second booster of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines improves protection against severe COVID-19, although some experts question the necessity of a fourth dose. Whether or not to get another booster shot is up to individuals and should be calculated based on age, health status and the state of the pandemic, experts said. Russia and Ukraine commenced face-to-face talks Tuesday as the United Nations pushed for a cease-fire in Russia’s deadly invasion. The talks occurred in the Turkish presidential office in Istanbul and lasted more than three hours, Russian media reported. Russian officials said Tuesday that the Russian military had “drastically” cut back activity near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv as talks entered the “practical” stage. The reductions in military actions were meant to foster trust and further negotiations, Russian officials said, while the Ukrainian delegation presented a new system of security guarantees. Russia’s chief negotiator said a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy could occur as soon as a framework for a peace deal is established. 👉More news: Tuesday's latest updates.

The special House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol received former President Donald Trump’s phone log from that day – but the records show a gap of more than seven hours, according to reports. The lag in phone activity specifically occurs during the period of time during which the Capitol was ambushed, leaving the committee with no documentation of the former president’s calls during the attack. The National Archives provided the records to the committee earlier this year, and the investigators are determining whether Trump used burner phones or aides’ phones amid the attack.

The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that people ages 50 and up are eligible to get a second booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine at least four months after their first booster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has to approve the additional booster dose before it becomes available, and it’s not yet clear how soon that may happen. FDA officials said analysis of recent data shows a second booster of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines improves protection against severe COVID-19, although some experts question the necessity of a fourth dose. Whether or not to get another booster shot is up to individuals and should be calculated based on age, health status and the state of the pandemic, experts said. Russia and Ukraine commenced face-to-face talks Tuesday as the United Nations pushed for a cease-fire in Russia’s deadly invasion. The talks occurred in the Turkish presidential office in Istanbul and lasted more than three hours, Russian media reported. Russian officials said Tuesday that the Russian military had “drastically” cut back activity near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv as talks entered the “practical” stage. The reductions in military actions were meant to foster trust and further negotiations, Russian officials said, while the Ukrainian delegation presented a new system of security guarantees. Russia’s chief negotiator said a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy could occur as soon as a framework for a peace deal is established. 👉More news: Tuesday's latest updates.

The special House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol received former President Donald Trump’s phone log from that day – but the records show a gap of more than seven hours, according to reports. The lag in phone activity specifically occurs during the period of time during which the Capitol was ambushed, leaving the committee with no documentation of the former president’s calls during the attack. The National Archives provided the records to the committee earlier this year, and the investigators are determining whether Trump used burner phones or aides’ phones amid the attack.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 29th of March 2022. Today, face to face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, plus access to electric vehicles in low income areas, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Face to face peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to be held today in Turkey. The Kremlin lowered expectations before the meeting saying there had been no major breakthroughs in talks so far. But a Russian spokesperson admitted that in person meetings could lead to stronger talks. Still, Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov is rejecting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appeal to meet president Vladimir Putin, saying it would be counterproductive until the two countries get closer on key issues. Turkish president Recep Erdogan is calling for a cease fire ahead of the meeting in his country. And UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres launched an initiative to explore the possibility of a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine. Antonio Guterres: Since the beginning of the Russian invasion one months ago, the war has led to the senseless loss of thousands of lives, the displacement of 10 million people, mainly women and children, the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide. This must stop. Ahead of the Istanbul talks, Ukraine's Zelenskyy said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality as Moscow has demanded. Meanwhile, inside Ukraine, it appears that Ukrainian forces have retaken two towns, the Kyiv suburb of Irpin and Trostyanets in the country's east. In the latter, residents greeted Ukrainian troops, driving tanks through town. And one resident said this was local's reactions. Taylor Wilson translating for Trostyanets resident: ""Residents said they were glad to see the Russians leave after fierce fighting."" US officials say Russian forces appear to be in defensive positions around the capital of Kyiv and appear to be making little progress on the ground nationwide. Still, Russia is shelling from the air and sea and a cyber attack knocked Ukraine's national telecommunications provider, Ukrtelecom, almost completely offline yesterday. A Ukrainian communication official blamed the enemy without specifically mentioning Russia. Low income areas and many communities of color face barriers when it comes to accessing electric vehicles, but climate justice programs aim to close that gap. National Correspondent Bill Kaveney reports. Bill Kaveney: I think electric vehicles started with the kind of wealthier demographics, people who could afford the higher prices. There tends to be some early adoption in those areas. I think the prices were very high and I think those were the people that could afford it. I think over time, they're seeing that if we're going to have a conversion to electric to get away from fossil fuels, that you have to have everybody involved and low and moderate income people have to be part of it. One other thing I wanted to mention related to that is that the lower income people and neighborhoods often tend to suffer more from the effects of pollution due to things like historical housing discrimination, living near highways, industrial areas. So in a health way, they need it in some ways, even more than other areas. There's various groups approaching it on a lot of levels. There's groups that favor electric transportation, there's climate change groups, there's group seeking racial equity. Because...and I should mention economically disadvantaged people are affected. But communities of color, even regardless of socioeconomic status, even if well off, there hasn't been the reach into those communities as strongly say with affluent white people, and there needs to be more effort there. To that end, there are programs going on with a lot of these different groups - climate, racial justice, even EV car users who are people of color - to have some experts who can model the behavior and also share with others that are doing pilot programs, that are doing partnering efforts, to, in some cases, provide ride sharing opportunities. That's a program being done in a Black, low income neighborhood at a senior center in St. Louis, to have rental programs at a subsidized rate. That's being done at a housing project near the port of Los Angeles, which has very high pollution. And there's also alternative forms of transportation programs. There's an e-bike program in Austin that's adjacent to a housing authority project, and people there are being encouraged to use it for applicable trips. So a lot of these are smaller programs, but there's the hope to learn from them and then be able to scale them up. Also in the federal infrastructure legislation, there's, I believe about two and a half billion dollars slated to go toward these types of things, charging stations in particular for low and moderate income neighborhoods. Check out Bill's full piece in today's episode description. Parts of Interstate 81 will remain closed today in Pennsylvania, after a fiery collision with more than 50 vehicles left at least three people dead yesterday. [Sound of vehicle colliding with vehicle] Man on Interstate 81: Good God. Woman on Interstate 81: Did you hear that? Schuylkill County Coroner, Dr. David J. Moylan said he expects the death toll could rise because the search at the scene was not yet completed due to burning vehicles. The crash came at around 10:30 AM local time yesterday near Minersville, about a hundred miles Northwest of Philadelphia. And about 20 people have been sent to hospitals with injuries. Footage uploaded to so social media showed multiple crashes, including an out of control tractor trailer that smashed into a large dump truck, turning it nearly 180 degrees. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a copyright dispute over several images created in the 1980s by the iconic artist Andy Warhol, portraying the musician Prince. Supreme Court Correspondent John Fritze has more. John Fritze: Normally, we don't care all that much about copyright cases. The Supreme Court gets quite a few of them and they tend to be pretty boring, but you know, they don't usually involve clients like Andy Warhol and dealing with Prince the musician. So this is a case that deals with a photograph that a pretty well known photographer of rock and roll musicians took in 1981 of Prince that later, Andy Warhol was commissioned to do a piece of art. And he relied on this photograph, he altered it. He sort of changed the colors on it. It focused differently. It was cropped differently, but he relied on this photograph. And so the question is, in the case, did the image and the artwork that Warhol created, did that deviate enough? Did it have it's own message different and separate and distinct from the photographer's image or was it a copyright infringement? And it's an interesting case because of its clients, obviously the people involved. It's also interesting because this comes up a lot, including in the news business. It's a fair use issue that comes up a lot in the copyright context. Just how much do you have to alter someone else's image to make it your own? And that's really what's an issue in this case. The way we usually think about copyright and the idea of fair use is that if you are creating an image that is distinct, that is separate, that maybe had a reference to an earlier image, but that creates its own viewpoint, that it is permissible. It's a fair use of that material. What the Second Circuit came along and said in this case, the appeals court said was that, ""Nah, sorry, this is too close to the original image from the photographer."" And so the Warhol Foundation is suggesting, look, if you go with that precedent, if you go with that idea from the Second Circuit, that upends all sorts of things, including by the way, other images created by Warhol, right? Warhol was famous for taking some of these images and putting them in succession and changing the color and putting his own imprint on some of these famous images. And what they're saying is that's a problem for Warhol and many other artists that use some of this other material as reference points in their own work. So it's an issue now because the photographer said she wasn't aware of it until after Prince's death in 2016. And it was at that time that Warhol's art got a little more attention. Apparently there was some auctioning off of this artwork for pretty big sums of money. And so the photographer says that she became aware of this only after Prince's death. And so that's why this is coming up now, even though both Prince and Andy Warhol of course have passed. For more of John's work, search Supreme Court on USATODAY.com. Congressman Don Young, the longest serving Republican in the US House of Representatives, will lie in state in the US Capitol today. Young was first elected to the House in 1970. He was elected in 2020 to serve his 25th term as Alaska's only member. He arrived in Alaska in 1959 from California - the same year Alaska became a state - and credited Jack London's ""Call of the Wild,"" which his father used to read to him, with drawing him there. He held a number of jobs in Alaska before getting into politics, ranging from mining gold, to trapping and even teaching fifth grade. As a politician, he branded himself a conservative and fought for the trans Alaska pipeline and other projects that drew criticisms from environmental groups, though that pipeline became a major economic lifeline for the state. In 2014, the House Ethics Committee found Young violated House rules by using campaign funds for personal trips and accepting improper gifts. But despite that, voters kept sending Young back to Washington, something he did not take for granted. He said in 2016, ""Alaskans have been generous in their support for me because they know I get the job done. I'll defend my state to the dying breath."" Don Young died earlier this month at the age of 88. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. We're here seven mornings a week on whatever your favorite podcast app is.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Wednesday, March 30, as Russia's invasion continues. The Russian military said Tuesday that it had ""drastically"" reduced its activity near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv as talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the war entered the “practical” stage. Russia and Ukraine held face-to-face talks Tuesday in Turkey as the United Nations pressed for a cease-fire in Russia's brutal invasion. The talks took place in the Turkish presidential office in Istanbul and lasted more than three hours, Russia's Tass agency reported. Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy minister of defense, said the military cutbacks were made to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.” President Joe Biden, who had a call with European leaders Tuesday morning to discuss aiding Ukraine and pressuring Russia to end the war, was asked about the Russian claim of a military cutback near Kyiv. ""We'll see,'' he said. The Pentagon sounded even more skeptical, as press secretary John Kirby said the pullout of troops was small and they may be reassigned. ""We're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,'' Kirby said in a news briefing. ""We think what they probably had in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.'' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed mistrust in “the words coming from representatives of the country that continues fighting to destroy us,” pointing out that although the direction of the current peace talks is positive, it ""can’t silence explosions of Russian shells.” Ukraine’s military said it had detected withdrawals around the cities, and U.S. Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of the U.S. European Command, said that is “exactly what we see.” The Russian advance on Kyiv had stalled in recent weeks, but missile strikes have battered the city and left shortages of food, water and other necessities for a population of almost 3 million people.

Negotiations for a cease-fire being held in Turkey are expected to continue Wednesday. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arahamiya, said his side presented an official proposal for a new system of security guarantees. The proposed security pledge will not apply to the parts of Ukraine whose status remains in dispute – Crimea, which Russia considers its territory after annexing it in 2014, and the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk areas. ""We insist that it be an international treaty signed by all security guarantors who ratify,"" Arahamiya said. ""We want it to be an international mechanism of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine."" Lead Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Ukraine pledged not to join any military alliance and not to host foreign military bases or foreign troops. Even military exercises would require prior approval from guarantors, according to the proposal. Kyiv also pledged not to seek to obtain weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, Medinsky said. In return, Ukraine requires that Russia will not object to Ukraine joining the EU one day. Zelenskyy has said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and was open to working out a compromise over the contested eastern region of Donbas over the next 15 years. Latest developments ►Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Wednesday as talks on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine appeared to make progress. Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced, while Tokyo declined. Oil prices advanced less than $1 per barrel. ►The White House denied “disinformation” claims by Russia that the U.S. government is launching cyber operations against Moscow that include the theft of personal data and the spreading of false information about the Russian military. ►The Pentagon is sending a 200-person Marine Corps command-and-control unit to Lithuania, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday.

We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting.” Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy minister of defense, said Russia has “drastically” reduced its military activity near Kyiv and Chernigov amid talks with Ukraine on a peace deal.

While small numbers of Russian troops have moved back from positions around the Ukrainian capital, the Pentagon believes it is repositioning, not a real withdrawal, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. “It’s not anywhere near a majority of what they have arrayed against Kyiv,” Kirby said. The Russians still have a significant majority of their combat power near Kyiv, Kirby said. President Vladimir Putin massed more than 150,000 troops for the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have retaken territory from the Russians west of Kyiv, Kirby said. To the east of Kyiv, the Ukrainians have pushed back Russian forces to more than 30 miles from the city. It’s too early to judge what Russia will do next, Kirby said, but its aims have been clear. “Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv,” Kirby said. “It’s failed in its objective of subjugating Ukraine.” The British Defense Ministry Intelligence agreed the Russians have almost certainly failed in their effort to encircle Kyiv after repeated setbacks and counterattacks by Ukrainian forces. Russian statements and reports that some units have left “may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region,” according to a statement from Mick Smeath, Britain’s defense attache. The Pentagon’s assessment that Russia is repositioning its forces is based in part on the shift of their military focus on eastern Ukraine, Kirby said. “We’re not taking anything they say at face value,” Kirby said. — Tom Vanden Brook Whether it stems from increased confidence in their military, an inability to flee or a desire to stay and fight, the flow of Ukrainians leaving the country nearly five weeks into the Russian invasion has slowed significantly. Most of the 3.9 million refugees departed from Ukraine in early March, at a time when about 140,000 people were escaping into Poland every 24 hours.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Wednesday, March 30, as Russia's invasion continues. The Russian military said Tuesday that it had ""drastically"" reduced its activity near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv as talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the war entered the “practical” stage. Russia and Ukraine held face-to-face talks Tuesday in Turkey as the United Nations pressed for a cease-fire in Russia's brutal invasion. The talks took place in the Turkish presidential office in Istanbul and lasted more than three hours, Russia's Tass agency reported. Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy minister of defense, said the military cutbacks were made to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.” President Joe Biden, who had a call with European leaders Tuesday morning to discuss aiding Ukraine and pressuring Russia to end the war, was asked about the Russian claim of a military cutback near Kyiv. ""We'll see,'' he said. The Pentagon sounded even more skeptical, as press secretary John Kirby said the pullout of troops was small and they may be reassigned. ""We're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,'' Kirby said in a news briefing. ""We think what they probably had in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.'' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed mistrust in “the words coming from representatives of the country that continues fighting to destroy us,” pointing out that although the direction of the current peace talks is positive, it ""can’t silence explosions of Russian shells.” Ukraine’s military said it had detected withdrawals around the cities, and U.S. Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of the U.S. European Command, said that is “exactly what we see.” The Russian advance on Kyiv had stalled in recent weeks, but missile strikes have battered the city and left shortages of food, water and other necessities for a population of almost 3 million people.

Negotiations for a cease-fire being held in Turkey are expected to continue Wednesday. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arahamiya, said his side presented an official proposal for a new system of security guarantees. The proposed security pledge will not apply to the parts of Ukraine whose status remains in dispute – Crimea, which Russia considers its territory after annexing it in 2014, and the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk areas. ""We insist that it be an international treaty signed by all security guarantors who ratify,"" Arahamiya said. ""We want it to be an international mechanism of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine."" Lead Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Ukraine pledged not to join any military alliance and not to host foreign military bases or foreign troops. Even military exercises would require prior approval from guarantors, according to the proposal. Kyiv also pledged not to seek to obtain weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, Medinsky said. In return, Ukraine requires that Russia will not object to Ukraine joining the EU one day. Zelenskyy has said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and was open to working out a compromise over the contested eastern region of Donbas over the next 15 years.

PALANCA, Moldova – The number of refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dropped dramatically, driven at least in part by social media posts and news coverage suggesting to Ukrainian civilians that their military is winning. More than 3.9 million Ukrainians have fled the country, according to the United Nations; most of those refugees crossed the border in early March. As the conflict drags on, many Ukrainians say they're committed to their homeland, and the flood of refugees has slowed even as the fighting continues. Tuesday, a Russian missile slammed into a nine-story government building in Mykolaiv, killing nine people, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian military said it had drastically reduced its activity near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital – an assertion U.S. officials greeted with skepticism. “We are ready. We expect that Russia will come. And we will fight,"" said Odesa resident Alex Kobzev, 44, who coordinates aid distribution. “We are supposed to be all brothers, but we did not invite them here."" Ukrainian women and children are free to leave the country, but men of fighting age must remain. While Mykolaiv is eerily deserted except for soldiers, police officers and firefighters, Odesa remains largely functional, its shops and cafes open. Children play with dogs and kick soccer balls or walk with their families, and the electric trolleys are running. At the height of the evacuations in early March, about 140,000 people fled across the Polish border every 24 hours. Now, about 30,000 refugees arrive per day in Poland, according to U.N. data. In Moldova, daily refugee counts topped out at about 20,000 refugees per day in early March. It's dropped to about 2,000 per day, according to border officials, and 21,000 refugees have actually gone back home. Odesa resident Natasha Mala, 47, said she's not scared: “Nyet. We believe in the Ukrainian army, and we don’t want to be a part of Russia.” 'We are that united family': Russia's war uproots Ukrainian Jews amid false Nazi claims The city's residents have hardened their homes against attacks, taking down street signs to make navigation harder for Russian invaders and welding star-shaped vehicle barriers from railroad tracks along major roads. Around the city, billboards blare a message to the invaders: ""Russian soldiers and sailors, go home."" Even  though the refugee numbers are dipping, the overall tally is staggering: Nearly 4 million refugees have been forced to flee the country in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, according to the U.N. refugee agency. An additional 6.5 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced, the United Nations said. Experts said the surges and slowdowns in refugee evacuations is typical. Many of the first to leave were people with money and vehicles, especially those with savings or remote-work jobs. Aid groups whisked thousands of orphans to safety early on. Left behind are the elderly and the poor, people who lack the resources to leave their homes and vehicles, potentially forever. Stephanie Nawyn, a Michigan State University associate professor of sociology and expert on forced migration, said it makes sense that refugee flows from Ukraine would slow more than a month into the war. “What we have now maybe are people who are mostly stuck,” Nawyn said. “The shelling is happening more in certain places in Ukraine than others, so there’s people that maybe are staying put because they don’t know if the fighting is going to make it to them. But I don’t think we’re done seeing refugees (and) asylum seekers from Ukraine until Russia is done attacking.” 'Sirena, sirena, sirena!' Tense, fearful days in Odesa as Ukraine residents worry about Russian advances At shelters in Moldova's capital of Chisinau, managers report a steady stream of refugees seeking help, but those arriving now come by bus, not personal car, suggesting the newcomers have less money. Complicating matters, the early arrivals who had savings snapped up hotel rooms, apartments and Airbnbs in Chisinau, tightening the market for later arrivals. Experts said even if Odesa and Mykolaiv remain mostly untouched, the constant fear and daily air raid sirens may build up until some people reach a breaking point and they decide to risk the unknown. Many Ukrainians interviewed by USA TODAY on both sides of the border said viral Twitter and TikTok videos of soldiers destroying Russian tanks and farmers towing them away indicate Russia's invasion is failing. Others cited group chats on the Telegram messaging app as a valuable source of information, inspiration and daily military movement updates. “Every day, I talk with my friends who are soldiers. They say in two or three weeks, there will be victory,"" said Mykolaiv resident Suliman Altinsoy, 39, who was in Turkey when the war began. In Chisinau, shelter managers said there's little to indicate the war will end soon.  “For many, many people, those who are staying in Moldova, they want to be close to home and return when it’s possible. And it’s important that they retain that hope,"" said Conor O’Loughlin, the lead coordinator of emergency refugee services in Moldova for Catholic Relief Services. ""There’s a huge level of anxiety and concern for the future. Whatever we can do to provide reassurance is a huge step.” Ukraine news:Sign up to get the latest updates on the Ukraine-Russia crisis delivered to your inbox At the Moldova-Ukraine border, Altinsoy waited in his Mercedes sedan for his wife to bring her parents and their three dogs across. The family lives part-time in Turkey, and Altinsoy was torn between going to their home in Mykolaiv or returning to Turkey where his young son lives. ""If we didn’t have our son in Turkey, we would go back, too. Our house is there. Our work is there,"" Altinsoy said. “The Russian people thought our army was very weak. But the whole world can see that’s not true. Yes, we have had a lot of help, but we are fighting. And the one who believes will win. We believe. So we will win.""

PALANCA, Moldova – The number of refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dropped dramatically, driven at least in part by social media posts and news coverage suggesting to Ukrainian civilians that their military is winning. More than 3.9 million Ukrainians have fled the country, according to the United Nations; most of those refugees crossed the border in early March. As the conflict drags on, many Ukrainians say they're committed to their homeland, and the flood of refugees has slowed even as the fighting continues. Tuesday, a Russian missile slammed into a nine-story government building in Mykolaiv, killing nine people, according to Ukrainian officials. The Russian military said it had drastically reduced its activity near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital – an assertion U.S. officials greeted with skepticism. “We are ready. We expect that Russia will come. And we will fight,"" said Odesa resident Alex Kobzev, 44, who coordinates aid distribution. “We are supposed to be all brothers, but we did not invite them here."" Ukrainian women and children are free to leave the country, but men of fighting age must remain. While Mykolaiv is eerily deserted except for soldiers, police officers and firefighters, Odesa remains largely functional, its shops and cafes open. Children play with dogs and kick soccer balls or walk with their families, and the electric trolleys are running. At the height of the evacuations in early March, about 140,000 people fled across the Polish border every 24 hours. Now, about 30,000 refugees arrive per day in Poland, according to U.N. data. In Moldova, daily refugee counts topped out at about 20,000 refugees per day in early March. It's dropped to about 2,000 per day, according to border officials, and 21,000 refugees have actually gone back home. Odesa resident Natasha Mala, 47, said she's not scared: “Nyet. We believe in the Ukrainian army, and we don’t want to be a part of Russia.” 'We are that united family': Russia's war uproots Ukrainian Jews amid false Nazi claims The city's residents have hardened their homes against attacks, taking down street signs to make navigation harder for Russian invaders and welding star-shaped vehicle barriers from railroad tracks along major roads. Around the city, billboards blare a message to the invaders: ""Russian soldiers and sailors, go home."" Even  though the refugee numbers are dipping, the overall tally is staggering: Nearly 4 million refugees have been forced to flee the country in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, according to the U.N. refugee agency. An additional 6.5 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced, the United Nations said. Experts said the surges and slowdowns in refugee evacuations is typical. Many of the first to leave were people with money and vehicles, especially those with savings or remote-work jobs. Aid groups whisked thousands of orphans to safety early on. Left behind are the elderly and the poor, people who lack the resources to leave their homes and vehicles, potentially forever. Stephanie Nawyn, a Michigan State University associate professor of sociology and expert on forced migration, said it makes sense that refugee flows from Ukraine would slow more than a month into the war. “What we have now maybe are people who are mostly stuck,” Nawyn said. “The shelling is happening more in certain places in Ukraine than others, so there’s people that maybe are staying put because they don’t know if the fighting is going to make it to them. But I don’t think we’re done seeing refugees (and) asylum seekers from Ukraine until Russia is done attacking.” 'Sirena, sirena, sirena!' Tense, fearful days in Odesa as Ukraine residents worry about Russian advances At shelters in Moldova's capital of Chisinau, managers report a steady stream of refugees seeking help, but those arriving now come by bus, not personal car, suggesting the newcomers have less money. Complicating matters, the early arrivals who had savings snapped up hotel rooms, apartments and Airbnbs in Chisinau, tightening the market for later arrivals. Experts said even if Odesa and Mykolaiv remain mostly untouched, the constant fear and daily air raid sirens may build up until some people reach a breaking point and they decide to risk the unknown. Many Ukrainians interviewed by USA TODAY on both sides of the border said viral Twitter and TikTok videos of soldiers destroying Russian tanks and farmers towing them away indicate Russia's invasion is failing. Others cited group chats on the Telegram messaging app as a valuable source of information, inspiration and daily military movement updates. “Every day, I talk with my friends who are soldiers. They say in two or three weeks, there will be victory,"" said Mykolaiv resident Suliman Altinsoy, 39, who was in Turkey when the war began. In Chisinau, shelter managers said there's little to indicate the war will end soon.  “For many, many people, those who are staying in Moldova, they want to be close to home and return when it’s possible. And it’s important that they retain that hope,"" said Conor O’Loughlin, the lead coordinator of emergency refugee services in Moldova for Catholic Relief Services. ""There’s a huge level of anxiety and concern for the future. Whatever we can do to provide reassurance is a huge step.” Ukraine news:Sign up to get the latest updates on the Ukraine-Russia crisis delivered to your inbox At the Moldova-Ukraine border, Altinsoy waited in his Mercedes sedan for his wife to bring her parents and their three dogs across. The family lives part-time in Turkey, and Altinsoy was torn between going to their home in Mykolaiv or returning to Turkey where his young son lives. ""If we didn’t have our son in Turkey, we would go back, too. Our house is there. Our work is there,"" Altinsoy said. “The Russian people thought our army was very weak. But the whole world can see that’s not true. Yes, we have had a lot of help, but we are fighting. And the one who believes will win. We believe. So we will win.""

There's lots to share on the Jan. 6 panel today:  A federal judge said the ""illegality"" of former President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election was ""obvious."" U.S. District Judge David Carter ruled Monday that Trump likely “corruptly attempted to obstruct” Congress from certifying the 2020 election. In approving the transfer of emails belonging to John Eastman — an attorney for Trump — to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, Carter wrote that “Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” Charles Burnham, one of Eastman’s lawyers, issued a statement Monday saying Eastman intends to comply with the decision. Eastman wrote a six-page memo for Trump explaining a potential strategy for overturning the election. He allegedly met with former Vice President Mike Pence's staff on Jan. 5, 2021 to ask him to ""reject the electors” by refusing to recognize Electoral College votes from states with contested results.

Biden requested a $5.8 trillion budget from Congress for the 2023 fiscal year, which begins in October, that includes $1.6 billion on discretionary programs, a 7% increase over the current year. The linchpin is a ""minimum tax on billionaires"" that targets roughly the country's highest 700 earners. Why does Biden have a budget? Although Congress decides federal government spending, the president's budget reflects his priorities as Democrats face an uphill fight to retain control of the House and Senate during November's midterm elections. Biden's reinvigorated domestic agenda comes as much of his focus has been overseas on the crisis in Ukraine and after his Build Back Better domestic program stalled in Congress over the winter. Refunding the police: Biden's budget includes $30 billion in mandatory funding for law enforcement, including police departments, as well as $3.2 billion for local and state grants to support police. Deficit reduction: The White House projects Biden's budget would decrease the deficit by $1 trillion over the next 10 years; however, that's contingent on passage of the plan to increase taxes on billionaires.

As Americans continue to face higher prices at the pump, some social media users have claimed the prices are less about the invasion than actions of  President Joe Biden. “The price of crude oil increased 513% between the moment Biden took office and Putin invaded Ukraine,” reads a March 8 Facebook post from the page President Trump Fans than accumulated more than 1,800 interactions in a couple weeks. “It has increased 25% since the invasion. The price you’re paying at the pump is Biden’s fault, not Putin’s.” The text is a screenshot of a March 8 tweet from Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point USA.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, March 31, as Russia's invasion continues. Some Russian military units suffering heavy losses in Ukraine have been forced to return home or to Belarus to resupply, placing additional pressure on Russia's already strained logistics, the British Defense Ministry said in an assessment Wednesday. The problems demonstrate the difficulties Russia is having reorganizing its units in forward areas within Ukraine, the assessment says. Moscow will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground-force capability ""through mass artillery and missile strikes,"" the assessment says. President Joe Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, informing him the United States intends to provide the Ukrainian government with another $500 million in aid, the White House said. Russia this week announced plans to dial back its military activity in and around Kyiv, but Ukraine authorities say the city continues to be battered by artillery assaults, and the Pentagon said less than 20% of the forces have been removed. Russian military leaders have said forces would focus on ""liberating"" the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. ""Russia’s stated focus on an offensive in Donetsk and Luhansk is likely a tacit admission that it is struggling to sustain more than one significant axis of advance,"" the British assessment says.

Latest developments ►The U.N. food chief warned that the war in Ukraine has created “a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe” and will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II” because many of the Ukrainian farmers who produce a significant amount of the world’s wheat are now fighting Russians. ►Poland announced steps to end all Russian oil imports by year's end after banning coal imports earlier this week. Meanwhile, the German government said it received assurances from Russia that European companies won’t have to pay for Russian gas in rubles, a prospect that had raised fears Russia could cut them off.  ►Over 4 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, about 10% of the population, a United Nations refugee agency says. ►More than 80 attacks on medical workers and patients during Russia's invasion have resulted in at least 72 deaths and 43 injuries, the World Health Organization said. ►Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have reached out to their Russian counterparts who have “not answered and they have not replied with a willingness to do so,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. President Joe Biden is preparing to order the release of up to 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve, according to two people familiar with the decision, in a bid to control energy prices that have spiked as the U.S. and allies have imposed steep sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine The announcement could come as soon as Thursday, when the White House says Biden is planning to deliver remarks on his administration’s plans to combat rising gas prices. The duration of the release hasn’t been finalized but could last for several months. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the decision. High oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden. The president has seen his popularity sink as inflation reached a 40-year high in February and the cost of petroleum and gasoline climbed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Crude oil on Wednesday traded at nearly $105 a barrel, up from about $60 a year ago. Read more. Less than 20% of the forces that Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed to assault Kyiv have been moved away from the Ukrainian capital, some of them relocated to neighboring Belarus, a Pentagon press secretary said Wednesday. None of the troops have been sent to their home garrisons in Russia, Kirby said. Instead, they appear headed to Belarus for “refit and repurposing for future operations in Ukraine.” The assessment contradicts Russian claims that it is withdrawing some of its forces near Kyiv to lower tensions. Kyiv is still being hit by artillery and air strikes, Kirby said, adding that if Russia is serious about reducing tensions, commanders should send their troops home. In the northern city of Chernihiv, less than 100 miles from Kyiv, city council secretary Olexander Lomako said the Russians had actually intensified their military action and their announcement turned out to be “a complete lie.” Kirby said the Pentagon concurs with an assessment that Russian military leaders do not appear to be keeping Putin fully informed about setbacks in the war. Kirby called the assessment “disconcerting.” “If he’s not fully informed of how poorly he’s doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement that is enduring, certainly one that respects Ukrainian sovereignty?” Kirby said. -- Tom Vanden Brook President Joe Biden pledged an additional $500 million in aid to Ukraine in a phone call Wednesday with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have failed to produce a breakthrough. The White House confirmed the additional ""direct budgetary aid'' after Biden spoke to Zelenskyy for about an hour in a call that concluded shortly after noon ET. The infusion of new assistance is on top of $2 billion the U.S. has committed to Ukraine since Biden became president. Zelenskyy updated Biden on the status of Ukraine’s negotiations with Russia, according to the White House. It comes as the Biden administration has expressed skepticism about Russia’s stated plans to reduce military forces near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The two leaders also discussed how the U.S. is “working around the clock” to fulfill security requests by Ukraine, the White House said, and efforts with allies to identify additional assistance needed by the Ukrainian government. Zelenskyy said in a tweet they discussed their assessment of “the situation on the battlefield and the negotiating table” as well as defense support, a package of new sanctions on Russia and financial and humanitarian aid. – Joey Garrison U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about Russian forces’ performance in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. The official, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity Wednesday to discuss the recently declassified intelligence finding, said Putin has felt misled by the Russian military, leading to tension between the sides.  The findings demonstrate a “clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information” to Putin, and show that Putin’s senior advisers are ""afraid to tell him the truth,” the official said. The U.S. believes Putin is being misled not only about his military’s poor performance but also “how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because, again, his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said. President Joe Biden on Wednesday met with the parents of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who has been imprisoned in Russia since 2019. Joey and Paula Reed met in the Oval Office with Biden and some senior administration officials for more than a half hour, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for the Reed family. “During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere, and to provide all possible assistance until they and others are free and returned home to their families who are advocating so passionately for their release,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Reed’s parents are demonstrating outside the White House to raise awareness of the case. Reed was visiting his girlfriend in Russia in August 2019 when he was arrested on charges of assaulting a police officer. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. Reed has said he was intoxicated the night before his arrest after attending a birthday party. As Reed and his girlfriend drove home the next morning, Reed became nauseated and got out of the car on a busy street. According to Moscow police, after Reed was detained he grabbed the arm of a police officer driving the vehicle to the station and swerved the car to enter the lane of oncoming traffic. Reed and his family have disputed that account, pointing to video evidence that does not show the vehicle swerving. In a statement Tuesday, the Reed family said their son has recently started a hunger strike to protest a lack of medical care for possible tuberculosis while in confinement. -- Joey Garrison; The Associated Press NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei landed in a Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan after a U.S. record 355 days at the International Space Station. Vande Hei returned alongside the Russian Space Agency's Pyotr Dubrov, who also spent the past year in space, and Anton Shkaplerov. Wind blew the capsule onto its side following touchdown, and the trio emerged into the late afternoon sun one by one. Vande Hei, the last one out, grinned and waved as he was carried to a reclining chair out in the open Kazakh steppes. ""It's beautiful out here,"" said Vande Hei, who planned to return immediately to Houston with a team of NASA doctors and other staff. No significant breakthrough took place in talks with Ukraine aimed at ending Russia's invasion, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Negotiators for the two countries met for about three hours Tuesday in Istanbul, Turkey. Russia then said its military was scaling back operations around the capital of Kyiv – but U.S. and Ukrainian officials say missile attacks on the city continue unabated.  Peskov said the Kremlin will not discuss issues that are ""substantially on the negotiating table."" He said social media postings by representatives of Ukraine, including those not involved in the talks, do not contribute to successful negotiations. ""No one has stated that the parties have advanced. Who has stated that the parties have advanced?"" Peskov said, adding that none of the officials involved in the talks had described them as positive. Peskov also dismissed a Ukrainian proposal to negotiate the status of the Crimean Peninsula over the next 15 years. ""Crimea is part of the Russian Federation,"" Peskove said. Estonia wants Europe to help build Ukraine – with the money Europe is set to pay Russia for its energy. The funds should be deposited in a bank to Ukraine ""to make an immediate impact and make Russia pay for what has been done,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said Wednesday.  But there is also concern that Russia could reject any delayed payment and sell to other nations. European Union leaders have been unable to impose sanctions on Russian energy exports, fearing that such a move could hurt member states heavily reliant on Moscow's fossil fuel supplies. Liimets also stressed the importance of the EU’s commitment to cut its fossil fuel supplies from Russia by two-thirds before the end of the year, saying ""the price of military action for Russia must be very high."" Estonia, with a population of about 1.5 million people, shares a border with Russia and was a part of the Soviet Union until declaring its independence 1991. Estonia became a member of NATO in 2004. The demilitarization of Russia is ""well underway,"" Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday as the conflict in Ukraine entered its second month. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed his invasion sought only the ""demilitarization and de-Nazification"" of Ukraine. But according to Kyslytsya, Russian forces have lost over 17,000 military personnel, over 1,700 armored vehicles and almost 600 tanks in the invasion. Russia announced Tuesday that it would scale back military operations near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. But Ukrainian military officials said they distrust Russia’s announced withdrawal, and American officials remained skeptical. USA TODAY rides with Ukrainians in a convoy out of their war-ravaged homeland, crossing the border to Moldova. Some will stay there, hoping for a quick end to the war and a safe return home. Others are headed further west into the European Union, which is offering assistance and work permits to some Ukrainian refugees. Salam Aldeen, 39, drives one of the buses taking women and children to safety. Aldeen is also the founder of the international rescue nonprofit Team Humanity, which organized the convoy. Read more here. “The ones with cars have left on their own,"" Aldeen says. ""That leaves the poor people.” – Trevor Hughes Ukraine and Russia together produce 30% of the world's wheat supply. They contribute to 20% of the global maize supply, and 75 to 80% of the sunflower seed oil. Now, the war in Ukraine is threatening the global food supply, the U.N. food chief warned Tuesday. He said the global impact will be the most severe the world has seen since World War II, and that the invasion has created “a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe.” Many farmers from Ukraine, sometimes referred to as ""the breadbasket of the world,"" have left their farms and are fighting Russian soldiers amid already high food prices.  David Beasley, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that his agency had already begun cutting rations because of rising food, fuel, and shipping costs for millions of families around the world. – Celina Tebor Contributing: The Associated Press"

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 30th of March 2022. Today Russia's shifting focus in Ukraine. Plus some Americans can now get a second booster for COVID-19 and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Russia announced yesterday that it'll significantly scale back military operations near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said that Russia is cutting back military activity around the capital and also the Northern city of Chernihiv to ""increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations."" The announcement followed similar comments by Russian officials last week, but may hold more weight as it comes during in-person negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. Ukraine's delegation there laid out a framework yesterday that would see Ukraine declare itself neutral while its security would be guaranteed by other nations. Moscow's public reaction was positive and negotiations are expected to resume today. But US leaders are skeptical of Russia's claims that they'll move attention away from Western Ukraine and focus on the Eastern Donbas region. President Joe Biden said he cannot yet assess Russia's actions. Joe Biden: We'll see. I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting. There are negotiations that have begun today or not begun, continued today, one in Turkey and others. I had a meeting with the heads of state of four allies in NATO, France, Germany, the United States and Great Britain. And there seems to be a consensus of let's just see what they have to offer. We'll find out what they do. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves, and we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on. It wouldn't be the first time Russia has deceived with its public comments surrounding the invasion. Before invading, the Russian military said some units were loading equipment onto rail cars and preparing to return to their home bases after exercises. But just 10 days later, Russia invaded. For his part in one of his latest video addresses, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia cannot be trusted. He said signals from this week's negotiations are positive, but can't ""silence explosions of Russian shells."" And those explosions continue in Ukraine's southeast. Residents remain largely cut off from the outside world in Mariupol where at least hundreds, maybe thousands have already been killed. And in another Southern port city, Mykolaiv, a Russian strike hit a nine story government administration building killing at least 12 people. In that city, like around Ukraine, a network of volunteers has helped a rally around Ukraine's army. They're helping supply soldiers with makeshift bulletproof vests, clothing and other supplies. Olga Kukharenko is a violinist, though now she's a war effort volunteer. Taylor Wilson translating for Olga Kukharenko: ""I feel very comfortable. This place makes me feel needed. I know that my work is needed. I am helping our military forces, all our people, people who require our help, thus it is much better for me to be among people than to stay at home, hide than be frightened. It is not frightening here."" Tech companies around the world, from giants like Google and Microsoft to little known startups, rely on Ukrainian workers. But that's been made complicated by Russia's invasion of the country. Tech reporter Terry Collins has more. Terry Collins: I think what a lot of people don't realize is that while known companies, such as Google and Microsoft have workers based in Ukraine which has become a tech hotbed within the last decade or so. There are many far lesser known and early mid stage startups around the world that count on this embattled country's talent rich pool of engineers and developers, which now could be in jeopardy due to the conflict in Ukraine. So we're talking part through our laptops and our smartphones, a lot of them are behind some of the back end that we need and use to communicate and with many of our hardware. They start learning STEM - science, technology, engineering, and math - at a very early age compared to many parts of the world. So they come almost ready much sooner and therefore they're in much higher demand in terms of with big tech and little tech. I wrote that tech is slowly becoming a part of Ukraine's GDP. And so, as I mentioned in the story, there are a lot of companies, startups that range from early to mid stage to some even larger that. What we're seeing is that some of these companies, they're finding ways to try to keep going despite the conflict. Either they're relocating to other parts of Europe, other parts of the world, and also staying in business because their philosophy is they want to keep going, keep the country's economy going so they can pay taxes so that some of those funds could help support the army in the Ukraine to help ward off this invasion. I think one of my biggest takeaways is how some of the companies are willing to fight, fight even for their country, literally. I talked to a co-founder of a company DMarket, which specializes in gaming in the metaverse, and one of the co-founders is actually on the front lines battling in Kyiv. When I talked to him, he was in full uniform, kind of camouflaged and everything, similar to what we see Zelenskyy wearing and he was talking to me on screen just after coming off a shift and he was in uniform sitting in a gaming chair. So instead of programming and coding, he just came back from a shift on patrol. And in the background, I could see some of his weaponry, which included rifles and all sorts of artillery. So it gives you a sense of how serious this war is from another perspective and how many people are putting their lives and their livelihoods on the line to fight for their country. Severe weather is moving across the eastern half of the country this week. The Storm Prediction Center says more than 55 million people are at risk for some kind of severe weather today. That's especially true in parts of the deep south where tornadoes are possible and 20 million people are at risk across the country tomorrow. This latest round of rough weather comes after a snow squall caused a deadly pile up in Pennsylvania on Monday. Mike Moy: This is ridiculous. It's snow and fog mixed together and it made the visibility down to zero and ... oh, watch out! Watch out! Oh God! That was the voice of witness and survivor, Mike Moy. The crash on Interstate 81 in Schuylkill County involved more than 50 vehicles, including trucks that caught on fire. It killed at least three people and injured dozens more. Part of the highway remained closed yesterday. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have decided that people aged 50 and up are now eligible for a second COVID-19 booster at least four months after their first. Health reporter Karen Weintraub has more. Karen Weintraub: At this point it doesn't mean anything people under 50. It's not clear that people under 50, especially if they're healthy, if they have a normal immune system, that they would need another shot at this point. They're very good protection from the current vaccines, particularly if they've boosted. The first two doses do a really good job of keeping people out of the hospital. The third dose was very protective against omicron. Didn't prevent all disease, but it did keep people from getting very sick. And again, if you're young and healthy and vaccinated, you don't have anything to worry about at this point from COVID. But older people, people who are immune compromised really do need that extra help. No safety concerns have been raised at this point about getting a fourth dose. There are some theoretical concerns, some issues seen in animals, but nothing seen in people at this point. Theoretically, if you keep adding and boosting, at some point the immune system might overreact, but we haven't seen that yet in any of the studies that have been done to date. The one other thing I would add is that the experts I talked to emphasized that what's really important is to get the first, second and third shots, that a supplementary booster is useful again for people who are elderly or immune compromised. But healthy people really should get those earlier shots. And even if you had COVID along the way, especially if you had delta or something earlier, that it's a good idea to get those three shots to provide protection against the current variants. For Karen's full piece, check out today's episode description. The US Men's Soccer Team has done just about enough to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, almost. The US hammered Panama 5-1 on Sunday to give themselves a great chance to qualify tonight in their final group qualifier away to Costa Rica. As long as the US does not lose by six goals or more tonight, they'll qualify. If that highly unlikely scenario does happen, the absolute worst the Stars and Stripes can do is finish in fourth, which would lead to a playoff with the winner of the Oceanic playoff, New Zealand or Solomon Islands in June. Still, the US has an awful record historically in Costa Rica and in fact has never won a World Cup qualifier there. Also from the region, Mexico appears set to qualify tonight and Canada has already done so for the first time since 1986. Costa Rica will likely finish in fourth for that playoff spot. You can watch tonight's US game just after 9:00 PM Eastern time on CBS Sports Network and Paramount+. And you can find 5 Things on whatever your favorite podcast app is.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 30th of March 2022. Today Russia's shifting focus in Ukraine. Plus some Americans can now get a second booster for COVID-19 and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Russia announced yesterday that it'll significantly scale back military operations near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said that Russia is cutting back military activity around the capital and also the Northern city of Chernihiv to ""increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations."" The announcement followed similar comments by Russian officials last week, but may hold more weight as it comes during in-person negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey. Ukraine's delegation there laid out a framework yesterday that would see Ukraine declare itself neutral while its security would be guaranteed by other nations. Moscow's public reaction was positive and negotiations are expected to resume today. But US leaders are skeptical of Russia's claims that they'll move attention away from Western Ukraine and focus on the Eastern Donbas region. President Joe Biden said he cannot yet assess Russia's actions. Joe Biden: We'll see. I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting. There are negotiations that have begun today or not begun, continued today, one in Turkey and others. I had a meeting with the heads of state of four allies in NATO, France, Germany, the United States and Great Britain. And there seems to be a consensus of let's just see what they have to offer. We'll find out what they do. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves, and we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on. It wouldn't be the first time Russia has deceived with its public comments surrounding the invasion. Before invading, the Russian military said some units were loading equipment onto rail cars and preparing to return to their home bases after exercises. But just 10 days later, Russia invaded. For his part in one of his latest video addresses, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia cannot be trusted. He said signals from this week's negotiations are positive, but can't ""silence explosions of Russian shells."" And those explosions continue in Ukraine's southeast. Residents remain largely cut off from the outside world in Mariupol where at least hundreds, maybe thousands have already been killed. And in another Southern port city, Mykolaiv, a Russian strike hit a nine story government administration building killing at least 12 people. In that city, like around Ukraine, a network of volunteers has helped a rally around Ukraine's army. They're helping supply soldiers with makeshift bulletproof vests, clothing and other supplies. Olga Kukharenko is a violinist, though now she's a war effort volunteer. Taylor Wilson translating for Olga Kukharenko: ""I feel very comfortable. This place makes me feel needed. I know that my work is needed. I am helping our military forces, all our people, people who require our help, thus it is much better for me to be among people than to stay at home, hide than be frightened. It is not frightening here."" Tech companies around the world, from giants like Google and Microsoft to little known startups, rely on Ukrainian workers. But that's been made complicated by Russia's invasion of the country. Tech reporter Terry Collins has more. Terry Collins: I think what a lot of people don't realize is that while known companies, such as Google and Microsoft have workers based in Ukraine which has become a tech hotbed within the last decade or so. There are many far lesser known and early mid stage startups around the world that count on this embattled country's talent rich pool of engineers and developers, which now could be in jeopardy due to the conflict in Ukraine. So we're talking part through our laptops and our smartphones, a lot of them are behind some of the back end that we need and use to communicate and with many of our hardware. They start learning STEM - science, technology, engineering, and math - at a very early age compared to many parts of the world. So they come almost ready much sooner and therefore they're in much higher demand in terms of with big tech and little tech. I wrote that tech is slowly becoming a part of Ukraine's GDP. And so, as I mentioned in the story, there are a lot of companies, startups that range from early to mid stage to some even larger that. What we're seeing is that some of these companies, they're finding ways to try to keep going despite the conflict. Either they're relocating to other parts of Europe, other parts of the world, and also staying in business because their philosophy is they want to keep going, keep the country's economy going so they can pay taxes so that some of those funds could help support the army in the Ukraine to help ward off this invasion. I think one of my biggest takeaways is how some of the companies are willing to fight, fight even for their country, literally. I talked to a co-founder of a company DMarket, which specializes in gaming in the metaverse, and one of the co-founders is actually on the front lines battling in Kyiv. When I talked to him, he was in full uniform, kind of camouflaged and everything, similar to what we see Zelenskyy wearing and he was talking to me on screen just after coming off a shift and he was in uniform sitting in a gaming chair. So instead of programming and coding, he just came back from a shift on patrol. And in the background, I could see some of his weaponry, which included rifles and all sorts of artillery. So it gives you a sense of how serious this war is from another perspective and how many people are putting their lives and their livelihoods on the line to fight for their country. Severe weather is moving across the eastern half of the country this week. The Storm Prediction Center says more than 55 million people are at risk for some kind of severe weather today.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine – With a sharp exclamation, the driver of the blue Mercedes minibus slams on the brakes, slowing the 21-passenger vehicle hurtling though the late afternoon sun toward a military checkpoint sprawled across the road. Salam Aldeen, 39, swings open the front door, yelling hello to the soldiers guarding the barricades, ignoring the machine gun poking out from beneath camouflage netting. The soldiers' fatigues look new, but their AK-47s are battered, and many wear sneakers, not combat boots. ""Dobryi den’"" he shouts, pointing at the 21 mothers and kids inside. ""Ditey."" That word, ""children"" in Ukrainian, is stickered on the van's hood, and Aldeen's practiced interactions with the guards puts them at ease. A young soldier boards, rifle slung across his back, his eyes roaming over the wide-eyed children and nervous mothers crammed inside. He quickly checks the passports of the handful of men aboard, ensuring they're not Ukrainians fleeing the war amid a mandate that men of fighting age remain. ""Do svidaniya,"" the soldier says to the women and children escaping Russia's deadly invasion, stepping off. Goodbye. The convoy slews in an S-shape around the barricades on the main road from Mykolaiv to Odesa, children looking out at the concrete blocks sealed with expanding foam to keep the cold spring wind out. Straightening out, the blue van's driver pushes his foot to the floor, the speedometer creeping toward 60 mph along the mostly deserted two-lane road as it arrows between the fields Ukrainians farm to help feed Europe and large portions of Africa. As the evening darkens, the van's interior lights cast a blue pallor over those inside: A grandmother cradling her grandson, a bandage on his face. A college student trying to maintain her composure after kissing her boyfriend goodbye, making phone call after phone call. A mother struggling to keep two toddlers from crying, their father left behind. Live Ukraine updates:No breakthrough in peace talks, Kremlin says; Kyiv battered despite Russia saying it would roll back assault These refugees left their war-ravaged homeland to cross the border into Moldova. Some will stay there, hoping for a quick end to the war and a safe return home. Others are headed farther west into the European Union, which offers assistance and work permits to some Ukrainian refugees. More than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Russian attacks, the United Nations said.  Liliana, 24, a college student studying engineering, decided staying in Mykolaiv was no longer worth the risk. Her new passport is stiff and straight, her world limited to Ukraine and one trip to Russia as a child. Like many refugees, Liliana didn't want to give her full name, fearing Russians would target her family. “I wanted to stay, but it just wasn’t safe,"" she says. ""I was sad yesterday when I decided to leave. But I got all my crying done then."" The tear streaks in her mascara tell a different story. Like the 75 other refugees being extracted, Liliana may never return home. All across Europe, refugees of conflicts, including in Syria, have been forced to make new lives for themselves, learn new languages, find new jobs. It's a world all too familiar for Aldeen, the founder of the international rescue nonprofit Team Humanity, which organized Sunday's extrication. A veteran of refugee crises in Syria and Afghanistan, Aldeen himself is a refugee, born in Moldova to an Iraqi father and Moldovan mother. His family fled to Denmark during the Moldovan civil war and the country's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in the early 1990s. He was 9, and he remembers what it was like to lose everything. That feeling still drives him, from the waters off Greece to the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. He came home to Moldova shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, hoping for a short break. Instead, he bought the blue van, rented others, hired drivers and began rounding up donations. Though many nonprofits limit themselves to providing aid on the Ukrainian border, Aldeen and his team have made multiple risky dashes to Mykolaiv and Odesa, delivering Pampers and formula, antibiotics and drinking water. Each time, the convoys extract more and more women and children. “The ones with cars have left on their own,"" Aldeen says in the dark. ""That leaves the poor people.” Sunday's convoy left the Moldovan capital of Chisinau in the pre-dawn darkness after volunteers loaded four vans. A Ukrainian border guard permits the convoy across just after dawn, handing back passports to the volunteers and two USA TODAY journalists before gratefully accepting a package of baby wipes. The guards live at the checkpoint while their usual replacement shifts are off fighting. Ten minutes later, the convoy begins encountering Ukrainian army checkpoints, erected to slow the movement of tanks and to catch any Russian saboteurs targeting the electrical grid or other utilities. Ukraine used to depend heavily on Russia for natural gas and electricity, but the solar panels and slow-spinning wind turbines demonstrate its efforts toward energy independence. By 9:30 a.m., the convoy reaches Odesa, where families walk their dogs and women jog along the waterfront. Aldeen's team collects generators, medical supplies, wheelchairs and canned food from a cache established on a relief mission a few days before. USA TODAY was permitted to observe and report on the operation after agreeing to withhold the specific location. Alex Kobzev, 44, says the supplies will help Odesa weather Russian attacks. Although many stores remain open, border delays mean supply trucks can't refill shelves as fast as usual. The city's residents took down street signs to make navigation harder for Russian invaders, and star-shaped vehicle barriers they welded from railroad tracks are strewn along major roads. “We are ready. We expect that Russia will come. And we will fight,"" says Kobzev, who runs a nonprofit allied with Team Humanity. “We are supposed to be all brothers, but we did not invite them here.” Around the city, billboards echo that message: ""Russian soldiers and sailors go home."" Hitting the road again, the convoy winds its way east through more roadblocks as it nears Mykolaiv, where the street signs have also disappeared and soldiers in bunkers guard approaches to the city. After the supplies – including hot meals provided by World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit founded by renowned chef Jose Andres, and carried in insulated containers from Chisinau – are unloaded, the vans swing into a parking lot where women and children wait, tears in their eyes as they say goodbye to fathers and husbands and brothers. Aldeen moves with urgency – the last time they did this, Mykolaiv's air raid sirens were sounding – but it's hard to get 75 moms and kids and their suitcases loaded efficiently. After about 45 minutes, the convoy heads west, passengers sitting in near silence as the buses navigate the checkpoints. Some of the volunteers wear body armor, including the team's volunteer doctor. Aboard one bus, an elderly woman has an asthma attack, going from normal to audible wheezing in minutes. Her inhalers don't help, and the woman's daughter produces a vial of medicine and some needles, forcing Dr. Alexandra Munteanu, 35, to decide whether to find her a hospital in Ukraine or keep the convoy headed west to the safety of Moldova. They've been driving for almost an hour, and the military curfew around Mykolaiv means the shuttles must be gone before dark. Munteanu, who grew up in Romania and lives in the United Kingdom, has no practice as a combat doctor – she's accustomed to fully stocked supply cabinets, sterile hospital rooms and a team of colleagues. She tries to understand the woman's increasingly frantic Ukrainian and decide whether to run an IV into her while parked on the side of the road, a stationary target for Russian missiles. For the first time in her life, she's wearing body armor. The team didn't have enough for all the volunteers, so Aldeen gave his to Munteanu. ""Bloody hell,"" Munteanu texts a friend later. ""I didn’t even have an ambulance, let alone monitors and airway equipment. … The lady was literally getting worse by the minute. So I gave her the IV. Within 10 minutes from the IV she was OK."" The convoy hits the road again. Aldeen alternates dozing against his girlfriend's shoulder and answering his ringing cellphone in the dark, effortlessly switching languages as he consults with prospective donors, friends who might be able to provide permits or truck rentals, and fellow humanitarians offering to help. By 7 p.m., the convoy reaches the Ukrainian border, and guards come aboard to collect passports and ID cards. Team Humanity volunteers hand out the last of the food from World Central Kitchen, then Aldeen passes around lollipops for the children as they wait. European governments have relaxed travel restrictions for refugees, and the guards return with papers for the kids about 45 minutes later. Applause breaks out as the vans cross the Moldovan border. They still have a two-hour drive to Chisinau, where some refugees will find shelter. Others, including Liliana, board a bus that will take them to Germany. Aldeen plans for a return trip to Mykolaiv, which Russian fighter jets bombed Tuesday morning, destroying a building a mile from where the shuttles loaded the women and children. “It’s a risk we are taking, yes, but it’s worth it,"" Aldeen says. ""Who else will do this?"" More:Ukrainian refugees leave everything, except a few treasured items, as they flee Russian attack"

European governments have relaxed travel restrictions for refugees, and the guards return with papers for the kids about 45 minutes later. Applause breaks out as the vans cross the Moldovan border. They still have a two-hour drive to Chisinau, where some refugees will find shelter. Others, including Liliana, board a bus that will take them to Germany. Aldeen plans for a return trip to Mykolaiv, which Russian fighter jets bombed Tuesday morning, destroying a building a mile from where the shuttles loaded the women and children. “It’s a risk we are taking, yes, but it’s worth it,"" Aldeen says. ""Who else will do this?"" More:Ukrainian refugees leave everything, except a few treasured items, as they flee Russian attack"

They worried the trend could ultimately hinder patient safety. ►RaDonda Vaught case:Nashville DA says RaDonda Vaught case isn't against nursing community, nurses still worried That verdict — and the fact that Vaught was charged at all — worries patient safety and nursing groups that have worked for years to move hospital culture away from cover-ups, blame and punishment, and toward the honest reporting of mistakes. The move to a “Just Culture” seeks to improve safety by analyzing human errors and making systemic changes to prevent their recurrence. And that can’t happen if providers think they could go to prison, they say. Just Culture has been widely adopted in hospitals since a 1999 report by the National Academy of Medicine estimated at least 98,000 people may die each year due to medical errors. But such bad outcomes remain stubbornly common, with too many hospital staffers convinced that owning up to mistakes will expose them to punishment, according to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Medical Quality. ►RaDonda Vaught case:Ex-nurse RaDonda Vaught's trial reveals medication access problems at Vanderbilt in 2017 Vaught was steeped in the idea of Just Culture and says she has “zero regrets” about telling the truth, but her candor was used against her at trial. Assistant District Attorney Brittani Flatt quoted from her interview with a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agent in closing arguments: “I definitely should have paid more attention. I should have called the pharmacy. I shouldn’t have overridden, because it wasn’t an emergency.” More than 46,000 death certificates listed complications of medical and surgical care — a category that includes medical errors — among the causes of death in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. “Best estimates are 7,000-10,000 fatal medication errors a year. Are we going to lock them up? Who is going to replace them?” said Bruce Lambert, patient safety expert and director of the Center for Communication and Health at Northwestern University. “If you think RaDonda Vaught is criminally negligent, you just don’t know how health care works,” Lambert said.

She said that because Vaught owned up to the mistake, Murphey’s death “has probably saved lives.” “At my hospital, they’ve changed their policy and put paralytics into a rapid intubation kit because of this,” she said. While Murphey’s death may serve as a cautionary tale for other nurses, Vaught, now awaits her sentencing.  The District Attorney's office confirmed a conviction of reckless homicide can carry 2-4 years of incarceration, the gross neglect charge could stretch from 3-6 years. The judge will determine whether the sentences run concurrently or consecutively, based on statutory guidelines. Includes reporting from Travis Loller with the Associated Press"

I was asking myself the same thing at 4 a.m. PDT when I tuned in to the kickoff of the new streaming platform. After watching the first four live shows on the platform, the answer to Stelter’s question was clear: They were talking about Will Smith. That first show was “5 Things with Kate Bolduan.” She uttered the first words spoken on the platform: “Good morning and welcome to CNN+.” Bolduan called it a historic day, and why not? It was. I spent the bulk of the morning watching the live morning shows that make up a third of CNN+’s programming. The rest comes from CNN's massive library and moderated interactive interviews. It’s ambitious, easy to navigate and forgiving — I didn’t have to wake up so early to catch the initial broadcast; I could have streamed it later. It just seemed like the thing to do. What is CNN+:Here's what we know about the network's new streaming service Before the launch, the biggest question about CNN+ was why it was needed when the CNN network can be viewed on TV and online. After watching the first four shows airing on the platform Tuesday morning that question changed, replaced by a new one: What would they have talked about if Smith hadn’t slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars? “Big Picture with Sara Sidner” devoted its entire half-hour to it. Granted, CNN+ isn’t the only outlet talking about it. It’s a big story. But they covered this thing like the moon landing or something. “Our question today,” Sidner asked at the beginning of her show, “Is Will Smith’s apology enough?” She had guests. One of them Kierna Mayo, the former executive editor of Ebony magazine, said, “It’s a loaded question, is it enough. For whom?” Rock seems like a good place to start. But you get her point. “There’s no doubt that there’s a surreal nature to it all,” Mayo said. There certainly was when she then said this: “This is a bigger story. This is about humanity.” That’s debatable. But it’s certainly how CNN+ covered it. For Bolduan’s show, the Smith slap was No. 2 on the list of five things. The evacuation of Mariupol in Ukraine was No. 1; the FDA authorizing COVID-19 boosters for those 50 and older ranked third.  (A crash on a Pennsylvania interstate that killed three people was No. 4, and Walmart stopping cigarette sales was No. 5. Bolduan delivered her reports in a straightforward way, so much so that when she interviewed Dr. Leana Wen for the COVID-19 story, it sounded stilted when she responded to something Wen said with, “You and me both, sister.” Next up was “Go There,” in which we got reports from Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv and David Culver in Shanghai. It had a “Broadcast News” feel at the beginning and the end, with shots of the studio and audio of the director: “Kill David’s mic. Nice show everyone.” Someone in the studio relayed questions from viewers to the reporters. Then came Sidner’s show. The format was familiar but the perspective was welcome – this was a Black woman talking with Black women about the news of the day. Stelter rounded out the morning with “Reliable Sources Daily,” not to be confused with his Sunday morning show. This is kind of like a video version of his daily newsletter. He’s high energy and he hit a lot of stories, talking about them with various contributors. The first story? Did you guess Will Smith? Congratulations, you’re a winner! After 19 minutes of Smith talk, Stelter got to the Washington Post story about the seven-hour gap in Donald Trump’s phone logs from Jan. 6. There was also a report on Disney condemning Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” bill, plus a report on Ukraine. The best part of the show, and indeed the best part of morning programming, was Stelter bringing in Dave Walker and Lois Hart, the first two CNN anchors. They’re now married, and still watch. “Here’s the difference,” Walker said. “I used to anchor at CNN. Now I just yell at CNN.” Hart called anchoring back in the day “iron pants” work, a great description of having to sit in the chair for hours on end. Baldwin and Sidner joined them — the first two anchors on the new venture. “You’ll figure it out,” Hart told the CNN+ anchors. They will. Other stories will push Smith aside eventually. But not Tuesday morning. The first Gulf War helped put CNN on the map. Maybe CNN+ thinks Will Smith can help it do the same.  The afternoon lineup is a more traditional affair. On ""The Source with Kasie Hunt,"" the host interviewed Sen. Mitt Romney, and a panel discussed the Trump phone-gap story. ""The Global Brief with Bianca Nobilo"" went deep on Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine. Then came ""Who's Talking to Chris Wallace?"" Wallace's bolt from Fox News -- and his recent denunciation of its programming -- gave CNN+ the kind of publicity boost a new venture needs. Wallace plans to expand his horizons with the show beyond the Sunday-morning interviews he did at Fox News. But his first guest was William McRaven, the retired admiral; they discussed the war in Ukraine, kind of like a Sunday-morning interview. Finally, ""The Newscast with Wolf Blitzer"" was just that -- a newscast with Wolf Blitzer. (And no Will Smith stories.)"

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24, misinformation has spread widely across social media. Many of the false posts have included out-of-context images or videos claiming to show the invasion, while others have promoted Russian propaganda about the war. But fact-free allegations were baked into Russia's invasion from the beginning. ""The Kremlin is executing a massive disinformation campaign at home against its own domestic population,"" Cindy Otis, a former CIA officer and disinformation expert, told USA TODAY. In a speech prior to the invasion of Ukraine, Putin said he wanted to ""denazify"" the country. He accused the Ukrainian government of committing genocide. And he said the country planned to develop its own nuclear arsenal. ""The purpose of this operation is to protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,"" Putin said, according to a translation from the Russian Mission in Geneva. ""To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation."" Fact check roundup:What's true and what's false about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Numerous experts told USA TODAY those claims – which the Kremlin and its allies have promoted repeatedly in official statements, state news broadcasts and on social media over the recent weeks – are baseless. ""They're minimizing the war,"" Olga Lautman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told USA TODAY. ""If you read Russian press, you would think this is kind of a tiny operation and that Russia is the kindest country who's opened their borders up to take all these refugees ... which is the opposite of what we see with all the images."" USA TODAY fact-checked three prevailing claims the Kremlin has made to justify its invasion of Ukraine. We are presenting context and examining evidence but not directly rating these claims, as the situation continues to evolve. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has referred to the Ukrainian government as ""openly neo-Nazi” and “pro-Nazi,’’ phrases that strike a nerve in Russia, where citizens recall their country’s history in helping to defeat Hitler’s Nazi Germany. However, experts say Putin’s comments are a false portrayal of the Ukrainian government and distort history. ""That's an argument that's about 80 years out-of-date, historically,"" Christopher Browning, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and an expert on Nazi Germany, told USA TODAY. ""Three generations past render it mostly irrelevant."" In the 1930s, Ukrainians suffered famine under the rule of Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin. So when German troops entered Ukraine in 1941, a group that was ""not a small or insignificant"" wanted to collaborate with the Germans with the hope of achieving independence, Browning said. ""Of course, the Germans had no intention of granting them independence but were happy to exploit their wishful thinking in that regard,"" he said. More:Pro-Ukraine protesters rally across the world as Russian invasion enters second month Ukrainian police collaborated with Nazi Germany and aided in the extermination of Jews during World War II. An estimated 24 million Soviet service members and civilians died during the war – the most of any country, according to the National World War II Museum.  Nearly seven decades later, in 2014, some far-right groups participated in the Maidan Uprising in Ukraine, which the Kremlin falsely claimed was a fascist coup. And today, far-right groups like the Azov Battalion, also known as the Azov Regiment, are part of some Ukrainian volunteer battalions, according to reports by USA TODAY and other media outlets.    However, that doesn't mean Nazis control Ukraine, whose president is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust. ""This rhetoric is factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army,"" reads an open letter from dozens of Nazism and genocide scholars worldwide. In another echo of World War II, Putin claimed during his Feb. 24 speech that the Ukrainian government was responsible for ""horror and genocide"" in the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine has fought pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Russia has also accused the country of genocide in reports to the United Nations. The U.S. State Department and human rights experts say those assertions are false. ""No evidence has been produced by the Russian government to substantiate this claim,"" David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an email. ""Nor have repeated investigations by the (United Nations) High Commissioner for Human Rights produced any such evidence."" Fact check:Video shows Putin justifying military operation in Ukraine, not threatening Kenya Under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, genocide has a specific legal definition: ""Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Those acts include killing members of the group and causing serious harm to them, among others. Ukraine's armed conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Donbas does not appear to meet that definition. And if it did, as the Kremlin has claimed for years, it stands to reason there would be an increase in casualties. But data don't back that up. More:Why a 'quagmire' might be the most realistic goal of new US surge in military aid to Ukraine No reports from the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which conducts special monitoring in eastern Ukraine, indicate anything resembling genocide in Donbas. Civilian deaths in the region have actually plummeted over the past few years, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights. Governments and political leaders have long used genocide – or claims of genocide – as a justification for foreign intervention. In Russia's case, ""an additional factor is that the term intersects with the memory of the war against Nazism, which looms large in the Russian imagination,"" according to Alejandro Baer, director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota. ""Putin has exploited this memory to justify his war,"" he said in an email. ""The accusation of Ukrainians as 'Nazis' who commit 'genocide' might sound absurd to us in the West, but it strikes a chord in the Russian public."" In recent weeks, Russian media and officials have repeated Putin's accusation that Ukraine is trying to develop its own nuclear weapons. Russia has put its own nuclear forces on high alert amid the conflict. However, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal nearly 30 years ago – and there's no evidence the country is working to rebuild it. ""The argument is ridiculous, and there is absolutely no evidence to support it at all,"" former Rep. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, told USA TODAY. ""Ukraine was one of the early people to enter into the nonproliferation treaty along with a whole bunch of other countries, and it's never been found to be in contravention to its terms."" After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited thousands of nuclear arms. However, according to the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative, Ukraine ""never possessed operational control of the weapons."" Three years later, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurance from Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Fact check:A wide array of raw footage shows Russian invasion of Ukraine The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which has a broad inspection mandate in Ukraine, has refuted the notion that the country is developing nuclear weapons. And nuclear energy experts say Ukraine doesn't have the capacity to do so. ""There is no significant potential for a nuclear weapons program in Ukraine,"" Matthew Bunn, professor of the practice of energy, national security and foreign policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told USA TODAY. Ukraine has neither the material to develop nuclear weapons – such as highly enriched uranium or plutonium separated from spent fuel – nor facilities to produce those materials. Building them would take years and cost billions of dollars, Bunn said. ""There is no country in the world that has ever gotten close to nuclear weapons without the world knowing about it years ahead of time,"" he said. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

And today, far-right groups like the Azov Battalion, also known as the Azov Regiment, are part of some Ukrainian volunteer battalions, according to reports by USA TODAY and other media outlets.    However, that doesn't mean Nazis control Ukraine, whose president is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust. ""This rhetoric is factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army,"" reads an open letter from dozens of Nazism and genocide scholars worldwide. In another echo of World War II, Putin claimed during his Feb. 24 speech that the Ukrainian government was responsible for ""horror and genocide"" in the eastern Donbas region, where Ukraine has fought pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Russia has also accused the country of genocide in reports to the United Nations. The U.S. State Department and human rights experts say those assertions are false. ""No evidence has been produced by the Russian government to substantiate this claim,"" David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an email. ""Nor have repeated investigations by the (United Nations) High Commissioner for Human Rights produced any such evidence."" Fact check:Video shows Putin justifying military operation in Ukraine, not threatening Kenya Under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, genocide has a specific legal definition: ""Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Those acts include killing members of the group and causing serious harm to them, among others. Ukraine's armed conflict with pro-Russian separatists in Donbas does not appear to meet that definition. And if it did, as the Kremlin has claimed for years, it stands to reason there would be an increase in casualties. But data don't back that up. More:Why a 'quagmire' might be the most realistic goal of new US surge in military aid to Ukraine No reports from the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe, which conducts special monitoring in eastern Ukraine, indicate anything resembling genocide in Donbas. Civilian deaths in the region have actually plummeted over the past few years, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights. Governments and political leaders have long used genocide – or claims of genocide – as a justification for foreign intervention. In Russia's case, ""an additional factor is that the term intersects with the memory of the war against Nazism, which looms large in the Russian imagination,"" according to Alejandro Baer, director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota. ""Putin has exploited this memory to justify his war,"" he said in an email. ""The accusation of Ukrainians as 'Nazis' who commit 'genocide' might sound absurd to us in the West, but it strikes a chord in the Russian public."" In recent weeks, Russian media and officials have repeated Putin's accusation that Ukraine is trying to develop its own nuclear weapons. Russia has put its own nuclear forces on high alert amid the conflict. However, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal nearly 30 years ago – and there's no evidence the country is working to rebuild it. ""The argument is ridiculous, and there is absolutely no evidence to support it at all,"" former Rep. John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, told USA TODAY. ""Ukraine was one of the early people to enter into the nonproliferation treaty along with a whole bunch of other countries, and it's never been found to be in contravention to its terms."" After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited thousands of nuclear arms. However, according to the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative, Ukraine ""never possessed operational control of the weapons."" Three years later, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurance from Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Fact check:A wide array of raw footage shows Russian invasion of Ukraine The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which has a broad inspection mandate in Ukraine, has refuted the notion that the country is developing nuclear weapons. And nuclear energy experts say Ukraine doesn't have the capacity to do so. ""There is no significant potential for a nuclear weapons program in Ukraine,"" Matthew Bunn, professor of the practice of energy, national security and foreign policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told USA TODAY. Ukraine has neither the material to develop nuclear weapons – such as highly enriched uranium or plutonium separated from spent fuel – nor facilities to produce those materials. Building them would take years and cost billions of dollars, Bunn said. ""There is no country in the world that has ever gotten close to nuclear weapons without the world knowing about it years ahead of time,"" he said. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

The announcement could come as soon as Thursday, when the White House says Biden is planning to deliver remarks on his administration's plans to combat rising gas prices. The duration of the release hasn't been finalized but could last for several months. The AP's sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the decision. High oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden.

The biggest concerns were strong tornadoes, some of at least EF-2 strength, and hurricane-force wind gusts of at least 75 mph. Accuweather reported early Thursday an outbreak of severe weather is expected to be unleashed across the southern U.S. into Thursday night. Thunderstorms will linger in parts of the Southeast and Ohio Valley Thursday morning before eventually spreading from the Florida Gulf coast up through the Northeast, AccuWeather also said.   The resignation of Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., takes effect Thursday after the congressman was convicted by a California jury of lying to federal authorities about an illegal campaign donation from a foreign national. In a letter to the House of Representatives last week, Fortenberry announced he was resigning from Congress, effective March 31. Fortenberry was indicted in October after authorities said he lied to FBI agents in two interviews about his knowledge of an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Friday, April 1, as Russia's invasion continues. Russian troops have continued to retreat from Kyiv in the last 24 hours, although the withdrawal remains at about 20% of the force Russian President Vladimir Putin sent to seize the Ukrainian capital, a senior Defense official said Thursday. The Pentagon believes the Russians are pulling back to get resupplied, not to wind down the war, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal intelligence assessments. As evidence, the official pointed to continued airstrikes and shelling of Kyiv by Russian troops. President Joe Biden supported that contention later in the day, saying there have been no clear signs the Russians are relenting in their assault around the capital. The official spoke to reporters hours after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg provided the same assessment in a briefing in Brussels. Stoltenberg also pledged that NATO will supply Ukraine with weapons for its struggle against Russia's invasion for as long as necessary. USA TODAY on Telegram: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone. The alliance remains unconvinced that Russia is negotiating in good faith in the peace talks taking place in Istanbul. Russia must be judged on actions, not words, ""and it's obvious that we have seen little willingness from the Russian side to find a political solution,"" he said.  ""Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities,"" Stoltenberg said. ""So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering."" UKRAINE-RUSSIA CRISIS:Latest updates on the situation in Ukraine. Sign up here. LATEST MOVEMENT:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine Latest developments: ►President Joe Biden ordered the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to a spike in gas prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ►Syria is sending hundreds of fighters to join the Russian cause in Ukraine as a sort of favor repayment by President Bashar al-Assad for Moscow's help in his country's civil war, the New York Times reported. ►U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will travel to Moldova and Romania on Saturday to focus on efforts to assist refugees and the overwhelming humanitarian needs created by the war.  ►Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Thursday demanding payment for natural gas in rubles but appeared to temper the order by allowing dollar and euro payments through a designated bank, the latest twist over energy supplies that Europe relies on to heat homes and generate electricity. ►Talks between Ukraine and Russia will resume Friday by video, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arakhamia, said. Ukraine will not sign a peace treaty until Moscow withdraws its troops, he said.  The Ukrainian government said Russian forces blocked 45 buses that had been sent to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city of Mariupol, and only 631 people were able to get out of the city in private cars. Twelve Ukrainian trucks were able to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, but the supplies were seized by Russian troops, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said late Thursday. According to Ukrainian officials, tens of thousands of people have made it out of Mariupol in recent weeks along humanitarian corridors, reducing the prewar population of 430,000 to about 100,000 by last week. Vereshchuk said about 45,000 Mariupol residents have been forcefully deported to Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists. President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday there’s “no clear evidence” that Vladimir Putin is pulling all Russian forces out of Kyiv and that the Russian leader’s next military steps in Ukraine remain unclear. “There is also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area,” Biden said, referring to a contested region in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. “Depending on your view of Putin, I’m a little skeptical. It’s an open question whether he’s actually pulling back or going to say I’m just going to focus on the Donbas and I’m not worried about the rest of the country.” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that rather than pulling back their assault on the capital city and its surroundings as announced, Russian forces have intensified bombardment of homes, stores, libraries and other civilian sites on the city's outskirts. U.S. and British intelligence officials say Russian forces are repositioning and regrouping, not scaling back in and around Kyiv as the Kremlin said. ""It's not true,"" Klitschko said in a video address to European Union regional officials translated by Reuters. ""The whole night we listened to sirens, to rocket attacks, and we listened to huge explosions east of Kyiv and north of Kyiv. There are immense battles there, people died, still die."" The impact of a war that's not going according to plan appears to be taking an increasing toll on Russian forces and their leader. There are growing reports of friction between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his advisers, as well as discontent among the troops. ""He seems to be self-isolated, and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,'' President Joe Biden said of Putin. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence.'' The head of the U.K.'s spy service said it ""increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine and that Russian soldiers, short on weapons and morale, are refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their own equipment. ""And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,"" spy chief Jeremy Fleming said. A U.S. official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Putin has felt misled by the Russian military, leading to tension between the sides.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has stripped two generals of their military rank. Zelenskyy said “something prevented them from determining where their homeland was” and they “violated their military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people.” According to Zelenskyy, one of the generals had headed internal security at the SBU, the main intelligence agency. He said the other general had been the SBU head in the Kherson region, the first major city to fall to the Russians. Zelenskyy didn’t say anything about the fates of the two generals other than them being stripped of their rank. Russian troops were exposed to “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches around the Chernobyl nuclear plant and have left the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said Thursday. Energoatom said the Russians had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant, site in 1986 of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. The troops “panicked at the first sign of illness,” which “showed up very quickly,” and began to prepare to leave, said Energoatom, which did not provide information on the soldiers' condition. Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site early in the invasion that began Feb. 24, raising fears that they would cause damage or disruption that could spread radiation. On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Ukrainian officials informed it that the Russian forces who were in control of the plant have “in writing, transferred control” of the facility to Ukrainian personnel. At least one volunteer was killed and four other wounded when Russian forces shelled a humanitarian convoy of buses sent to evacuate residents from the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova said. She said the Russian troops besieging Chernihiv, about 90 miles north of Kyiv, have made it impossible to evacuate civilians from a city that has been cut off from food, water and other supplies. The global fishing industry expects to feel the impact of the sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine, with price increases and supply disruptions likely on the way. Russia is one of the biggest producers of seafood in the world and was the fifth-largest producer of wild-caught fish, according to a 2020 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In the U.S., which is not among the largest importers of seafood from Russia, the impact is most likely to be felt in products like fast-food sandwiches and fish sticks. British consumers will probably see a significant increase in the price of the popular fish and chips dish, because the UK and the European Union are deeply dependent on Russian seafood. The cost of seafood is already spiking in Japan, which is limiting its trade with Russia. “Because seafood is a global commodity, even if they are not harvested in Russia, you will notice the price hike,” said Kanae Tokunaga, who runs the Coastal and Marine Economics Lab at Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Germany’s economy minister says Europe should impose additional sanctions on Russia to encourage an end to what he described as a “barbaric” war in Ukraine. Robert Habeck said he discussed additional measures with French officials Thursday in Berlin. “The last package doesn’t need to be the final one, it should not be the final one,” he said. Habeck said French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had identified additional sanctions but did not detail them. Habeck declined to elaborate on what those points might be. Current sanctions include the freezing of assets held by the Russian central bank in the EU, the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT banking system and a ban on EU companies exporting high-tech products to Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Australia to increase sanctions against Russia and send him some armored vehicles in a video speech Thursday to the Australian Parliament. ""Most of all we have to keep those who are fighting against this evil armed,"" he said. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham did not directly respond to the request in a briefing, saying the government was considering what was practical. He said Australia has already provided missiles and protective gear to Ukraine. Zelenskyy said the war might not have happened if Russia had been punished after Russian-backed separatists shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Thirty-eight Australians were among the 298 aboard, all of whom perished. ""The unpunished evil comes back,"" Zelenskyy said. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Thursday ordering 134,500 new conscripts into the army as part of Russia's annual spring draft, but the defense ministry said the call-up was unrelated to the war. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the conscripts, ages 18-27, would be dispatched to bases in late May for 3-5 months of training. None will be sent to combat ""hot spots,"" he said. The defense ministry acknowledged earlier this month that some conscripts had been taking part in the war, despite Putin saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts. The International Committee of the Red Cross says its teams are ready to help evacuate civilians from of the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Our team in #Ukraine is on the road right now to be ready to: Facilitate the safe passage of civilians out of #Mariupol tomorrow. And bring aid,"" the Red Cross tweeted Thursday. ""All parties must agree to the exact terms. This operation is critical. Tens of thousands of lives depend on it.'' The evacuation could begin Friday provided all the parties agree to the terms, route, start time and the duration, the Red Cross said. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine is sending out several dozen buses to collect civilians from Mariupol after Russia's military agreed to a local cease-fire from the city to Ukraine-held Zaporizhzhia. Sensing the worst two weeks before Russia began invading his homeland, tech entrepreneur Volodymir ""Vlad"" Panchenko wanted to charter a plane for a month to get as many of his employees and their families out of Kyiv as quickly as possible. But the co-founder of video game and metaverse marketplace DMarket said his board was giving him heavy pushback because his plan to shuttle workers to the Balkan country of Montenegro would lead to a 20% budget increase. “None of them supported me. They said I was overreacting,” said Panchenko, who trusted his gut and told them he was executing his contingency plan anyway – regardless of the cost. “I told them that I felt a war was coming and we should leave. And if there isn’t, we’ll spend time in a warm place and still get our work done.” DMarket and many other tech companies rely on colleagues who live and work in Ukraine, a fast-growing tech hotbed. While known companies such as Google and  Microsoft have workers based in Ukraine, many far lesser-known, early- and mid-stage startups globally count on the embattled country’s talent-rich pool of engineers and developers and could be in jeopardy because of the conflict.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Friday, April 1, as Russia's invasion continues. Russian troops have continued to retreat from Kyiv in the last 24 hours, although the withdrawal remains at about 20% of the force Russian President Vladimir Putin sent to seize the Ukrainian capital, a senior Defense official said Thursday. The Pentagon believes the Russians are pulling back to get resupplied, not to wind down the war, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal intelligence assessments. As evidence, the official pointed to continued airstrikes and shelling of Kyiv by Russian troops. President Joe Biden supported that contention later in the day, saying there have been no clear signs the Russians are relenting in their assault around the capital. The official spoke to reporters hours after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg provided the same assessment in a briefing in Brussels. Stoltenberg also pledged that NATO will supply Ukraine with weapons for its struggle against Russia's invasion for as long as necessary. USA TODAY on Telegram: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone. The alliance remains unconvinced that Russia is negotiating in good faith in the peace talks taking place in Istanbul. Russia must be judged on actions, not words, ""and it's obvious that we have seen little willingness from the Russian side to find a political solution,"" he said.  ""Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities,"" Stoltenberg said. ""So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering."" UKRAINE-RUSSIA CRISIS:Latest updates on the situation in Ukraine. Sign up here. LATEST MOVEMENT:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine Latest developments: ►President Joe Biden ordered the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to a spike in gas prices triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ►Syria is sending hundreds of fighters to join the Russian cause in Ukraine as a sort of favor repayment by President Bashar al-Assad for Moscow's help in his country's civil war, the New York Times reported. ►U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will travel to Moldova and Romania on Saturday to focus on efforts to assist refugees and the overwhelming humanitarian needs created by the war.  ►Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Thursday demanding payment for natural gas in rubles but appeared to temper the order by allowing dollar and euro payments through a designated bank, the latest twist over energy supplies that Europe relies on to heat homes and generate electricity. ►Talks between Ukraine and Russia will resume Friday by video, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arakhamia, said. Ukraine will not sign a peace treaty until Moscow withdraws its troops, he said.  The Ukrainian government said Russian forces blocked 45 buses that had been sent to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city of Mariupol, and only 631 people were able to get out of the city in private cars. Twelve Ukrainian trucks were able to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, but the supplies were seized by Russian troops, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said late Thursday. According to Ukrainian officials, tens of thousands of people have made it out of Mariupol in recent weeks along humanitarian corridors, reducing the prewar population of 430,000 to about 100,000 by last week. Vereshchuk said about 45,000 Mariupol residents have been forcefully deported to Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists. President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday there’s “no clear evidence” that Vladimir Putin is pulling all Russian forces out of Kyiv and that the Russian leader’s next military steps in Ukraine remain unclear. “There is also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area,” Biden said, referring to a contested region in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. “Depending on your view of Putin, I’m a little skeptical. It’s an open question whether he’s actually pulling back or going to say I’m just going to focus on the Donbas and I’m not worried about the rest of the country.” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that rather than pulling back their assault on the capital city and its surroundings as announced, Russian forces have intensified bombardment of homes, stores, libraries and other civilian sites on the city's outskirts. U.S. and British intelligence officials say Russian forces are repositioning and regrouping, not scaling back in and around Kyiv as the Kremlin said. ""It's not true,"" Klitschko said in a video address to European Union regional officials translated by Reuters. ""The whole night we listened to sirens, to rocket attacks, and we listened to huge explosions east of Kyiv and north of Kyiv. There are immense battles there, people died, still die."" The impact of a war that's not going according to plan appears to be taking an increasing toll on Russian forces and their leader. There are growing reports of friction between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his advisers, as well as discontent among the troops. ""He seems to be self-isolated, and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,'' President Joe Biden said of Putin. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence.'' The head of the U.K.'s spy service said it ""increasingly looks like Putin has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine and that Russian soldiers, short on weapons and morale, are refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their own equipment. ""And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,"" spy chief Jeremy Fleming said. A U.S. official who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Putin has felt misled by the Russian military, leading to tension between the sides.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has stripped two generals of their military rank. Zelenskyy said “something prevented them from determining where their homeland was” and they “violated their military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people.” According to Zelenskyy, one of the generals had headed internal security at the SBU, the main intelligence agency. He said the other general had been the SBU head in the Kherson region, the first major city to fall to the Russians. Zelenskyy didn’t say anything about the fates of the two generals other than them being stripped of their rank.

This time the president announced plans to release up to 180 million barrels of oil —  up to 1 million a day —  from the reserve, the largest withdrawal in the reserve's history. Biden first dipped into the reserve in November, when he announced the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the stockpile in an attempt to bring down energy prices. That was before Russia, one of the world’s largest oil producers, invaded Ukraine in February, driving the west to impose tough sanctions on Russian oil and putting a further strain on the world’s oil supply.  After the war broke out, Biden committed to the release of an additional 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserve to combat soaring gas prices.   The moves have made little difference at the gas pump for consumers. The national gas average remains well above $4, according to the American Automobile Association.  WHAT MORE CAN BIDEN DO?:Gas prices are up. Way up. What can president to do combat rising prices at the pump? NOT THE FIRST TIME:US previously released 50M barrels from strategic oil reserve The strategic petroleum reserve is the country’s emergency stockpile of oil. It is managed by the Department of Energy and maintained for use during emergencies that create petroleum shortages like natural disasters and wars.  The reserves were established following the 1973 oil crisis,  when oil-producing Middle Eastern nations imposed an embargoon the United States f because of its support of Israel in the Arab-Israeli War.  President Gerald Ford created the reserve in 1975 with the signing of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which authorized a stockpile of up to 1 billion barrels of oil. Giant underground salt caverns at four sites lining the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coasts hold the nation’s reserves, according to the Department of Energy.  COST-SAVING TIPS:How to save money at the pump as gas prices hit all-time high with Russian invasion of Ukraine PRICE GOUGING:Are oil and gas companies price gouging consumers at the pump? RETIREMENT TIPS:4 signs you'd be better off selling your home before you retire They contained a high of 727 million barrels of oil in 2009. Before Biden authorized the release of 50 million barrels in November, the reserve had 605 million barrels of petroleum. As of March 25, the reserve held 568 million barrels of oil, according to the Department of Energy.  The 180 million barrel release would drop the reserve levels to 388 million barrels —  the lowest level since 1984, according to GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan.  Yes, Other nations keep emergency petroleum stockpiles too. And they have tapped into them in response to the energy crisis created by the war in Ukraine. In early March, 30 European nations drew from their stockpiles in conjunction with the United States. China maintains oil reserves as well.  Releasing 180 million barrels from the stockpile may provide modest and temporary relief at the gas pump for consumers, according to De Haan, but it isn’t a long-term solution to the energy crisis — especially if the war in Ukraine drags on indefinitely.  “I think most Americans are hoping for long term significant relief at the pump,” De Haan said. “This is not going to bring the relief millions of Americans are hoping for. And that’s because 180 million barrels is less than two days of global consumption.”  The United States consumes roughly 20 million barrels of oil a day.  The last two releases have had a marginal impact on gas prices, according to De Haan, who believes the most that a release of 180 million barrels from the reserve can drop gas prices by is 30 cents.  “And don’t run with the 30 cents, because that’s probably the least possible,” De Haan said. “Maybe somewhere in the 10 to 20 cent range, and it could be temporary.” "

That was before Russia, one of the world’s largest oil producers, invaded Ukraine in February, driving the west to impose tough sanctions on Russian oil and putting a further strain on the world’s oil supply.  After the war broke out, Biden committed to the release of an additional 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserve to combat soaring gas prices.   The moves have made little difference at the gas pump for consumers. The national gas average remains well above $4, according to the American Automobile Association.  WHAT MORE CAN BIDEN DO?:Gas prices are up. Way up. What can president to do combat rising prices at the pump? NOT THE FIRST TIME:US previously released 50M barrels from strategic oil reserve The strategic petroleum reserve is the country’s emergency stockpile of oil. It is managed by the Department of Energy and maintained for use during emergencies that create petroleum shortages like natural disasters and wars.  The reserves were established following the 1973 oil crisis,  when oil-producing Middle Eastern nations imposed an embargoon the United States f because of its support of Israel in the Arab-Israeli War.  President Gerald Ford created the reserve in 1975 with the signing of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which authorized a stockpile of up to 1 billion barrels of oil. Giant underground salt caverns at four sites lining the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coasts hold the nation’s reserves, according to the Department of Energy.  COST-SAVING TIPS:How to save money at the pump as gas prices hit all-time high with Russian invasion of Ukraine PRICE GOUGING:Are oil and gas companies price gouging consumers at the pump? RETIREMENT TIPS:4 signs you'd be better off selling your home before you retire They contained a high of 727 million barrels of oil in 2009. Before Biden authorized the release of 50 million barrels in November, the reserve had 605 million barrels of petroleum. As of March 25, the reserve held 568 million barrels of oil, according to the Department of Energy.  The 180 million barrel release would drop the reserve levels to 388 million barrels —  the lowest level since 1984, according to GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan.  Yes, Other nations keep emergency petroleum stockpiles too. And they have tapped into them in response to the energy crisis created by the war in Ukraine. In early March, 30 European nations drew from their stockpiles in conjunction with the United States. China maintains oil reserves as well.  Releasing 180 million barrels from the stockpile may provide modest and temporary relief at the gas pump for consumers, according to De Haan, but it isn’t a long-term solution to the energy crisis — especially if the war in Ukraine drags on indefinitely.  “I think most Americans are hoping for long term significant relief at the pump,” De Haan said. “This is not going to bring the relief millions of Americans are hoping for. And that’s because 180 million barrels is less than two days of global consumption.”  The United States consumes roughly 20 million barrels of oil a day.  The last two releases have had a marginal impact on gas prices, according to De Haan, who believes the most that a release of 180 million barrels from the reserve can drop gas prices by is 30 cents.  “And don’t run with the 30 cents, because that’s probably the least possible,” De Haan said. “Maybe somewhere in the 10 to 20 cent range, and it could be temporary.” "

Today, a look at the soaring death rates from fentanyl, plus Russian shelling picks back up after Russia said it would move its focus away from Central Ukraine, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Death rates are soaring across the US from fentanyl. The numbers are sparking a new debate around the war on drugs and what works, treatment or enforcement. National correspondent Romina Ruiz-Goiriena reports. Romina Ruiz-Goiriena: We've entered the deadliest wave of the opioid crisis yet. More than 100,000 people died from an overdose last year. That's the most ever recorded. Nearly two thirds are estimated to be fentanyl related. White House drugs czar, Dr. Rahul Gupta, told us he's worried. Dr. Rahul Gupta: This is a very historic time. We have never had the amount of death and destruction that we're seeing now from a drug overdose epidemic. The problem is that fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and one dose can kill you. It's also so much cheaper. In some parts of the country, people can buy a pill for a dollar. John Koch, a 33-year-old outreach worker with Community Medical Services in Phoenix, who is also in recovery from substance use disorder is seeing how much fentanyl is ravaging his community. John Koch: I have over 25 dead people on my phone right now. He's one of the many people we spoke to across the country. It's also alarming that overdose rates are growing fast in communities of color. And zip code is playing a role in whether people live or die. That's because treatment is expensive and a month in rehab can be the same as paying for a year of college tuition. Now over the years, nation reporter Rick Jervis and I have covered different aspects of the US war on drug. The soaring death toll is concerning to so many more foot soldiers in the fight to save people from substance use disorders. Rick and I set out to understand what experts, law enforcement, advocates, doctors, and those who have experienced substance use disorder themselves consider to be the best way to end the country's long drug use crisis. There's basically two camps and they boil down to these two questions: continue to invest and have century-old policies that prioritize enforcement and place people in jail, or increase the focus on harm reduction programs that emphasize clean needles and education to users. Enforcement hawks claim government dollars shouldn't be spent allowing people to use drugs. One of the biggest issues is that fentanyl is coming in at record rates through the Southern US border. Alberto Flores, Custom and Border Protection Port Director for the Laredo Port of Entry said, it's extremely difficult to detect fentanyl. Alberto Flores: Again, we know the transnational criminal organizations, they pay the numbers, right? You got 7,000 trucks. So obviously they know that it's impossible to inspect every truck. So again, we heavily rely obviously in our targeting team and, of course, our enforcement teams out there that are trying to find those needles in a haystack, right? Because again, it's challenging. But some, including White House health experts argue that it's impossible for America to seize its way out of this spiraling fentanyl crisis. They say harm reduction programs are the nation's antidote to the disease. Under President Biden's proposed budget released this week, the federal government wants to spend 42.5 billion, that's a historic amount, on recovery services and harm reduction. And for the first time ever 10% of the 3.5 billion earmarked for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration would be set aside for recovery services, basically helping people who have historically been unable to access care. And while all of these policies continue to be ironed out, Americans are dying at record numbers. But the answer we kept hearing over and over, there's no silver bullet to end the drug use crisis and still, people need help getting life saving treatment.

Ukrainian officials say Russian shelling has picked back up around the capital of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv. That comes after explicit comments from Russia, that it was shifting focus away from that region to the country's eastern Donbas region. Chernihiv City Council Secretary Olexander Lomako said the Russian announcement turned out to be a lie. And the continued shelling will likely cast a cloud on peace talks that are ongoing in Turkey. Still, Russia's military has struggled on the ground in Ukraine and several units suffering heavy losses have returned home or to Belarus to resupply, that's according to the British Defense Ministry. A British intelligence official also said this week that some demoralized Russian soldiers in Ukraine have refused to carry out orders. And at one point even accidentally shot down their own aircraft. Western intelligence officials increasingly feel that Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisors are misinforming him about the military's performance in Ukraine. White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. Kate Bedingfield: We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership. We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisors about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisors are too afraid to tell him the truth. As for peace talks in Istanbul, there appeared to be progress on Tuesday when the outlines of a possible agreement seemed to emerge. Ukraine offered to declare itself neutral and drop its bid to join NATO, as Russia has demanded, that would be in return for security guarantees from other countries. Top Russia officials responded to that positively and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, the move marked significant progress. But those statements were followed by more Russian shelling. Ukrainian military officials said Russian shells targeted residential areas and civilian infrastructure around the capital. And the Russian Defense Ministry said it targeted fuel depots in Central Ukraine, along with a Ukrainian special forces headquarters in the southern Mykolaiv region and two ammunition depots in the Donetsk region. Five weeks into the invasion, that's left thousands dead, more than four million Ukrainians have fled the country, half of them children, according to the United Nations. Electric cars are increasingly going mainstream. Americans are turning to EVs because they're cheap to run, not much more expensive than gasoline-fueled cars and for some, fun to drive. And National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise says all kinds of people, regardless of political association, are buying them. Elizabeth Weise: So it was fascinating. I'd been thinking about a story about electric cars for a while. And then gas prices started to take off and people started talking about them. Though, of course, as soon as that happened, it became very hard to buy an electric car because everybody else was buying them. But the thing that really surprised me when I talked to people who are... And these are not Tesla people. Tesla is the most popular electric car in the United States, but I mean, Teslas are expensive and I kind of didn't want to get into the whole, well, that's just a luxury car. So I was talking to people who had Leafs and Bolts and Kias and Hyundais. I mean, these are electric cars that are in the same price range if you just went out and bought a gas car. And one of the things that really surprised me was the number of people I spoke with who said, ""I am a Republican, I am conservative as all get out. I voted for Trump and I'd vote for Trump again, but why wouldn't I want to drive an electric car? They're fun to drive. They're cheap when you look over the lifetime of the car. And I don't have to buy gas. I mean, this is a win-win."" And I was looking at this tick and this again, was a surprise. We have a fair number of electric cars on the market in the United States now, and there's a bunch coming. There's 30 models that are coming out in the next two years because automakers are really shifting to these, not in part for the American market, but mostly for the international market because the rest of the world is shifting to EVs. And China is the largest car market in the world at this point. So if I'm Ford or Chevrolet, I'm thinking, okay, where is my market? What cars am I making for that market? We're part of it, but we're not the whole market. You can find Elizabeth's full story in today's episode description. President Joe Biden is set to order the release of up to a million barrels of oil a day from the country's strategic petroleum reserve. The move comes as a way to try and control energy prices that have spiked after the US and allies imposed steep sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The announcement could come as soon as today when the White House says Biden is planning to give remarks on his administration's plans to fight rising gas prices. The duration of the oil release has not been finalized, but could last for several months, according to anonymous sources to the AP. The resignation of Republican Nebraska US Congressman Jeff Fortenberry will take effect today. The lawmaker was convicted by a California jury of lying to federal authorities about an illegal campaign donation from a foreign national. He was indicted in October after authorities said he lied to FBI agents in two interviews about his knowledge of an illegal $30,000 contribution from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent.

2022-03-31 15:08:05+00:00,Biden to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from strategic reserves to drive down gas prices,"USA TODAY, Michael Collins, USA TODAY",USA Today,usa-today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/31/gas-prices-biden-release-oil-strategic-reserves/7229635001/,President Joe Biden's actions will represent the largest release from the strategic reserve in its nearly 50-year history.,WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden will order the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day for the next six months from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to a spike in gas prices … [+1034 chars],"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden has ordered the release of up to 180 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency reserves over the next six months in a bid to provide relief to Americans from gas prices that have soared since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Biden's order, announced Thursday, calls for the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day over the next six months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The action will represent the largest release from the reserve in its nearly 50-year history. ""This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world and pain at the pump for American families,"" Biden said. Gas prices at the pump have jumped by nearly $1 per gallon in the month since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and now average $4.20 per gallon, with even higher prices in some areas. The war means less Russian oil is getting to the market, and the reduction in supply is raising prices at the pump. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE EXPLAINED:What is it and can it lower gas? KEEPING A LID ON GAS: Prices are up. What can Biden do to lower costs at the pump amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine? Biden predicted that releasing oil from the strategic reserves would cause gas prices to drop, ""but how far down, I don't think anyone can tell,"" he said. The administration predicts that release of the oil will serve as a bridge until the end of the year, when domestic production ramps up. The Energy Department will use revenue from the release to restock the emergency stockpile in future years, the officials said. Biden is acting in coordination with other countries, which also are expected to release oil from their emergency stockpiles. RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS BANNED:Biden announces ban on all Russian energy imports over Ukraine invasion; experts expect gas price spike Biden's decision to release oil from the strategic reserves is the third time in four months that he has tapped into the emergency stockpile. In November, Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency stockpile to lower energy costs amid a spike in gas prices and soaring inflation. Earlier this month, he released another 30 million barrels from the stockpile. 'FEELING THE IMPACT':US to release 50M barrels from strategic oil reserve amid soaring gas prices Meanwhile, to encourage U.S. companies to ramp up domestic production, Biden also is proposing a ""use it or lose it"" policy for companies to produce more oil with the resources they already have. Right now, the oil and gas industry is sitting on more than 9,000 approved but unused permits for production on federal lands. Biden called for Congress to force companies to pay fees on wells from leases that they haven't used in years. Companies that are producing from leased acres and existing wells won't be subject to the fees. But companies that continue to sit on nonproducing acres will have to choose whether to start producing or pay a fee. While some companies already have announced that they are increasing production, others are raking in record profits while American struggle to make ends meet, Biden said. ""This is not the time to sit on record profits,"" Biden said. ""It's time to step up for the good of your country."" In addition, Biden plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost the U.S. production of minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles amid high gas prices and supply-chain challenges. Biden will add minerals such as lithium, nickel, graphite, cobalt and manganese to the list of items covered by the Cold War-era national-security mobilization law passed in 1950. Such materials are also used for other types of stationary batteries, which would also be targeted under the action.  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a stockpile to preserve access to oil in case of natural disasters, national security issues and other events. Maintained by the Energy Department, the reserves are stored in caverns created in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts. Before Biden's orders, there were roughly 605 million barrels of petroleum in the reserve. The reserve was established by Congress in 1975 after the oil crisis in 1973 when oil-exporting nations throttled their production and caused energy prices to soar. The United States has tapped the reserve to raise revenue as shifts in global oil production made lawmakers less concerned about potential shortages. Before Biden, the last major release of the oil reserve came in 2011, when President Barack Obama released 30 million barrels of oil to counter disruptions in supply due to civil unrest in Libya. President George W. Bush released 11 million barrels of oil from the reserve in 2005 to counter disruptions from Hurricane Katrina, and his father, President George H.W. Bush, released 17 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War.

RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS BANNED:Biden announces ban on all Russian energy imports over Ukraine invasion; experts expect gas price spike Biden's decision to release oil from the strategic reserves is the third time in four months that he has tapped into the emergency stockpile. In November, Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the nation's emergency stockpile to lower energy costs amid a spike in gas prices and soaring inflation. Earlier this month, he released another 30 million barrels from the stockpile. 'FEELING THE IMPACT':US to release 50M barrels from strategic oil reserve amid soaring gas prices Meanwhile, to encourage U.S. companies to ramp up domestic production, Biden also is proposing a ""use it or lose it"" policy for companies to produce more oil with the resources they already have. Right now, the oil and gas industry is sitting on more than 9,000 approved but unused permits for production on federal lands. Biden called for Congress to force companies to pay fees on wells from leases that they haven't used in years. Companies that are producing from leased acres and existing wells won't be subject to the fees. But companies that continue to sit on nonproducing acres will have to choose whether to start producing or pay a fee. While some companies already have announced that they are increasing production, others are raking in record profits while American struggle to make ends meet, Biden said. ""This is not the time to sit on record profits,"" Biden said. ""It's time to step up for the good of your country."" In addition, Biden plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost the U.S. production of minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles amid high gas prices and supply-chain challenges. Biden will add minerals such as lithium, nickel, graphite, cobalt and manganese to the list of items covered by the Cold War-era national-security mobilization law passed in 1950. Such materials are also used for other types of stationary batteries, which would also be targeted under the action.  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a stockpile to preserve access to oil in case of natural disasters, national security issues and other events. Maintained by the Energy Department, the reserves are stored in caverns created in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts. Before Biden's orders, there were roughly 605 million barrels of petroleum in the reserve. The reserve was established by Congress in 1975 after the oil crisis in 1973 when oil-exporting nations throttled their production and caused energy prices to soar. The United States has tapped the reserve to raise revenue as shifts in global oil production made lawmakers less concerned about potential shortages. Before Biden, the last major release of the oil reserve came in 2011, when President Barack Obama released 30 million barrels of oil to counter disruptions in supply due to civil unrest in Libya. President George W. Bush released 11 million barrels of oil from the reserve in 2005 to counter disruptions from Hurricane Katrina, and his father, President George H.W. Bush, released 17 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War.

Donald Trump has asked another foreign leader for information on President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden — an action that led to the former president's first impeachment by the House in 2020. In the midst of Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine, Trump took the opportunity to ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to release any information he has on rumors that a Russian oligarch invested a decade ago in a company founded by Hunter Biden. ""I would think Putin would know the answer to that,"" Trump said an interview on the ""Just The News"" television program. ""I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer."" There is no evidence Hunter Biden engaged in illicit dealings with Russia.  Trump, who has come under fire for praising the authoritarian Putin, previously pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens and hinted that U.S. military assistance to his country hinged on his answer.  Trump also implored Putin during his 2016 presidential campaign to find and release former Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails. It's Amy and Chelsey with today's top stories. Biden announced Thursday that he would order the release of up to 180 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next six months. The new supply is expected to help provide relief to Americans paying high gas prices amid Russia's war against Ukraine. The release of 1 million barrels of oil a day will mark the largest release from the reserve in its nearly 50-year history. Less Russian oil has been making its way to the international market since the war began in late February. The reduction in supply has raised the price of gasoline in the U.S. by nearly $1 per gallon. The Biden administration expects domestic oil production to ramp up by the end of the year. Senior administration officials say the Energy Department will use revenue from the release to restock the emergency stockpile in future years.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to issue the order later this week to end the Title 42 policy, according to the Wall Street Journal. It could take effect in late May. The Associated Press reported the decision is not yet final. The decision to end the policy would allow the Department of Homeland Security to prepare for an increase of migrants who may come to the border, the outlets reported. The White House declined to confirm whether Title 42 will be ended. “This is a decision that we have long deferred to CDC,” White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday. “Title 42 is a public health directive.

Exercise plays only a tiny percentage of our daily calorie burn. Hormones are the true culprits behind weight gain."" The post claims ""most women constantly fight against their Hormones,"" causing their ""metabolism come to a standstill.” The video has been viewed more than 600,000 times in two months. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks But the post’s core claim – that hormones are the “true culprits” behind weight gain – isn’t true. Multiple factors can contribute to weight gain, and while there is an ongoing debate about the role that hormones play, experts agree lifestyle is the key factor.  USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the claim for comment. Calling hormones the “true culprit” behind women’s weight gain isn’t correct, according to Susan Davis, a professor of Chronic Disease & Aging at Monash University in Australia.   If they were, Davis said, “everyone would be fat.” Instead, she said diet is the primary culprit. According to the National Institutes of Health, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they burn, and this imbalance is “the greatest contributor to weight gain.” Davis added that diet is a crucial part of weight loss, as exercise alone doesn’t always burn calories at the rate some might expect. “Twenty minutes of exercise is a glass of orange juice and three hours of exercise is a Big Mac,” Davis said. “And most people who eat a Big Mac don't go out and do three hours of sustained exercise to follow that.”  That isn’t to say exercise is ineffective. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, physical activity is “one of the most important things” a person can do to improve their health. Regular physical activity is also associated with reduced weight gain and weight loss – especially “when combined with reduced calorie intake."" Fact check roundup:What's true and what's false about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Davis recommends those who try to lose weight do so slowly. For example, she said someone can think of one thing they eat on most days, and then cut that out of their diet. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, hormones can control everything from metabolism and energy levels to growth and development. Hormones play a role in weight, experts told USA TODAY – but they are not the primary driver of weight gain, as the post claims. Dr. Artur Viana, clinical director of the Metabolic Health & Weight Loss Program at Yale University, said that while hormones are involved in obesity, they are not the sole cause. Robert Lustig, professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of California-San Francisco, told USA TODAY there’s an ongoing debate in the nutrition field over the extent to which hormones contribute to obesity. “Is obesity a problem of energy balance, or is obesity a problem of energy storage?” he said. “If it’s a problem of energy balance, it’s all about calories. If it’s about energy storage, then the question is: What’s storing it? And the answer is one of two hormones: insulin and cortisol.”  For example, when blood sugar rises, the hormone insulin goes up, allowing sugar to exit the blood and enter cells where it is needed. But when cells receive more sugar than they need, fat begins to accumulate. However, insulin itself doesn't cause weight gain. Lustig's recommendation for people looking to lose weight is simple: Stop eating sugar.  “That’s numbers one, two and three,” he said. “Get rid of the sugar, get rid of the sugar, get rid of the sugar.” Since hormones regularly fluctuate in women – and since those fluctuations can cause a variety of symptoms – Davis said that hormones are often implicated when other health problems arise, sometimes without justification. Some hormone-related disorders can cause weight changes. Hyperthyroidism, for example, occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine, according to the Mayo Clinic. That can result in weight loss or gain. But that doesn't establish hormones as a driving factor for all weight gain. Fact check:False claim that Chris Rock apologized to Will Smith after Oscars slap Pregnant women also gain weight in part due to the release of hormones that encourage fat deposits, Davis said. But she said pregnancy is not a woman’s general state, and therefore the “rich hormonal milieu” of pregnancy can’t be implicated in all weight gain, either.  Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that hormones are the “true culprits” behind weight gain in women. While certain conditions involving hormones can affect a woman’s weight, those conditions aren't responsible for weight gain in all women. And though there is an ongoing debate over the role hormones play in obesity, experts agree that lifestyle, especially diet, is the main factor affecting weight.  Thank you for supporting our journalism.

The freshman at Dartmouth College is often thinking about her family who fled the Russian military, her dad who remains in their hometown, and when she'll be able to return home.  She's afraid to go to sleep and miss news about her family. ""You kind of enter like this alternative world where you're not in America and you're not in Ukraine, you're like somewhere in between,"" she said, describing her experience as ""second-hand PTSD."" ""And this just affects your mental health a lot."" Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hulievska, 19, has continued studying medieval history and creative writing while fundraising and organizing rallies with the newly formed Ukrainian Student Association at Dartmouth in New Hampshire. It has helped distract herself from constantly checking the news.  Meanwhile, her mother, sisters and grandmother were forced to flee to western Ukraine from Zaporizhzhia when Russian military forces took over Europe's largest nuclear plant. She worries about her father, who stayed behind and has to keep the lights off after dark to protect himself from Russian troops targeting civilian areas. She said he is often awoken by the sound of sirens summoning him to bomb shelters – sometimes up to three times a night.  ""There's a lot of guilt involved too, you know. Why am I here in the safe place where they are not?"" she said. ""Sometimes, it's like one step away from despair."" Hulievska is one of hundreds of Ukrainian students living in the United States and anxiously awaiting news about friends and family who remain there amid the invasion. Many are balancing studying abroad with organizing on campus to raise awareness about the war. Unsure if they'll be able to return to Ukraine when their programs end, many are trying to find ways to stay in the country longer. ""It is really hard to be going through a crisis in your country when you're not in your country,"" said Sarah Ilchman, co-president of the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit that helps students and scholars connect with international experiences. ""Maybe there are people at home who were going to pay for their tuition and that's not there anymore.""  'THIS IS MY LAND, I STAY': These Ukrainian women are among thousands choosing to fight, not flee There are more than 1,700 students from Ukraine studying at colleges and universities in the U.S., according to a 2021 report from the institute.  The IIE has launched grants and scholarships – and is taking donations – to provide resources for Ukrainian students, threatened and displaced scholars, and student refugees, Ilchman said. On campuses, international student service offices are also facilitating emergency funding, helping connect Ukrainian students and offer mental health resources.  ""That's so critically important to support students holistically,"" Ilchman said. ""When they're in crisis, you need to take care of all the needs not just the the visa status or the academic or the financial, but obviously clearly also the emotional."" Institutions are also helping students secure temporary protected status, which the Department of Homeland Security early this month extended to Ukrainians who have lived in the United States since March. The status will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months. RETURNING HOME:International students finally escape Ukraine: 'It felt like a miracle' Anastasiia Pereverten, 19, plans to apply for temporary protected status after she finishes the spring semester at the University of Wyoming where she is studying cultural studies. She wants to get a work permit to find an internship, since she'll no longer have access to university housing or dining when the semester ends in May. ""I have no physical ability to get back home,"" said Pereverten, a sophomore student from Kyiv. ""For now, it's the only plan I have because that's basically the only choice you have.""  She has been afraid for her family, who are now in the suburbs of Kyiv in a ""relatively safe place."" She has adjusted to her new reality by focusing on supporting them and her country, she said.  As the only Ukrainian student on campus, she's organized a number of rallies and talks at her school. She's also raised more than $1,000 to send to the Ukrainian army for ammunition and supplies. ""I'm trying to do my best in terms of supporting my country and my people and my family,"" she said. ""Their emotional state is now like high priority for me."" WHERE ARE THEY GOING? Millions of refugees are fleeing Ukraine Like Pereverten, 16-year-old Yaryna Kholod is the only Ukrainian student living on campus at the Emma Willard School in New York. She arrived in September for a year abroad. Kholod said the past few weeks have been difficult because her grandparents live in Mykolaiv, where shelling has recently damaged a cancer hospital and residential buildings.  Meanwhile, her 10-year-old sister, frightened by what sounded like an explosion at a nearby airport not long after the invasion, packed the family's photo albums and fled with their mother to western Ukraine. Their father stayed behind and joined the territorial defense. She said her school has been incredibly supportive. Kholod gave a speech offering advice for students and faculty on how they can support Ukraine and afterward her classmates created a large poster with messages of support.  ""That was very sweet,"" she said. ""And I have been very positively surprised that after that a lot of community members have been reaching out to me."" For Hanna Onyshchenko, a Ph.D. student studying economics at the University of Michigan, spending time with the other Ukrainian and Ukrainian American students helps her feel less alone. She has been glued to the news, but her friends make sure she is taking breaks, going for walks and getting out in the sun, she said.  ""It helps emotionally because you don't need to say many words,"" she said. ""We help our friends to get their families out of country just because we know each other."" Onyshchenko spends half her days organizing to raise awareness about Ukraine and gathering aid for students who are struggling financially. The 28-year-old from Chernihiv, which has been attacked by Russian forces, is leading a petition asking her university to ""publicly condemn the invasion and prioritize aid to Ukrainian scholars and students fleeing the conflict.""  University of Michigan's president has since denounced the attacks and the school became one of several to announce it will start the process to end its current investments in Russia. Onyshchenko said when she first arrived in the U.S. in 2018, no one understood her concern that Russia might invade Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the Donbas region. Now that her fears have been validated, she's frustrated at the lack of action from the international community and hopes the war won't fade out of Western news cycles. ""My president asks for help, and the people in Europe still hesitate,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""You're like, 'here we go again, the same cycles.'"" She urged Americans to listen to the experiences of Ukrainians, warning of the dangerous effects of propaganda. Onyshchenko said her grandmother, who moved to Russian in 2016, no longer speaks to her after watching Russian media. Russian President Vladimir Putin has criminalized the spread of information that counters the government’s narrative about the war, which the country refers to as a “special military operation."" ""I just want people to pay attention to history and to the experience that Ukrainians have in this war,"" she said. ""I believe in our army, I believe in people and believe that if there will be a call, I'll also go back home and fight for Ukraine. We deserve to have our homes.""

She has adjusted to her new reality by focusing on supporting them and her country, she said.  As the only Ukrainian student on campus, she's organized a number of rallies and talks at her school. She's also raised more than $1,000 to send to the Ukrainian army for ammunition and supplies. ""I'm trying to do my best in terms of supporting my country and my people and my family,"" she said. ""Their emotional state is now like high priority for me."" WHERE ARE THEY GOING? Millions of refugees are fleeing Ukraine Like Pereverten, 16-year-old Yaryna Kholod is the only Ukrainian student living on campus at the Emma Willard School in New York. She arrived in September for a year abroad. Kholod said the past few weeks have been difficult because her grandparents live in Mykolaiv, where shelling has recently damaged a cancer hospital and residential buildings.  Meanwhile, her 10-year-old sister, frightened by what sounded like an explosion at a nearby airport not long after the invasion, packed the family's photo albums and fled with their mother to western Ukraine. Their father stayed behind and joined the territorial defense. She said her school has been incredibly supportive. Kholod gave a speech offering advice for students and faculty on how they can support Ukraine and afterward her classmates created a large poster with messages of support.  ""That was very sweet,"" she said. ""And I have been very positively surprised that after that a lot of community members have been reaching out to me."" For Hanna Onyshchenko, a Ph.D. student studying economics at the University of Michigan, spending time with the other Ukrainian and Ukrainian American students helps her feel less alone. She has been glued to the news, but her friends make sure she is taking breaks, going for walks and getting out in the sun, she said.  ""It helps emotionally because you don't need to say many words,"" she said. ""We help our friends to get their families out of country just because we know each other."" Onyshchenko spends half her days organizing to raise awareness about Ukraine and gathering aid for students who are struggling financially. The 28-year-old from Chernihiv, which has been attacked by Russian forces, is leading a petition asking her university to ""publicly condemn the invasion and prioritize aid to Ukrainian scholars and students fleeing the conflict.""  University of Michigan's president has since denounced the attacks and the school became one of several to announce it will start the process to end its current investments in Russia. Onyshchenko said when she first arrived in the U.S. in 2018, no one understood her concern that Russia might invade Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the Donbas region. Now that her fears have been validated, she's frustrated at the lack of action from the international community and hopes the war won't fade out of Western news cycles. ""My president asks for help, and the people in Europe still hesitate,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""You're like, 'here we go again, the same cycles.'"" She urged Americans to listen to the experiences of Ukrainians, warning of the dangerous effects of propaganda. Onyshchenko said her grandmother, who moved to Russian in 2016, no longer speaks to her after watching Russian media. Russian President Vladimir Putin has criminalized the spread of information that counters the government’s narrative about the war, which the country refers to as a “special military operation."" ""I just want people to pay attention to history and to the experience that Ukrainians have in this war,"" she said. ""I believe in our army, I believe in people and believe that if there will be a call, I'll also go back home and fight for Ukraine. We deserve to have our homes.""

In the draw held Friday, the Americans were drawn into Group B. They won’t know … [+2080 chars]","Getting out of the group is only one of the goals the U.S. men have for the World Cup in Qatar. A World Cup game against England, a team with as rich a history as any in the game and a team most fans know as well as their own, is an opportunity for the Americans to show the progress they’ve made. Play well against England, and it can open eyes and opportunities for this group of players and the ones who will come after them. “That’s the goal Gregg (Berhalter) set out to accomplish when he took over” as coach, midfielder Weston McKennie said after Friday’s draw. “That’s something that’s always reiterated when we go into camp, to change the way the world views American soccer. No better place and no better time to be able to do that. “We definitely have the desire to go out there and show we’re not afraid. We don’t belittle ourselves just because we’re playing against England.” Drawn into Group B on Friday, the Americans also will play Iran and either Scotland, Ukraine or Wales in the World Cup later this year. They won’t know their first opponent until after the playoff in June, but their first game will be Nov. 21, which is also the first day of the World Cup. The U.S. then plays England on Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. The USMNT concludes group play against Iran on Nov. 29. WAY-TOO-EARLY PREDICTIONS:Breaking down the draw for Qatar 2022 While all three group games are important, it’s no surprise the England game immediately drew the most attention. England is currently No. 5 in the world. It was the runner-up at the last European championship, in 2020. Two years earlier, it reached the semifinals at the World Cup in Russia. England’s Premier League, and those who play in it, are also what even casual American soccer fans know best. Premier League games are as accessible in the United States as NFL games, making players such as Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish as familiar as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Gio Reyna. For a U.S. squad that is loaded with talent but still inexperienced on the world stage, England will provide a good measuring stick. “We want to change how everyone looks at us as players and as a nation and ultimately gain the respect of fans around the world,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “We’re not just there to show up. We want to have an impact, obviously on ourselves and our team, but ultimately on how (U.S.) soccer is viewed. “You want to gain the respect of some of the best footballing nations in the world.” That isn’t a cliché, by the way. Despite much of the U.S. team playing in Europe, including several at some of the biggest clubs, American soccer is still considered by many around the world as a development project. The headline in the Daily Mail after the draw said England had gotten a “dream World Cup draw,” and looked ahead to a possible matchup with France. In the quarterfinals. This even though the USMNT won the group in 2010, the last time it faced England in the World Cup. The only other World Cup game between the teams was in 1950, when the Americans won 1-0, an upset so shocking some newspapers assumed the scoreline was wrong. “I know there is a lot of respect for American soccer, but this is an opportunity for us to show what we’re made of,” Berhalter said. “They have a good team, but so do we.” Because the World Cup is being played in November and December, in the middle of the European soccer season, players are only being released from the clubs a week before the tournament. That means teams in the first groups, including the USMNT, will have little time together before their first match. If someone is injured or even worn down, there won’t be any time to get healthy or regroup. It also could affect team chemistry, though the U.S. players have talked often – and positively – about the tight bonds they’ve developed over the past few years. The short time to prepare for the first game puts even more importance on the international windows in June and September, and Berhalter said he’s already told his players they’ll need to be available for both of those camps. “We’ll never have enough time on the field, which is shame. But that is what it is,” Berhalter said. “We’re going to have to be really effective in these weeks in June and then when we get together in September. Because when we get to Qatar, it’s basically prep for a game and go from there.” The one advantage to playing on the first day is that, should the USMNT get out of the group, they would have three or four days of rest before the knockout rounds. The round of 16 begins Dec. 3 with the quarterfinals starting Dec. 9. The semifinals are Dec. 13 and 14. The final is Dec. 18.   The USMNT has only faced Iran twice, including a 2-1 loss at the 1998 World Cup that had significant political overtones. Relations between the two countries have been strained, at best, because of U.S. support for the last shah and its backing of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War, as well as Iran’s takeover of the U.S. Embassy during the revolution and the 14-month hostage crisis that followed. The handshakes before the game in France had to be choreographed, and Iran’s players gave U.S. players white roses as a symbol of peace. The victory was Iran’s first ever at the World Cup. “I’m not sure the tension is what it (was). If we were friends back in ’98, 24 years later, I don’t see it any differently,” Berhalter said. “I don’t see them as rivals, I see them as colleagues and two teams competing for the World Cup and trying to do well for their countries in the World Cup.” No matter if it is Scotland, Wales or Ukraine that advances out of the European playoff, it will be the USMNT’s first World Cup game against them. The U.S. men are 2-3-3 all-time against Scotland, their last game a 0-0 tie in 2013. They have played Wales only twice, winning once and playing to a 0-0 tie in 2020. They have not beaten Ukraine in their previous four games, losing three and tying once. “Overall, it’s going to be a strong group,” Berhalter said. “It’s going to be a well-rounded group, and it’s going to be difficult to advance.” Here's the full draw: Group A Group B Group C Group D Group E Group F Group G Group H"

Moscow took control of Chernobyl over a month ago. According to Ukrainian officials, Russian troops destroyed a new laboratory at the plant working to improve management of radioactive waste that had ""highly active samples and samples of radionuclides"" last week. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka, which are south of the besieged northern city of Chernihiv and located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, according to Britain's Defense Ministry. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set to resume talks via video Friday, five weeks into a conflict that has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine.

Check out the 5 Things podcast:  Defying a pandemic and supply chain disruptions, the U.S. economy has cranked out more than 400,000 jobs every month for nearly a year — a significant winning streak in uncertain times. And despite surging inflation, the hiring wave continued last month in the face of yet another jolt: Russia's war in Ukraine, which has unsettled the economic outlook and catapulted gasoline prices to painful levels. U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said Friday, as tumbling COVID-19 cases more than offset growing concerns about soaring inflation and the war in Ukraine. That marks a drop from the 678,000 jobs added in February. However, the unemployment rate fell from 3.8% to 3.6%, marking the lowest rate since just before the pandemic struck two years ago, when joblessness reached a 50-year low of 3.5%. The nation has now recovered 93% of the 22 million jobs lost early in the pandemic, leaving it 1.6 million jobs short of its pre-crisis level, a gap that could be closed by summer.  Vaccinated tourists going to Canada will no longer need to get a pre-departure COVID test starting Friday. The change, announced March 14, is the latest easing of travel restrictions by Canada, which originally closed its borders to nonessential travel after the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. People who have received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or a single dose of Johnson and Johnson's vaccine at least 14 days before arriving in Canada are considered fully vaccinated; boosters are not necessary. Travelers who are not fully vaccinated are only allowed entry under certain circumstances and will need to test for coronavirus before and after arrival and quarantine for 14 days.

If confirmed, it would mark the first Ukrainian airstrike on Russian soil. ""Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, said the Russian claims do not ""correspond with reality."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to comment on whether he ordered the alleged attack during an interview on Fox News. Zelenskyy said he does not discuss any orders he issues as commander in chief.   Russia continued withdrawing some of its troops from around Ukraine's capital Friday, though Ukrainian and Western officials have said Russian forces may be resupplying and shifting focus elsewhere. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that its attempt to evacuate residents in the besieged port city Mariupol failed but they would try again Saturday. ""Today, our team tried to facilitate a safe passage out of Mariupol,” the ICRC said in a Twitter statement Friday. ""But had to return to Zaporizhzhia after conditions made it impossible to proceed. We will try again tomorrow.”  The city remained closed for entry and was “very dangerous” for people trying to leave, said Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol. He added that Russian forces had been blocking humanitarian supplies since Thursday, according to Reuters. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have made it out of Mariupol through humanitarian corridors, reducing the city's population from 430,000 to 100,000 by last week.

The number of Russians released was not disclosed. ►Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 153 children have been killed and 245 injured, according to a Telegram post from Ukraine attorney general's office on Friday. The most children have been injured in the Kyiv region. ► It will cost at least $10 billion to renew the Mariupol's' infrastructure due to damage caused by the war, the city council said in a Telegram post Friday.  Mayor Vadim Boychenko said he would push for reparations from Russia to compensate for Mariupol and its citizens' “suffering and damage.” ►Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Thursday demanding payment for natural gas in rubles but appeared to temper the order by allowing dollar and euro payments through a designated bank The U.S. Department of Defense announced Friday evening it will provide an additional $300 million in military equipment to Ukraine.  ""This decision underscores the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia's war of choice,"" said John Kirby, Defense Department press secretary. Kirby said the equipment will include laser-guided rocket systems, unmanned aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition, night vision gear and medical supplies. The equipment adds to the $1.6 billion in U.S. aid money to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, he said. An attempt by humanitarian groups to remove civilians from the besieged port city of Mariupol failed Friday.  A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was planning to enter Mariupol to deliver emergency humanitarian aid and begin evacuating residents but had to return to Zaporizhzhia. The Mariupol city council said Friday that buses escorted by the Red Cross and State Emergency Service of Ukraine would take more than 2,000 citizens. The Russian military said it committed to a ceasefire between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia. But Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol, said Friday the city remained closed for entry and was “very dangerous” for people trying to leave, according to Reuters.

The unemployment rate fell from 3.8% to 3.6%, the Labor Department said Friday. That puts it just above the 50-year low of 3.5% just before the pandemic upended the economy in March 2020. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 440,000 jobs were added last month. The economy has now added more than 400,000 jobs a month for 11 months, the longest such streak on record, Morgan Stanley noted in a report. President Joe Biden touted the drop in unemployment – down from 6.4% when he entered office – as the “fastest decline in unemployment to start a president’s term ever recorded.” Of course, COVID-19 created a massive gap in the labor market, creating significant room for recovery. The nation has recouped 20.4 million, or 93%, of the 22 million jobs lost early in the health crisis, leaving it 1.6 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level, a gap that could be closed by summer.

The drop in unemployment came even as the number of people working or looking for jobs grew by 418,000, pushing the labor force participation rate from 62.3% to 62.4%, the highest since March 2020. More people who had been fearful of COVID-19 or staying home caring for children, among others, are returning to a favorable labor market with rising wages. The number of people who couldn't look for work because of the pandemic fell to 874,000 from 1.2 million in February, Labor said, Last month, leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, the sector hit hardest by the pandemic, led the job gains with 112,000; professional and business services added 102,000; retail, 49,000; manufacturing, 38,000; and construction, 19,000. Farooqi, among other economists, said the strong report bolsters the Federal Reserve's case for a half percentage point interest rate increase in May in an effort to curtail inflation. That would be the largest increase in more than two decades.   Several forces appeared to set the stage for more robust payroll gains in March. Persistent worker shortages likely spurred companies to pull forward their normal spring hiring sprees to get a jump on the competition, says Goldman Sachs economist Spencer Hill.

It's also prodding people on the sidelines, to return to a worker-friendly labor market with near-record job openings and sharply rising wages.

Frankly, it’s difficult to imagine a time when Americans are more in need of that breathing room with $5 to $7-per-gallon gasoline compounding the record prices they were already paying for other goods and services. It also occurs to me that the president may also be in need of his own breathing room – not from the economic nightmare crushing ordinary families, but rather from the artificial, zero-sum game that has us stuck there. Washington has become predictably uninspired with its insistence that adopting one set of ideas excludes the possibility of all others. Take Biden's insistence on shutting down the Canada-to-U.S. pipeline on his very first day in office. Despite pipelines being the safest, most effective means of transporting oil, he was forced into a Washington, D.C., construct of scrapping it entirely for the sake of his climate agenda. This decision left the families whose livelihoods depended on the pipeline, and now all Americans, feeling the squeeze of a domestic energy program run dry with no breathing room at all. Columnist Rex Huppke:Two GOP governors stood up to anti-transgender legislation. We need more. Or consider the Biden administration’s failure to hold auctions of oil and gas leases on federal lands as required by law. This stall tactic has cost North Dakota and other energy-producing states tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue, while sending a chilling signal to would-be investors and operators alike. Fortunately for the president, North Dakota provides a way forward. In our pledge to become both carbon-neutral by 2030 and a leader in domestic energy, we have shown that fresh thinking outside of Washington demonstrates that we do not need to choose between environmental stewardship and lower costs with less foreign reliance for American consumers.  Through innovation, not regulation, we are pumping out oil to combat soaring gas prices, while also pumping carbon emissions right back into the ground where it can be permanently stored – up to 252 billion tons of carbon dioxide, which is enough to store over 50 years' worth of our entire nation's annual CO2 production. Biden stated the obvious:Putin must not remain in power, free to destroy Ukraine During a recent visit to our state, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm even marveled that North Dakota's energy and enormous carbon storage capability were ""a gift to the planet."" With billions of barrels of recoverable oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas reserves, we can expand our major role in our nation's energy security. We are cracking the code on clean, reliable energy production in North Dakota. To take a yacht or not?:Why it may not be legal to seize Russian oligarchs' property. Where has Washington’s outdated, binary way of thinking gotten us? Holding our breath. At a critical moment in history, America finds itself shopping from a marketplace of our global adversaries to increase our energy supply, all while undermining the administration’s clean energy goals and “buy American” directives.

2022-04-01 10:01:08+00:00,President Biden has options for increasing energy supply. He just needs to use them.,"USA TODAY, Doug Burgum",USA Today,usa-today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/2022/04/01/biden-gas-prices-energy-pipeline-north-dakota-doug-burgum/7159628001/,Gas prices are up across the nation as the war in Ukraine rages and energy costs rise.

Frankly, it’s difficult to imagine a time when Americans are more in need of that breathing room with $5 to $7-per-gallon gasoline compounding the record prices they were already paying for other goods and services. It also occurs to me that the president may also be in need of his own breathing room – not from the economic nightmare crushing ordinary families, but rather from the artificial, zero-sum game that has us stuck there. Washington has become predictably uninspired with its insistence that adopting one set of ideas excludes the possibility of all others. Take Biden's insistence on shutting down the Canada-to-U.S. pipeline on his very first day in office. Despite pipelines being the safest, most effective means of transporting oil, he was forced into a Washington, D.C., construct of scrapping it entirely for the sake of his climate agenda. This decision left the families whose livelihoods depended on the pipeline, and now all Americans, feeling the squeeze of a domestic energy program run dry with no breathing room at all. Columnist Rex Huppke:Two GOP governors stood up to anti-transgender legislation. We need more. Or consider the Biden administration’s failure to hold auctions of oil and gas leases on federal lands as required by law. This stall tactic has cost North Dakota and other energy-producing states tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue, while sending a chilling signal to would-be investors and operators alike. Fortunately for the president, North Dakota provides a way forward. In our pledge to become both carbon-neutral by 2030 and a leader in domestic energy, we have shown that fresh thinking outside of Washington demonstrates that we do not need to choose between environmental stewardship and lower costs with less foreign reliance for American consumers.  Through innovation, not regulation, we are pumping out oil to combat soaring gas prices, while also pumping carbon emissions right back into the ground where it can be permanently stored – up to 252 billion tons of carbon dioxide, which is enough to store over 50 years' worth of our entire nation's annual CO2 production. Biden stated the obvious:Putin must not remain in power, free to destroy Ukraine During a recent visit to our state, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm even marveled that North Dakota's energy and enormous carbon storage capability were ""a gift to the planet."" With billions of barrels of recoverable oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas reserves, we can expand our major role in our nation's energy security. We are cracking the code on clean, reliable energy production in North Dakota. To take a yacht or not?:Why it may not be legal to seize Russian oligarchs' property. Where has Washington’s outdated, binary way of thinking gotten us? Holding our breath. At a critical moment in history, America finds itself shopping from a marketplace of our global adversaries to increase our energy supply, all while undermining the administration’s clean energy goals and “buy American” directives. Unlike many American families facing impossible choices, President Biden has options – and they start with breathing new life into the innovation happening right in his own backyard.

Taylor Wilson: Good morning, and Happy April Fools' Day. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 1st of April 2022. Today, a look at Biden's release of oil from emergency reserves. Plus the US will find out who they play in this year's World Cup and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ President Joe Biden has ordered the release of up to 180 million barrels of oil from the country's emergency reserves. The announcement yesterday came amid record high gas prices around the country, which have especially soared during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Joe Biden: Look, the bottom line is this. Between rapping up, ramping up production in the short term and driving down demand in the long term, we can free ourselves from our dependence on imported oil from across the world. Look, I know gas prices are painful. I get it. My plan's going to help ease that pain today and safeguard against tomorrow. The action is the largest release from the reserve in it's nearly 50-year-history. Producer PJ Elliott met up with White House correspondent Michael Collins, to find out more. Michael Collins: Specifically, what he's doing, he's going to release one million barrels a day from the strategic petroleum reserve for the next six months, and that will be the largest release from this emergency stockpile of oil reserves in the reserve's nearly 50-year-history. The reason that he's doing this, of course, is because gas process are at record highs. They've been on the rise again, particularly in the month since Russia started its war in Ukraine. AAA says that the average price per gallon is about $4 and 22 cents across the country. But in some states, it's even higher. In California, for example, it's well over $6 per gallon. PJ Elliott: Is there any reason why it's taken so long for this to get done? I think there are a number of reasons that the President is doing this now. Probably the biggest reason, of course, is that the gas prices are on the rise again, and one of the reasons for that is Russia's war against Ukraine. Gas prices have been on the rise since Russia invaded Ukraine about a month ago. And one of the reasons for that is this war has taken a lot of Russian oil off the market. And with that oil being off the market, that means there is a shortage, and then of course, gas prices go up. The rationale for releasing oil from the strategic reserves is you put more oil back in the system. And in theory at least, that will lower prices at the pump. Is there a timeframe that people can start to see the prices go down? Not really. The President has been asked that question and nobody seems to really have an answer. The President seems pretty certain that gas prices will drop, but he doesn't know how low they'll drop. And he said nor can he predict how soon it might be before Americans would see some relief. It probably will take time because it takes a while for that oil to get into the system and for it to make a difference. Biden also plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost US production of minerals used in electric vehicles. Russian troops are continuing to retreat from around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Troops there are now at about 20% the force initially sent to seize the city, according to a US Defense official. But The Pentagon believes Russia is pulling back to resupply, not to wind down the war. Spokesman John Kirby. John Kirby: We do believe, again, that a small number are beginning to reposition. It's not exactly clear where they're going to go, for how long, and for what purpose, but we don't see any indication that they're going to be sent home. The best assessment we have, and it's an assessment at this early stage, is that they're going to be repositioned probably into Belarus to be refit and resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine. Russian troops also handed control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant back to Ukraine, more than a month after taking over the contaminated site. Ukraine state power company, Energoatom, said the Chernobyl pullout came after Russian soldiers received significant doses of radiation after digging trenches in the exclusion zone around the closed plant, though there was no independent confirmation of that. Some places are using brief reprieves from violence to clean up. There are still reports of shelling around the Northeastern City of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second most populated city. But residents there are also seeing more spells of quiet than the first weeks of war. This week, they finally had the chance to clean up from a devastating Russian airstrike that killed at least eight people a month ago near a transport equipment plant. Volunteers like Vyacheslav Salnikov have signed up across the city to help with similar cleanups. Taylor Wilson translating for Vyacheslav Salnikov: ""Of course, it's important to help somehow. It's our city, our country. Not everyone can fight. Some people are fighting on this front as well."" In his nightly address yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian forces are building up for new, powerful attacks in the Southeast. That region has been slammed by Russian attacks basically since the beginning of Russia's invasion in February. Residents in one of the hardest hit, Mariupol, continue to try and evacuate. But a convoy of 45 buses heading there to help people escape was blocked by Russian forces this week. Other convoys bringing in supplies were also blocked. More than half of the city's 430,000 pre-war residents have been able to flee, but other relief efforts continue to be stopped by Russian forces. More broadly, peace negotiations will continue today in Turkey, but progress on that front has been slow. One of the recent Western leaders to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin was Italian Premier Mario Draghi. He spoke by phone with Putin and said the Russian leader felt conditions were not yet ripe for a ceasefire. Putin also said he was not ready for a meeting with Ukraine's President's Zelenskyy until negotiators do more work. A new threat has emerged for US lakes and rivers, and your lawn or toilets may be partly to blame. Sarah Bowman, an environmental reporter for the Indy Star, part of the USA TODAY network, has more. Sarah Bowman: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, which passed in 1972. And when that passed, there was a lot of focus on addressing industrial pollution and contamination, that kind of contamination that we think of that comes out of a pipe. And a lot of gains were made there. A lot of improvements were realized as a result of that act. But now, 50 years later, we're looking at what is the state of our waterways because we haven't achieved a lot of the goals that were set out when the Clean Water Act was passed, and trying to look at, why haven't we achieved those goals? Where are we falling short? And the big problem now is traced back to what is called non-point source pollution or pollution that isn't coming out of a pipe, that's easy. But this is pollution that's coming from runoff, be it from our roads and parking lots, that's rain and water is picking up oils and other contaminants there. It's coming from the nutrients in the bacteria in fertilizer that's coming off of farm fields or sewage that is leaking out of septic tanks. It's coming from these pollution sources that are much harder to pin down. And so it's much harder to find the source. And without being able to find the source, it's much harder to fix it or address the problem. And that's kind of where we are now when it comes to our waterways. That's not to say we don't still have industrial pollution. We do for sure. But one of the major threats to our waterways that we're trying to figure out now is these sources that are coming, very spread out from across the state of Indiana where I am and the country. Definitely don't think it's too late. And a lot of, I think, environmental advocates and scientists, researchers, experts out there would say the same thing. That being said, how to fix it, it's not an easy solution. Some folks are talking about trying to make a change to an amendment, to the Clean Water Act, to try and close some of the gaps or loopholes, if you will, to try and make it easier to regulate these types of pollution sources. Obviously, that takes an act of Congress, which is not always the easiest thing to do, to make happen. Others are talking about just needing... We need to start with additional testing of our waterways so much. There are certain requirements laid out about testing, but given resources, a lot of times it happens really infrequently. And the vast majority of our waterways aren't even tested, so we actually don't even know whether they're in good shape or bad shape. You can find more of Sarah on Twitter, @IndyStarSarah. That's Sarah with an H. Happy World Cup draw. Today's the day we'll find out who plays who in the group stage of this fall's soccer World Cup in Qatar. Groups are decided by a somewhat random draw, but it's not completely random. The teams that have qualified have now been placed into four pots based on FIFA rankings, which were updated yesterday. Each World Cup group will have one team from each pot. In pot one are the host Qatar, who we know will end up in group A. Also in pot one, some of the world's top teams, including the defending champions, France, along with Brazil, England, Belgium, and others. In pot two, the United States. There are also world powers like Germany and the Netherlands and Mexico. Pot three has Japan and recent Africa Cup of Nations Champions, Senegal, among others, though pot four is where things get weird. The final three spots have not yet been decided and will not in time for today's draw. There's still one spot up for grabs out of Europe. Wales will play the winner of Scotland and Ukraine, a game that was postponed because of the ongoing war there. That'll likely be played in June, though there's no set date. We're also waiting on the winner of Costa Rica and New Zealand. Costa Rica made it to the intercontinental playoff by finishing fourth in the North and Central American region, while New Zealand won Oceanic qualifying. That game is set for June 13th and will also take place in Qatar. And finally, we're waiting for Peru to play the winner of Australia and the United Arab Emirates out of the Asia region. That game is also set for June 13th after Australia and UAE play each other on June 7th. None of that scheduling weirdness is common and has mostly been caused by congested fixtures, thanks to COVID-19. Also it's thanks to an odd fall World Cup in Qatar, which is being played at that time because of the heat there, even though the Cup is usually played in the summer. You can find out who the US gets today at noon Eastern at 9:00 AM Pacific, streaming live on fifa.com and Peacock. The Women's Final Four tips off tonight in college basketball, and Cinderella was not invited. All four semi-finalists are some of the games' heavyweights. That includes three No. 1 seeds and a No. 2. But despite no underdog magic, the games themselves could be classics. First up, No. 1 South Carolina plays No. 1 Louisville at 7:00 PM Eastern. Carolina was the overall No. 1 seed in the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll all season, but Louisville is hungry for its first title ever. That's followed by No. 1 seed Stanford trying to repeat as champions against No. 2 Yukon, once the sport's cream of the crop, though they haven't won at all since 2016. You can catch the games on ESPN. And you can find 5 Things seven mornings a week wherever you're listening right now.

Groups are decided by a somewhat random draw, but it's not completely random. The teams that have qualified have now been placed into four pots based on FIFA rankings, which were updated yesterday. Each World Cup group will have one team from each pot. In pot one are the host Qatar, who we know will end up in group A. Also in pot one, some of the world's top teams, including the defending champions, France, along with Brazil, England, Belgium, and others. In pot two, the United States. There are also world powers like Germany and the Netherlands and Mexico. Pot three has Japan and recent Africa Cup of Nations Champions, Senegal, among others, though pot four is where things get weird. The final three spots have not yet been decided and will not in time for today's draw. There's still one spot up for grabs out of Europe. Wales will play the winner of Scotland and Ukraine, a game that was postponed because of the ongoing war there. That'll likely be played in June, though there's no set date. We're also waiting on the winner of Costa Rica and New Zealand. Costa Rica made it to the intercontinental playoff by finishing fourth in the North and Central American region, while New Zealand won Oceanic qualifying. That game is set for June 13th and will also take place in Qatar. And finally, we're waiting for Peru to play the winner of Australia and the United Arab Emirates out of the Asia region. That game is also set for June 13th after Australia and UAE play each other on June 7th. None of that scheduling weirdness is common and has mostly been caused by congested fixtures, thanks to COVID-19. Also it's thanks to an odd fall World Cup in Qatar, which is being played at that time because of the heat there, even though the Cup is usually played in the summer. You can find out who the US gets today at noon Eastern at 9:00 AM Pacific, streaming live on fifa.com and Peacock. The Women's Final Four tips off tonight in college basketball, and Cinderella was not invited. All four semi-finalists are some of the games' heavyweights. That includes three No. 1 seeds and a No. 2. But despite no underdog magic, the games themselves could be classics. First up, No. 1 South Carolina plays No. 1 Louisville at 7:00 PM Eastern. Carolina was the overall No. 1 seed in the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll all season, but Louisville is hungry for its first title ever. That's followed by No. 1 seed Stanford trying to repeat as champions against No. 2 Yukon, once the sport's cream of the crop, though they haven't won at all since 2016. You can catch the games on ESPN. And you can find 5 Things seven mornings a week wherever you're listening right now. Thanks to PJ Elliott for his great work on the show, and I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY."

First things first: What is a housing bubble? It's a period marked by an unusual spike in housing prices fueled by high demand and low supply, speculation by investors and exuberant spending. These bubbles are caused by a variety of factors, including rising prosperity, low interest rates, more mortgage product offerings and easy to access credit. And in this case, historically low housing inventory. “If many buyers share this belief, purchases arising from a ‘fear of missing out’ can drive up prices and heighten expectations of strong house-price gains,"" according to the researchers.

President Joe Biden’s move to release up to 180 million barrels of oil over six months – the largest release to date – from the nation's emergency reserves is a step in the right direction to help lower record-high gas prices, petroleum experts said Thursday, but it’s likely not enough for consumers to see relief at the pump.  “I don’t want to say it’s insignificant, but it’s not the amount we need,” says Tom Seng, an assistant professor of energy business at the University of Tulsa Collins College of Business. And while 180 million may sound like a lot, Seng says the U.S. currently is importing about 6 million barrels of oil a day, and U.S. demand has not significantly declined in the past month despite skyrocketing gas prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which currently holds about 600 million barrels, is the country’s emergency stockpile of oil, created after the oil crisis of 1973. It is managed by the Department of Energy and maintained for use during emergencies such as natural disasters and wars. It's held in giant underground salt caverns at four sites lining the Louisiana and Texas Gulf coasts. Remember last year, when Volkswagen said it was changing its name to Voltswagen? But lo and behold, the company eventually confessed on March 30, 2021, that the announcement was an April Fools' joke. That confession came after many news outlets, including USA TODAY, had asked before running stories about the name change whether the deal was a prank, but were told the announcement was legit. Getting that April Fools' Day bump in attention without harming your brand requires walking a fine line, says Columbia Business School professor and corporate strategy expert Rita McGrath.

If you'd like to get The Backstory in your inbox every week, sign up here. Here's the thing about successful women: So many have achieved great things because of adversity, not despite it. They've faced challenges or setbacks that made them fight harder, dig deeper. They've used those learnings, that grit, to achieve great things in their fields or their communities.  That's certainly true for USA TODAY's Women of the Year. We've been sharing their stories throughout March, Women's History Month. We've compiled their insights into a special video show, and next week you can hear them in a series of podcasts. Here are some of my favorite lessons from this year's honorees:  Melinda French Gates, global advocate for women and girls: ""Knowing you're going to step into something really hard and you do it anyway. Whether that's a difficult meeting or a courageous conversation or using your voice. For me, it's been using my voice on some things that maybe weren't that popular or people weren't going to like me or have a different opinion. ""Like the first time I spoke out about contraceptives. I believe in them, we use them in the United States, but I'm also Catholic. And the Catholic church doesn't necessarily condone condoms or contraceptives. So I had to learn to just go ahead and use my voice on what I knew to be true, because I had heard it from so many women around the world where I'd be meeting with them and they'd say, 'Are you kidding?

If you'd like to get The Backstory in your inbox every week, sign up here. Here's the thing about successful women: So many have achieved great things because of adversity, not despite it. They've faced challenges or setbacks that made them fight harder, dig deeper. They've used those learnings, that grit, to achieve great things in their fields or their communities.  That's certainly true for USA TODAY's Women of the Year. We've been sharing their stories throughout March, Women's History Month. We've compiled their insights into a special video show, and next week you can hear them in a series of podcasts. Here are some of my favorite lessons from this year's honorees:  Melinda French Gates, global advocate for women and girls: ""Knowing you're going to step into something really hard and you do it anyway. Whether that's a difficult meeting or a courageous conversation or using your voice. For me, it's been using my voice on some things that maybe weren't that popular or people weren't going to like me or have a different opinion. ""Like the first time I spoke out about contraceptives. I believe in them, we use them in the United States, but I'm also Catholic. And the Catholic church doesn't necessarily condone condoms or contraceptives. So I had to learn to just go ahead and use my voice on what I knew to be true, because I had heard it from so many women around the world where I'd be meeting with them and they'd say, 'Are you kidding? Why can't I get contraceptives at this little health clinic anymore? Don't you see, I have too many kids. It's a life and death situation for me. I can't feed my kids.'""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is leaving a treacherous landscape in its wake as the invading forces retreat from around Kyiv, boobytrapping streets and civilian homes. ""They are mining the whole territory, they are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until land mines could be cleared and the danger of more shelling has passed. Ukrainian troops retaking territory in the north carefully navigated streets. They attached cables to the dead bodies of civilians to pull them off the street, fearing they were boobytrapped, and placed red rags on remnants of unexploded ordnance. As talks between the nations resumed Friday, some Russian forces continued pulling away from the Ukraine capital, though Ukrainian and Western officials have warned the move is likely not a signal that the war will wind down.

It would mark the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February that the U.S. has worked to transfer tanks to Ukraine. CNN confirmed the report, citing unnamed officials who said the T-72 tanks would be delivered within ""days, not weeks.""  The report, citing an unnamed U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity, says the move was requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who held an hourlong phone call with President Joe Biden his week. The U.S. would act as an intermediary, according to the Times. The official said the tanks would allow Ukraine forces to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian targets in Donbas, which borders Russia. The White House declined to comment to USA TODAY. The transfer of tanks to the heavily contested Donbas region comes as Russia has appeared to have shifted its military focus away from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The official would not say which countries the tanks would come from, how many tanks would be sent, nor when they will arrive. Zelenskyy, who has repeatedly called on the west to increase its military assistance to Ukraine, last week singled out tanks as equipment needed by his country. In a virtual address to NATO, he said he hoped to have just “1 percent” of the alliance’s tanks and planes. - Joey Garrison A Russian group that monitors political arrests says 208 people were detained in demonstrations held Saturday across the country protesting Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. The OVD-Info group said demonstrations took place in 17 Russian cities, from Siberia to the more densely populated west. More than 70 people were were detained in Moscow and a similar number in St. Petersburg, the organization said. Video released by another group that monitors protests, Avtozak, showed some detainees being led to police prisoner transports as they smiled and carried flowers. Others were shown to be more harshly forced into the transports, bent over with their arms pinioned behind them. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government has cracked down heavily on dissent, even before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. -The Associated Press The president of Lithuania on Saturday announced it would no longer import Russian gas, making it the first nation in the European Union to achieve independence from Russian gas supplies.  “From this month on – no more Russian gas in Lithuania,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda tweeted Saturday. “Years ago my country made decisions that today allow us with no pain to break energy ties with the agressor (sic). If we can do it, the rest of Europe can do it too!” The nation’s decision comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded in March that “unfriendly countries” pay for its gas in rubles, the official Russian currency. He claimed that the West’s economic sanctions “compromised” the dollar and euro.  European leaders cautiously pushed back, insisting they would continue to pay for natural gas in euros and dollars and that they wanted to see the fine print of how the Kremlin would implement its decree. But Russia appears to be softening its demand. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that, in a Wednesday call, Putin said Germany could pay the Gazprom Bank euros for gas, which would then be transferred in rubles to Russia, German broadcaster Deutsche Well reported. - Ella Lee; The Associated Press President Joe Biden did not bring up Russia’s war in Ukraine during brief remarks Saturday morning at the Port of Wilmington during a commissioning ceremony for the USS Delaware. Biden, who is spending the weekend at his Wilmington home, spoke for just three minutes to introduce first lady Jill Biden as the official sponsor of the nuclear-powered, fast attack submarine. “I just want to say thank you for everyone involved in bringing this submarine into service,” Biden said. After the event, Biden ignored a question from a reporter on whether the U.S. will provide security guarantees for Ukraine. The president’s remarks came one week after Biden, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, declared Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” drawing backlash at home for comments that seemed inconsistent with U.S. policy. More:Was it a gaffe or an escalation? Biden prompts concern after saying Putin 'cannot remain in power' Pressed about the remark throughout the week, Biden responded that he was expressing his “moral outrage” toward Putin, not a policy change supporting regime change, and that he stands by his words. The USS Delaware, a Virginia-class submarine replacing an older Los Angeles-class submarine, was administratively commissioned underwater due to COVID-19 complications in April 2020. Saturday’s event marked the ceremonial inauguration of the 7,800-ton vessel. It’s the first time in nearly a century that Delaware has been used for the name of a U.S. Navy vessel and the first time it’s been used for a submarine. If sanctions imposed by Western countries are not lifted, Russia said it will look to end mutual cooperation on the International Space Station, according to the head of the country's space agency. In a Twitter thread Saturday, Dmitry Rogozin, Director General of Roscosmos, demanded the removal of sanctions against corporations connected to the Russian aerospace industry. The thread included responses from European Union, Canada and U.S. space agencies to Rogozin's letter. In his response, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson wrote ""sustaining safe and successful ISS operations remains a priority for the United States."" SPACEFLIGHT RECORD:NASA astronaut ends record-long, 355-day spaceflight at ISS, returns to Earth in Russian capsule But Rogozin said proposals for termination of cooperation would be presented shortly, ""From our perspective it is clear that sanctions will not be lifted,"" he wrote in a Tweet. This comes days after U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei  rode back to earth with two Russian cosmonauts, after a record-setting mission. Vande Hei's 355-day stay on the space station marked the longest single spaceflight by an American. - Ana Faguy Maksim Levin, a prominent Ukrainian photojournalist who went missing last month, has been found dead. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said Saturday on Telegram he was “killed by servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces with two shots from small arms.” That could not be independently verified by USA TODAY. His body was found in the village of Huta Mezhyhirska in the Vyshgorod district, about 24 miles from the nation’s capital, Kyiv, the prosecutor general's office said. Levin, 40, was a photojournalist and videographer at the Ukrainian news outlet LB.ua and frequently contributed to international media like Reuters, the BBC and the Associated Press.  ""Every Ukrainian photographer dreams of taking a photo that will stop the war,"" he once said, according to his obituary in LB.ua. John Pullman, Reuters’ global managing editor for visuals, said in a statement to the Guardian that Levin’s death is a “huge loss to the world of journalism,” adding that he had contributed “compelling photos and video” to Reuters since 2013. The NGO Reporters Without Borders wrote on Twitter that Levin’s death could constitute a war crime, noting that he was unarmed and wearing a press jacket. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office is opening an investigation into his death.  - Ella Lee Serhiy Haida, governor of the Luhansk region in Ukraine, said Saturday that Russian forces shelled people evacuating besieged cities, according to CNN.  ""It is impossible to negotiate with the 'Orcs,'"" Haidai told the network, referring to the mythical monsters from J. R. R. Tolkein’s “Lord of the Rings.” ""The Russians are deliberately hitting during the evacuations. There were incoming shells near the meeting places. Fortunately, everybody is alive."" The Luhansk region governor added that several tons of humanitarian aid was delivered for civilians who could not be evacuated and is being transferred to bomb shelters. About 2,700 civilians were still evacuated from the region Saturday. The former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Putin is a war criminal,"" Carla Del Ponte told Swiss newspaper Le Temps in an interview published Saturday. TRUE OR FALSE:Fact check roundup: What's true and what's false about the Russian invasion of Ukraine The Swiss lawyer who oversaw ICC war crimes investigations in Rwanda, Syria and the former Yugoslavia, said there were clear war crimes being committed in Ukraine. She said attacks on civilians, the destruction of civilian buildings and even that of entire towns, were other war crimes. ""I hoped never to see mass graves again,"" she told the newspaper Blick, referring to the wars in former Yugoslavia. ""These dead people have loved ones who don't even know what's become of them. That is unacceptable."" - The Associated Press Dozens of Ukrainian historical sites, religious buildings and museums have sustained damage since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the United Nation’s cultural agency told AFP Friday.  Using satellite images and witness reports to verify information provided by Ukrainian officials, UNESCO confirmed 53 damaged sites – 29 religious sites, 16 historic buildings, four museums and four monuments. That toll is expected to grow since Information from the besieged port city Mariupol and the captured city of Kherson are not included on the list. So far, none of the confirmed sites are on UNESCO’s World Heritage sites list, according to AFP. Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy on Friday said the nation’s GDP dropped 16% in the first quarter of 2022 and could fall as much as 40% by year’s end.  “Russian aggression against Ukraine has completely changed our economy,” Denis Kudin, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of economy, said in a Facebook post. LATEST MANEUVERING:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine REFUGEE STORIES:New lives, foreign cities: After escaping war, hardships for Ukraine refugees are just beginning The most affected industries were ones whose work can’t be done remotely, like air and sea transportation and services where businesses work directly with consumers, he said. Still, the economy started to revitalize over the last week when businesses in “safe regions” began to reopen, Kudin said, noting that farmers have already started sowing seeds. The state economy ministry is focusing on strengthening utility and energy businesses and manufacturing companies that assist Ukraine’s military. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors are set up to evacuate people from regions under attack, Saturday, according to news reports. One corridor has been set up to evacuate people from the city of Mariupol by private transportation. Buses are set to ferry Mariupol residents out of Berdyansk on another route. Mariupol currently lacks water, gas, power, internet and cell service. At least 150,000 are believed to be stranded in the southern Ukrainian city. Humanitarian corridors will also open in Severodonetsk and Popasna, the reports said. After failing to reach the war-battered city of Mariupol Friday, an International Committee of the Red Cross team said it plans to try again Saturday to evacuate civilians Friday. Three vehicles and nine personnel could not reach Mariupol to assist in the safe passage of civilians. The ICRC said the team had to return to Zaporizhzhia after they couldn't proceed with arrangements as planned. More:The devastation of Mariupol The organization had previously said tens of thousands of people were depending on the Mariupol operation. ICRC described their role as a neutral intermediary to accompany individuals out of Mariupol and into another Ukrainian city. Pope Francis said Saturday he was considering a visit to the capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv. While on a flight from Rome to Malta, a reporter asked the pope if he was considering invitations made by Ukrainian authorities. His response? ""Yes it is on the table."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, and Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican Andirv Yurash are among those who have invited Francis. The pope has spoken with Zelenskyy and Shevchuk by phone. Last Friday, Francis prayed for peace in Ukraine before an estimated crowd of 3,500 at St. Peter's Basilica. ""Free us from war, protect our word from the menace of nuclear weapons,"" he said. The U.S. Department of Defense announced Friday evening it will provide an additional $300 million in military equipment to Ukraine. ""This decision underscores the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia's war of choice,"" said John Kirby, Defense Department press secretary. Kirby said the equipment will include laser-guided rocket systems, unmanned aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition, night vision gear and medical supplies. The equipment adds to the $1.6 billion in U.S. aid money to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, he said. Vyacheslav Gladkov, regional governor of Belgorod, wrote on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian helicopters conducted an airstrike late Thursday on the oil facility in Belgorod, about 21 miles from Russia’s border with Ukraine.  Gladkov first wrote that two oil workers were injured but later said there were no victims. And Rosneft, the Russian oil firm that owns the fuel depot, said in a separate statement that no one was hurt in the fire, according to Reuters.  Kyiv has denied any involvement in the attack. ""For some reason they say that we did it, but according to our information this does not correspond to reality,"" Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Ukrainian television. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to comment on whether he ordered the alleged attack during an interview on Fox News. Zelenskyy said he does not discuss any orders he issues as commander in chief.   Contributing: The Associated Press "

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to comment on whether he ordered the alleged attack during an interview on Fox News. Zelenskyy said he does not discuss any orders he issues as commander in chief.   Contributing: The Associated Press "

Ukrainians returning to Kyiv as Russian forces pulled out over the weekend found a shocking trail of destruction and death, including slain civilians lying on the streets with their hands bound. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, said on Facebook that the bodies of 410 civilians were removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of the dead were found on the streets of Bucha – about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv – and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a “scene from a horror movie.” Arestovych said some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told Agence France-Presse that 280 people had been buried in mass graves in the city, and reporters from the news organization counted at least 20 bodies on one street. Zelenskyy said Sunday that the deadly attacks on civilians – including evidence of a massacre in Bucha – are more proof that Russia is committing ""genocide"" in his country. Noting that Ukraine's population includes more than 100 nationalities, Zelenskyy told CBS' ""Face The Nation"" that Russia's actions are ""about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities. We are citizens of Ukraine, and we don't want to be subdued to the policy of the Russian Federation."" While Russia redeploys troops in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for a total Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. There are no signs Russia would consider such a move as part of peace talks. ""This is the bare minimum that we have to start the de-occupation with,"" he said.  USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone.

Italy gets 40% of its natural gas from Russia. ►At the conclusion of a two-day trip to Malta, Pope Francis urged about 20,000 people in attendance during a Sunday Mass to “think of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the martyred Ukraine, which continues to be bombarded in this sacrilegious war.” ►The president of Lithuania on Saturday announced it would no longer import Russian gas, making it the first nation in the European Union to achieve independence from Russian gas supplies.  ►Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland’s ruling conservative party, said he's open to the permanent stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in his country as a deterrence against Russian aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the 64th Grammy Awards Sunday, speaking in a pre-recorded segment shown at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena before John Legend performed a tribute to the war-torn country. Zelenskyy urged music artists assembled to ""tell our story"" of his country facing a humanitarian crisis since Russia's invasion in February. He described the devastating impact on life and music.  ""The war. What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people. Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars,"" said Zelenskyy.

""We can't become numb to this, we can't normalize this,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together,"" he said. Blinken did a round of Sunday show as news organizations flashed pictures of slain civilians and property destruction after Russian troops withdrew from Bucha, near Kyiv. He described the Bucha massacre as a ""punch in the gut."" The secretary of state expressed cautious optimism about signs of Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv. He noted that the Russians also appear to be redeploying to the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. ""They could be regrouping,"" Blinken said. Either way, Blinken said the war has already been a ""dramatic strategic setback"" for Russia, and that the Ukrainian people have made it clear they will not be subjugated by a Russian occupation. – David Jackson As Ukrainian forces moved to retake control of areas surrounding Kyiv from retreating Russians, they proceeded with caution to avoid unexploded ordnance and boobytrapped streets and homes, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukraine officials said. Zelenskyy said Russians were leaving behind a ""catastrophic"" situation: land mines in streets, civilian homes and even on dead civilian bodies. Ukrainian soldiers were removing bodies from the streets with caution. Residents of the town of Bucha said civilians were killed without apparent provocation.  The European Union will level new sanctions in the wake of killings of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, the president of the European Council said Sunday. Charles Michel, tweeting about ""haunting images"" out of Bucha, said ""further EU sanctions & support are on their way."" Several other European leaders condemned the atrocities, and Germany’s defense minister even suggested the EU consider banning Russian gas imports, which many of the member countries depend on. The EU is helping Ukraine and nongovernmental organizations gather evidence for investigations of Russia by international courts for its actions in Ukraine, he said. The U.N.'s International Court of Justice last month ruled that Russia should ""immediately suspend"" its military operations in Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko is among the officials accusing Russia of war crimes, telling the German newspaper BILD: ""What happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.'' In an interview published Saturday, the former chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunals, Carla Del Ponte, called for an international arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Putin is a war criminal,” she told Swiss newspaper Le Temps. – Katie Wadington In the age of social media and widespread disinformation, a new weapon has emerged to counter aggression by a foreign power – the revelation of intelligence secrets. The kind of assessments that were previously kept under wraps are now being shared by U.S. and British intelligence agencies in an effort to expose what is happening on the battlefield – and inside the Kremlin – during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even before the war began Feb. 24, U.S. officials detailed Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans to attack Ukraine and create a false flag operation as a pretext for going to war. This past week, the U.S. publicized its findings that Putin was being misled by his military advisers, and Britain's spy chief said demoralized Russian troops were refusing to carry out orders and sabotaging their own equipment. Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at University College London, said the public intelligence campaign “reflects the fact that we now live in a different age, politically and internationally. And this is a different kind of war.” Russia's war in Ukraine is widely blamed for a drastic increase rise in gas prices. The vehicles the fuel goes into are getting more expensive as well. The global auto industry has yet to overcome the pandemic-induced shortage of computer chips and other vital parts that has shrunk production, slowed deliveries and sent prices for new and used cars soaring. Now it faces another major challenge. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, a key producer of electrical wiring, has led to a scarcity of that vital component. And if Russian exportation of metals such as palladium for catalytic converters and nickel for electric vehicle batteries gets disrupted or halted, the cost of vehicles amid surging demand figures to continue rising. Mark Fulthorpe, an executive director for S&P Global, expects a tight supply and high prices well into 2023.  “Until inflationary pressures start to really erode consumer and business capabilities, it’s probably going to mean that those who have the inclination to buy a new vehicle, they’ll be prepared to pay top dollar,” Fulthorpe said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby on Sunday dismissed questions surrounding Friday’s explosion at a Russian fuel depot in Belgorod. The attacked facility housed civilian-used petroleum. While the Russians have pinned the attack on Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declined to take responsibility for it. The attack was the first inside Russia since it invaded its neighbor Feb. 24. Kirby, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" also declined to attribute the attack to the Ukrainians: ""I’ll let (Zelenskyy) speak to the operations that they conduct, that’s the appropriate thing. We want to preserve as much of their operational security as we can.” The Pentagon spokesman emphasized that the Ukrainians have a right to defend themselves and that the U.S. is focused on helping them do that. ""Russia is the aggressor and they are attacking inside Ukraine, very very brutally,"" Kirby said. ""It’s not just that they're hitting oil and weapons depots and airfields, I mean they’re hitting residential areas, they’re killing civilians."" – Ana Faguy Russian forces launched an airstrike Sunday on the Black Sea port of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, sending up clouds of dark smoke that veiled parts of the city. The Russian military said the targets were an oil processing plant and fuel depots around Odesa, which is Ukraine's largest port and home to its navy. ""I live in that eight-floor building. At 6 in the morning, Russia launched an attack, and this piece of rock reached my house,” said Maiesienko Ilia, who lives near one of the targeted facilities. The Odesa city council said Ukraine’s air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack. The smaller port of Mariupol, located to the east on the Sea of Azov, remained cut off from the rest of the country as Russian and Ukrainian soldiers fought for control of the besieged city. About 100,000 civilians, less than a quarter of the prewar population of 430,000, are believed to be trapped there with little or no food, water, fuel and medicine. – Associated Press Russia's top negotiator in talks with Ukraine says it’s too early to talk about a meeting between the countries’ leaders. Vladimir Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul, said “there is still a lot of work to do” to finalize a draft agreement before Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could meet. In remarks carried Sunday by the Interfax news agency, Medinsky reaffirmed that the parties reached a tentative agreement on the need for Ukraine to adopt a neutral status and refrain from holding foreign military bases in exchange for international security guarantees. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist regions in Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. Ukraine has regained control over some areas of the Kyiv region as Russian forces pulled back over the last few days. But leaders warn this does not signal that Russia is giving up; rather, forces could be refueling and shifting their strategy to the Donbas region and the south of Ukraine. In his nightly video address Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were not allowing the Russians to retreat without a fight: “They are shelling them. They are destroying everyone they can.” Meanwhile, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, said Saturday that the capital was ""liberated"" from invading Russian forces. ""Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader,"" she said in a Facebook post. The Biden administration intends to work with allies to provide Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine to help its defense in the eastern Donbas region, according to a report from The New York Times. CNN confirmed the report, citing unnamed officials who said the T-72 tanks would be delivered within ""days, not weeks.""  The report, citing an unnamed U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity, says the move was requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who held an hourlong phone call with President Joe Biden this week. The U.S. would act as an intermediary, according to the Times. The official said the tanks would allow Ukraine forces to conduct long-range artillery strikes on Russian targets in Donbas, which borders Russia.

Ukrainians returning to Kyiv as Russian forces pulled out over the weekend found a shocking trail of destruction and death, including slain civilians lying on the streets with their hands bound. Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, said on Facebook that the bodies of 410 civilians were removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of the dead were found on the streets of Bucha – about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv – and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a “scene from a horror movie.” Arestovych said some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, rape and burning. Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told Agence France-Presse that 280 people had been buried in mass graves in the city, and reporters from the news organization counted at least 20 bodies on one street. Zelenskyy said Sunday that the deadly attacks on civilians – including evidence of a massacre in Bucha – are more proof that Russia is committing ""genocide"" in his country. Noting that Ukraine's population includes more than 100 nationalities, Zelenskyy told CBS' ""Face The Nation"" that Russia's actions are ""about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities. We are citizens of Ukraine, and we don't want to be subdued to the policy of the Russian Federation."" While Russia redeploys troops in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for a total Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. There are no signs Russia would consider such a move as part of peace talks. ""This is the bare minimum that we have to start the de-occupation with,"" he said.  USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone.

Zelenskyy urged music artists assembled to ""tell our story"" of his country facing a humanitarian crisis since Russia's invasion in February. He described the devastating impact on life and music.  ""The war. What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people.

""We can't become numb to this, we can't normalize this,"" Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together,"" he said. Blinken did a round of Sunday show as news organizations flashed pictures of slain civilians and property destruction after Russian troops withdrew from Bucha, near Kyiv. He described the Bucha massacre as a ""punch in the gut."" The secretary of state expressed cautious optimism about signs of Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv. He noted that the Russians also appear to be redeploying to the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. ""They could be regrouping,"" Blinken said. Either way, Blinken said the war has already been a ""dramatic strategic setback"" for Russia, and that the Ukrainian people have made it clear they will not be subjugated by a Russian occupation. – David Jackson As Ukrainian forces moved to retake control of areas surrounding Kyiv from retreating Russians, they proceeded with caution to avoid unexploded ordnance and boobytrapped streets and homes, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukraine officials said. Zelenskyy said Russians were leaving behind a ""catastrophic"" situation: land mines in streets, civilian homes and even on dead civilian bodies.

Eilish launched into her song in all black, and her baggy T-shirt bore the smiling image of Hawkins at the kit. As the song picked up pace, a simulated rain storm pelted the singer and her two bandmates, soaking the shirt. At the end of the performance, Eilish, smiling broadly, took her thumbs and forefingers and pinched the shirt around her collarbone and held it up to roaring applause.

""Ladies, don't fight,"" Versace announced in Italian as she marched up the steps toward the duo and seconds later whipped off part of their dresses with a flourish. The moment seemed to pay tribute to the time Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston shared the stage at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards and playfully wore identical brown gowns. In the original version, Carey and Houston milk the applause and laughs before Carey says she ""comes prepared"" for such instances, and yanks off the lower portion of her outfit, revealing a miniskirt underneath.

Surprise! Dua Lipa, Megan Thee Stallion recreate iconic Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey gag at Grammys One unexpected guest was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in a recorded message in English implored the audience to support his nation's battle against the ongoing Russian invasion. His appearance was notable because when Oscars co-host Amy Schumer suggested this very idea for the Academy Awards, it went nowhere. Although the Oscars would have been a fitting place for Ukraine's president to appear – he is after all a one-time TV actor turned national leader – Zelenskyy painted a grim picture of death and destruction, where artists sing to the wounded and dying.  ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedoes … but our music will break through anyway,"" said Zelenskyy, urging artists to ""fill the silence with your music."" The president's message was immediately followed by a performance by John Legend singing ""Free"" on a stage bathed in blue. At his side appeared Ukrainian musician Siuzanna Iglidan, who accompanied Legend's piano playing a Ukrainian stringed instrument called a bandura. The duo was joined by Ukrainian singer Mika Newton and Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk, both having only recently escaped the war. At the end of the song, viewers were directed to a donation page for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky addreses Grammys:'Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos' Lady Gaga turbocharged the standard ""Love for Sale"" as she joined a rollicking big band for what turned into a tender tribute to her longtime friend and frequent collaborator Tony Bennett, who retired from public performance last year. Bennett, 95, made a rare and apparently taped appearance at the Grammys with a very short introduction of Gaga, before blowing her a kiss. Gaga took things from there, segueing into ""Do I Love You,"" not a question but a statement of her feelings for the legend. As she sang, the screen filled with countless photos of Gaga and Bennett together over the years, with Bennett getting increasingly older while Gaga's hairstyles and color change in turn.  ""I love you, Tony, we miss you,"" Gaga said at the song's conclusion, with a close-up on her face showing signs of tears. Singer, songwriter, musician and ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" bandleader Jon Batiste looked decidedly shocked and almost perplexed after Lenny Kravitz read his name as winner of the coveted album of the year Grammy for ""We Are."" Batiste, who earlier in the show performed his infectious song ""Freedom,"" took a moment to make his way to the stage, stopping on the way to hug applauding fellow nominee Billie Eilish. Once at the microphone, Batiste used the spotlight to praise his fellow musicians and shoot down the notion of there being any true ""bests"" in a competition among creative people. ""I believe this to my core, there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor,"" he said. ""The creative arts are subjective and they reach people at a point in their lives when they need it most.

Although the Oscars would have been a fitting place for Ukraine's president to appear – he is after all a one-time TV actor turned national leader – Zelenskyy painted a grim picture of death and destruction, where artists sing to the wounded and dying.  ""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedoes … but our music will break through anyway,"" said Zelenskyy, urging artists to ""fill the silence with your music."" The president's message was immediately followed by a performance by John Legend singing ""Free"" on a stage bathed in blue. At his side appeared Ukrainian musician Siuzanna Iglidan, who accompanied Legend's piano playing a Ukrainian stringed instrument called a bandura. The duo was joined by Ukrainian singer Mika Newton and Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuk, both having only recently escaped the war. At the end of the song, viewers were directed to a donation page for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky addreses Grammys:'Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos' Lady Gaga turbocharged the standard ""Love for Sale"" as she joined a rollicking big band for what turned into a tender tribute to her longtime friend and frequent collaborator Tony Bennett, who retired from public performance last year. Bennett, 95, made a rare and apparently taped appearance at the Grammys with a very short introduction of Gaga, before blowing her a kiss. Gaga took things from there, segueing into ""Do I Love You,"" not a question but a statement of her feelings for the legend. As she sang, the screen filled with countless photos of Gaga and Bennett together over the years, with Bennett getting increasingly older while Gaga's hairstyles and color change in turn.  ""I love you, Tony, we miss you,"" Gaga said at the song's conclusion, with a close-up on her face showing signs of tears. Singer, songwriter, musician and ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" bandleader Jon Batiste looked decidedly shocked and almost perplexed after Lenny Kravitz read his name as winner of the coveted album of the year Grammy for ""We Are."" Batiste, who earlier in the show performed his infectious song ""Freedom,"" took a moment to make his way to the stage, stopping on the way to hug applauding fellow nominee Billie Eilish. Once at the microphone, Batiste used the spotlight to praise his fellow musicians and shoot down the notion of there being any true ""bests"" in a competition among creative people. ""I believe this to my core, there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor,"" he said. ""The creative arts are subjective and they reach people at a point in their lives when they need it most. It's like a song or an album is made and it's almost like it has a radar to find the person when they need it the most.""

Biden joined a growing chorus of world leaders who condemned Russia after Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In Bucha, 280 people were buried in mass graves, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who visited the city Monday. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court moved one step closer to confirmation Monday afternoon. The 22-member Senate Judiciary Committee, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, voted along party lines for an 11-11 tie, rather than offering a ""favorable"" or ""unfavorable"" recommendation. While the tie vote adds an additional procedural step, it won't stop Jackson's nomination from moving to the full Senate for consideration. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., can now set the schedule for a full chamber vote, where Jackson is expected to be confirmed before Congress leaves for Easter recess at the end of the week.  The Short List is free, but several stories we link to are subscriber-only.

More than 100 rounds were fired early Sunday in downtown Sacramento amid a chaotic altercation outside the city's entertainment district, which was packed with people leaving bars. The Sacramento County coroner identified the six victims killed in the attack as three women: Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; and Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21; and three men, Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; and Devazia Turner, 29.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Tuesday, April 5, as Russia's invasion continues. President Joe Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and more sanctions against Russia following new reports of atrocities in Ukraine after Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv. ""We saw what happened in Bucha. He is a war criminal,” Biden told reporters when returning to the White House from Delaware. His State Department later said the barbaric acts were not rare individual instances but rather ""part of a broader, troubling campaign.'' Biden joined a growing chorus of world leaders on Monday who condemned Russia after Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In Bucha, 280 people were buried in mass graves, according to Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who visited the city Monday. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha. Russian authorities have dismissed images of the dead civilians as fake. ARE ATROCITIES A GAME CHANGER? Atrocities near Kyiv fuel global outrage. Will it be a tipping point in the war? Leaders and top government officials in France, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, Poland, Estonia, Japan, New Zealand and the EU's top diplomat condemned the actions, and the U.N.

Latest developments: ►More than 1,500 civilians were evacuated Monday from the devastated port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. However, a Red Cross-accompanied convoy of buses was again thwarted in its effort to deliver supplies and evacuate residents, Vereshchuk said. ►The Ukrainian government says 18 journalists have been killed and 13 wounded in the country since the war began. In addition, eight have been abducted or taken prisoner and three are missing. ►The world's largest aircraft, longer and wider than a football field, was destroyed by a Russian attack in the early days of the war, but its makers vow to restore it. ►In his annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said managing sanctions against Russia has been an ""enormous undertaking"" and that the bank could lose $1 billion over time. The war and prior trade disputes with China ""likely will affect geopolitics for decades,"" he said. WHAT IS A NO-FLY ZONE? In Ukraine, it risks starting a war with Russia, the US and NATO say Visiting Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv, where reports of dead civilians and mass graves have come to light after Russian troops retreated, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for Russia to reach an agreement to end the war. Zelenskyy, however, also acknowledged the challenges in conducting peace talks after the killings in Bucha. ""It’s very difficult to conduct negotiations when you see what they did here,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that ""dead people have been found in barrels, basements, strangled, tortured"" in the suburb and elsewhere. The BBC reported Zelenskyy met with local residents and reiterated that Russia had committed war crimes. He also called on Western leaders to come to Bucha to see the destruction. Later, in a video address to the Romanian parliament, Zelenskyy said he fears there are places where even worse atrocities have occurred. “The military tortured people, and we have every reason to believe that there are many more people killed,” he said. “Much more than we know now.” The credible reports of torture, rape and civilian executions in Ukraine are probably not the acts of rogue soldiers, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday. '“They are part of a broader, troubling campaign,” he said at a State Department briefing. Price said the world has been shocked by “the horrifying images of the Kremlin's brutality” in Bucha and other cities near Kyiv. Civilians, many with their hands tied, were apparently executed in the streets. Others were dumped in mass graves. As they’ve retreated, Russians have also left behind land mines and booby traps to injure more Ukrainians and slow recovery, Price said. The apparent atrocities will be one of the topics of discussions when Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with his NATO counterparts in Belgium this week. Allies are already discussing additional sanctions and ways to help Ukraine document war crimes for criminal prosecution, Price said. The U.S. has contributed both money and manpower to help Ukraine’s prosecutor general compile a case. -- Maureen Groppe National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha “show further evidence of war crimes,” echoing comments from President Joe Biden and vowing the U.S. will impose new sanctions on Russia this week. “As the president said, we will work with the world to ensure there is full accountability for these crimes,” Sullivan said. “We are also working intensively with our European allies on further sanctions to raise the pressure and raise the cost on (President Vladimir) Putin in Russia.” In Bucha, corpses could be seen lying in the street, some of them with their hands tied behind their back. Other images from the Kyiv suburb showed bodies scattered in debris-strewn streets and some thrown into a mass grave.  “We do not believe that this is just a random accident or the rogue act of a particular individual,” Sullivan said, reflecting an opinion also shared by the State Department. “We believe that this was part of the plan.” Sullivan did not elaborate on the coming sanctions.  He said Putin was “surprised” the U.S. was so effective uniting the world to respond to Russia’s aggression against its neighbor. “The Russians have now realized that the West will not break,” Sullivan said, adding the next phase of the war may be protracted. “At this juncture, we believe that Russia is revising its war aims. Russia is repositioning its forces to concentrate its offensive operations in Eastern and parts of southern Ukraine, rather than target most of the territory."" -- Joey Garrison Mounting evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine have prompted calls for a European boycott of oil and gas imports from Russia, which add up to $850 million a day, essentially bankrolling President Vladimir Putin's war. Losing that source of revenue would deeply harm the struggling Russian economy and might push Putin into negotiating a peace deal, but it's not that simple, especially at a time of already soaring gasoline prices. Russia produces about 40% of the natural gas the European Union uses to heat homes and generate electricity, among other necessities, and about 25% of the oil required to fuel its vehicles. Germany, the EU's largest economy, is trying to reduce its energy dependence on Russia but still gets 40% of its gas from Moscow. Italy, another major client, gets 38% of the natural gas used for electricity and for heavy industry from Russia. They figure to wield more clout in decisions regarding future sanctions than the likes of Lithuania, which has divested itself from Russian energy. “We will likely continue to see resistance from Germany and a select few others as they’re simply far more reliant on Russian imports of oil, gas and coal,” said Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst for the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa at currency broker Oanda. “Forecasts for the impact of an embargo vary, but it would almost certainly tip the country into recession.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country will investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine as mounting reports show dead civilians outside Kyiv. The EU is offering to lend a hand. Calling it a special justice mechanism, Zelenskyy said the probe would be in conjunction with international prosecutors and judges. ""The time has come to make the war crimes committed by Russian troops the last such evil on Earth,"" he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union was prepared to help Ukraine in the investigation. ""The perpetrators of these heinous crimes must not go unpunished,"" she said in a statement after a call with Zelenskyy. Von der Leyen said the European Union would send a joint investigation team to help Ukrainian prosecutors collect evidence. The long arm of the U.S. law has reached all the way to Spain to capture one of a Russian oligarch's prized possessions. The U.S. government on Monday seized a 254-foot yacht owned by Viktor Vekselberg, an oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is the first such seizure by the Biden administration under sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Some of the sanctions target pricey assets of Russian elites. Associated Press reporters in the port of Palma de Mallorca, the capital of Spain’s Balearic Islands, watched FBI and Homeland Security agents along with members of the Spanish Civil Guard go in and out of the Tango, Vekselberg's $120 million vessel. All of Vekselberg’s assets in the United States are frozen and American companies are barred from doing business with him and his entities. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. The United States is calling for Russia's suspension from the United Nations Human Rights Council, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. The announcement comes after news of dead civilians and mass graves in Bucha, about 35 miles northwest of Kyiv. Noting the 140 countries that voted to condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, ""My message to those 140 countries: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action,"" Thomas-Greenfield said in a tweet. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said efforts to remove Russia from the council came at the direction of President Joe Biden, adding that he believes it is “ludicrous” for Russia to be a member of the body. Thomas-Greenfield said Russia should not have a position in a council that promotes human rights around the world and looks into alleged violations, where it's able to use its position as ""a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said efforts to remove Russia from the council came at the direction of President Joe Biden, adding that he believes it is “ludicrous” for Russia to be a member of the body. Thomas-Greenfield said Russia should not have a position in a council that promotes human rights around the world and looks into alleged violations, where it's able to use its position as ""a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights.""

Rapid mitigation measures – reductions in fossil fuels and better building practices – are needed to avoid unsustainable global warming, according to the report.  In fact, the report says, without immediate and deep emission reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is ""beyond reach."" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change revealed “a litany of broken climate promises” by governments and corporations and accused them of stoking global warming by clinging to harmful fossil fuels. “It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world,” he said. ""We are already perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate impacts."" Total net greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise during the years 2010-2019, according to the report.

Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are considered the most authoritative assessments of the state of global warming, its consequences and the measures being taken to tackle it. “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit),” IPCC co-chair Jim Skea said. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” PANDEMIC DECREASE OVER:Dip in carbon emissions was temporary, report says The cutoff point for data in the report was last fall, meaning the effect of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia weren’t included by the authors.

In March, the panel published a report that outlined how further temperature increases will multiply the risk of floods, storms, drought and heat waves worldwide.

Yet, a young Sen. Obama proved that one could call out to the better angels of our nature and still succeed at the highest levels of American politics. Obama circa 2008 set a bar for grace in the grit of campaigning that inspired a generation of Americans to believe in a better sort of discourse. I was one of them. Now, in 2022, we need that spirit back more than ever. It is remarkable how things fade from memory. The night Obama gave his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination, to thunderous approval from adoring supporters at Denver’s Mile High Stadium, I can remember Brit Hume on Fox News taking to the air to say that, while his network was critical of the newly minted Democratic nominee, the historic nature of the moment was something they joined the country in celebrating. When Obama, our first African American president, ultimately did prevail on Election Day, the veteran conservative commentator praised the president-elect’s oratory and his team’s effectiveness. Partisanship and faith:Religion and politics are a dangerous mix – whether it's Putin or Trump When Vice President-elect Joe Biden strode forth to shake Obama’s hand center stage, Hume had kind, if qualified, words for him as well: “We were all sitting here thinking that if Sen. Biden were allowed to make a speech now too that we could all probably go home and the morning team would be there to pick it up when he was done. Friendly fellow, we’re all fond of him, but he is a bit loquacious.” Hume’s style as a commentator evinced echoes of sportscasters like Chick Hearn or Vin Scully – one knew they were rooting for the home team, but they never failed to say something good about the other side. Today, however, it would be hard to find a mainstream conservative broadcaster willing to say anything like “we’re all fond” of Biden. Rather the euphemistic chants of “let’s go Brandon” erupt at political rallies and sporting events, spewing from the mouths of those whose contempt for a president they believe has contempt for them has overwhelmed the traditional boundaries of public decorum. This isn’t Biden’s fault. Nor is it the fault of the ordinary Republicans who revile him. We live in a moment in American life where the incentives governing political society are perverse to the point of metastasization. Yes we had four years of a President Donald Trump who (even those who love him will agree) was the most willfully divisive president in American history. But that itself is a reflection of a reality Trump exploited and exacerbated, not one that he created. Where is our fair treatment?:Conservative women are used to unequal treatment. We're successful in spite of it. An America already embroiled in cultural civil war sought gladiators to sweep aside the stifling decorum of gentler ages to exact vengeance on their political foes. In retrospect, Trump met the moment. He stepped into the arena of media sensationalism and cultural warfare and mercilessly swung the biggest sword. Yet in 2004 – a time that could only have been considered reasonable by those who could see 12 years into the future – the newly elected junior senator from Illinois was already lamenting the divisions of our age and warning against the cynicism that would lead us to accept them. As he wrote in ""The Audacity of Hope"": “Maybe the critics are right. Maybe there’s no escaping our great political divide, an endless clash of armies, and any attempts to alter the rules of engagement are futile. Or maybe the trivialization of politics has reached a point of no return. … But I don’t think so. They are out there, I think to myself, those ordinary citizens who have grown up in the midst of all the political and cultural battles, but who have found a way … to make peace with their neighbors.” The war in Ukraine:My Jewish family left an unwelcoming Ukraine, then Putin's war made me rethink my identity I was not watching when Obama burst onto the scene at the 2004 Democratic National Convention to speak what to this day are probably his most famous words. Addressing those “who would seek to divide us,” Obama declared, “there is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America! There is not a Black America, and a white America and Latino America, and Asian America, there’s the United States of America!” But going back and watching this speech as a politically disenchanted 20-year-old on the eve of Obama’s presidential run moved me toward believing in politics again. Revisiting this moment on CNN’s YouTube channel as I write this article, I note the top-ranked comment left only a year ago was from a man named Lucas: “I’m a Republican, but this speech made me proud to be an American. I wish our country was united again.” I was a liberal Democrat when I worked as a canvasser for the Obama campaign in 2008. Years later, I would shock my Democratic friends and family by becoming a Republican and running for Congress – only to shock my new Republican supporters when I told them I still believed in the Obama vision of hope and change. But going door to door in 2008, I met many Republicans and John McCain voters who felt the same way. Today, former President Obama has retired from regular public view, as is generally appropriate for former presidents to do. One has the sense of a man content to believe he did some good in office while long ago resigned to the notion that his earlier idealism was never going to be enough to prevent the escalation of our partisan warfare in ways few of us could have imagined. In his post presidential memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" Obama reflects upon the consequences of having raised Americans’ hopes so high and the failure of their efforts to sober expectations. The context was questioning whether this left the country ill prepared to contend with the painful realities of the financial collapse: “…maybe it was for the best that people couldn’t hear those cautionary notes. … Maybe what was needed was a burst of energy, no matter how fleeting ... the kind of high that could provide just enough momentum to get us through the most treacherous part of the journey.” The journey has only become more treacherous since then. We need more than a burst of energy. We need a deeper, abiding commitment to the transcendent ethos of hope and change that Obama once represented. It is up to we the people ourselves to revive this spirit. But I would welcome the former president to join us in hope again.

Yet, a young Sen. Obama proved that one could call out to the better angels of our nature and still succeed at the highest levels of American politics. Obama circa 2008 set a bar for grace in the grit of campaigning that inspired a generation of Americans to believe in a better sort of discourse. I was one of them. Now, in 2022, we need that spirit back more than ever. It is remarkable how things fade from memory. The night Obama gave his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination, to thunderous approval from adoring supporters at Denver’s Mile High Stadium, I can remember Brit Hume on Fox News taking to the air to say that, while his network was critical of the newly minted Democratic nominee, the historic nature of the moment was something they joined the country in celebrating. When Obama, our first African American president, ultimately did prevail on Election Day, the veteran conservative commentator praised the president-elect’s oratory and his team’s effectiveness. Partisanship and faith:Religion and politics are a dangerous mix – whether it's Putin or Trump When Vice President-elect Joe Biden strode forth to shake Obama’s hand center stage, Hume had kind, if qualified, words for him as well: “We were all sitting here thinking that if Sen. Biden were allowed to make a speech now too that we could all probably go home and the morning team would be there to pick it up when he was done. Friendly fellow, we’re all fond of him, but he is a bit loquacious.” Hume’s style as a commentator evinced echoes of sportscasters like Chick Hearn or Vin Scully – one knew they were rooting for the home team, but they never failed to say something good about the other side. Today, however, it would be hard to find a mainstream conservative broadcaster willing to say anything like “we’re all fond” of Biden. Rather the euphemistic chants of “let’s go Brandon” erupt at political rallies and sporting events, spewing from the mouths of those whose contempt for a president they believe has contempt for them has overwhelmed the traditional boundaries of public decorum. This isn’t Biden’s fault. Nor is it the fault of the ordinary Republicans who revile him. We live in a moment in American life where the incentives governing political society are perverse to the point of metastasization. Yes we had four years of a President Donald Trump who (even those who love him will agree) was the most willfully divisive president in American history. But that itself is a reflection of a reality Trump exploited and exacerbated, not one that he created. Where is our fair treatment?:Conservative women are used to unequal treatment. We're successful in spite of it. An America already embroiled in cultural civil war sought gladiators to sweep aside the stifling decorum of gentler ages to exact vengeance on their political foes.

Yes, the 64th annual awards in Las Vegas, which aired Sunday on CBS, honored a diverse array of performers – from song and record of the year winners Silk Sonic to best new artist Olivia Rodrigo to album of the year winner Jon Batiste. But the Recording Academy reminded us that an awards show can be inclusive in all kinds of other ways, too – something other shows like the Oscars should implement. Like, yesterday.   Performers again electrified the Grammys stage with passion and poise. The jovial Batiste. Queer artists Lil Nas X, Brandi Carlile and T.J. Osborne, half of the Brothers Osborne. Spanish-language singers J. Balvin and Maria Becerra. K-Pop sensation BTS. The soulful, swoon-worthy John Legend, joined by Ukrainian performers in a gut-wrenching tribute to the country, now under attack by Russia. Our Grammys live blog:John Legend performs tribute to Ukraine, President Zelenskyy appears virtually Viewers also glimpsed snippets of performances from lesser-known artists from the MGM Grand's rooftop across many genres, including Cuban singer Aymée Nuviola and contemporary worship group Maverick City Music. This year's show even made an effort to recognize those who rarely receive any attention at all: behind-the-scenes tour staff introduced their bosses, including Billie Eilish, Chris Stapleton and H.E.R. Even E!'s red-carpet coverage joined in on the spirit of inclusion, with sign language interpreters occasionally accompanying artists during host Laverne Cox's interviews for the benefit of deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers. What if the Oscars tamped down its attempts at relevance – like cutting eight categories from the live show and replacing that time with cringeworthy gags – and instead elevated more behind-the-scenes support staff that help make movies happen? Instead of Amy Schumer jokingly calling Kirsten Dunst a seat filler, for example, why not recognize lower-profile Oscar nominees in the short film or makeup and hairstyling categories? And a film's assistant director could introduce a montage for best picture of the year. In case you missed:Brutally honest reviews of every Grammys 2022 performance, including BTS and Billie Eilish One reminder from this year's Grammys: It's not just the biggest categories that make for the most compelling acceptance speeches. Take Jazmine Sullivan's for best R&B album. She says she wrote the project to deal with her own shame over choices she made in her 20s. But ""Heaux Tales"" blossomed into ""a safe space for Black women to tell their stories, for us to learn from each other, laugh with each other, and not be exploited at the same time,"" she said. ""And that's what I'm most grateful for. So shout-out to all Black women who are just living their lives."" (Sullivan finally won her first two Grammys this year after receiving more than a dozen nominations since 2009.) Of course, the Grammys remain imperfect. Music's biggest night has been far from immune to controversies – particularly when it comes to diversity and inclusion in its nominees and winners. Important:Marilyn Manson, Louis C.K. both won Grammys. Is this cancel culture? The past few years have brought the #GrammysSoMale hashtag, protesting the scarcity of female winners, and in response, former Recording Academy president Neil Portnow suggesting that women need to ""step up"" to be recognized; artists lamenting the awards' treatment of Black music; and K-Pop groups failing to make significant headway in major categories. The academy has made sweeping efforts to diversify its ranks, developing a task force months after its January 2018 ceremony celebrated mostly men and pop music.  See all the Grammys winners:Which stars have already won tonight It made headway last year by awarding Grammys to Beyoncé, Megan Thee Stallion and H.E.R., and it featured performances from artists like Mickey Guyton, Bad Bunny and Cardi B. The organization has also worked to diversify membership, created inclusive initiatives and eliminated its controversial nomination review committees – panels that chose nominees from a list of those who received the most votes. Nominees are now based purely on votes cast by the academy’s more than 11,000 voting members. Questions have loomed for years around the nominations process as music industry players called for more transparency. And the academy's goal is to double the number of female members by 2025, and it is more than halfway there. The awards show has also built more inclusion into its broadcast behind the scenes: The Grammys announced last fall that it had adopted an inclusion rider for the 2022 ceremony, an agreement requiring producers to audition, interview and hire people from groups that have been historically and systematically excluded from the industry. CBS also included audio description for the live telecast for the first time. ""From a 'front of camera' perspective, the Grammys appear to have been quite diverse and inclusive – from race to gender and other elements of diversity, song selections and artist performances,"" says Angela Reddock-Wright, an employment lawyer and mediator who works with the entertainment industry. ""The real question is what is happening behind the scenes and whether the Grammy organization is honoring its commitment to require an inclusion rider for the 2022 Grammys."" She notes the success of this rider has not been made public. Still, ""it appears the organization, like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, has made great strides,"" she says.

The Short List is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe to the newsletter here or text messages here. For millions of Americans, student debt limbo will continue for a few more months. President Joe Biden plans to again extend the moratorium on federal student loan payments through Aug. 31, the Associated Press reported, citing a federal official. It's the fifth extension since the pause took effect in March 2020. This time, inflation is climbing and gas prices are soaring amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. All the while, the nation’s $1.7 trillion student loan debt portfolio continues to grow, with no firm direction for the indebted. Though borrowers likely will appreciate the extra wiggle room, many have grown frustrated with the continued extensions without a plan for widespread forgiveness.  The United States and the European Union plan to impose new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for Russia’s “war crimes” in Ukraine after revelations of atrocities in towns near Kyiv. The European Union’s executive branch on Tuesday proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia, in what would be the first sanctions targeting Moscow's lucrative energy income for its war in Ukraine. The coal imports amount to an estimated $4.4 billion per year. The U.S. is also planning to team up with its European allies on further penalties, including a ban on new investments in Russia. Earlier Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council the U.N. must bring war crimes charges against Russian leaders, calling for soldiers who savagely attacked civilians – and those who issued the orders – to face trial for the apparent massacre by Russian forces in and around Kyiv and other major cities.

For decades, the identity of an elusive figure dubbed the ""Days Inn"" and ""I-65"" killer evaded police as investigators tried to solve the slayings of three women in Indiana and Kentucky in the late 1980s. But on Tuesday, law enforcement officials said they've solved the case. Indiana State Police, along with several federal and local agencies, said investigators determined that Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now dead, was responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret ""Peggy"" Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. The women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor. Investigators have also linked Greenwell through DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana, and noted there's a ""distinct possibility"" he could be linked to more unsolved cases. Greenwell died of cancer in Iowa in 2013 at age 68. President Joe Biden on Tuesday proposed a way to increase the number of dependents who can get subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a fix to what's been called the ""family glitch."" The proposal: If a workplace plan for a whole family costs more than 10% of a family's income, then the worker's spouse and children could get help purchasing a private plan through the Obamacare marketplace. ""The Affordable Care Act is stronger than it’s ever been,"" Biden said at a White House event attended by former President Barack Obama. ""And today, we’re strengthening it even further."" According to the White House, the change, which would go into effect as early as next year, could allow an estimated 200,000 people without insurance to gain coverage, and about 1 million people might be able to switch to a more affordable plan. With COVID-19 still on the mind of many Americans, there's another virus spreading around South Florida affecting a different segment of the population: dogs. Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex, also known as ""kennel cough"" or ""canine cough,"" is caused by a group of viruses and bacteria, including the flu, that affects the respiratory tract of dogs. It can also be easily spread, whether dogs live in a home or are awaiting adoption. Miami-Dade County health officials noticed an increase in dogs infected with CIRDC in March, spurring animal services on March 23 to indefinitely suspend dog adoptions, adoption events and wellness clinics. Maria Serrano, chief veterinarian at the Miami-Dade County Animal Services, said the quick response to the disease helped contain it. ⛈ Wicked weather: Severe storms battered the South on Tuesday, with golf-ball-size hail and howling winds.

Security Council the U.N. must bring war crimes charges against Russian leaders, calling for soldiers who savagely attacked civilians – and those who issued the orders – to face trial for the apparent massacre by Russian forces in and around Kyiv and other major cities.

For decades, the identity of an elusive figure dubbed the ""Days Inn"" and ""I-65"" killer evaded police as investigators tried to solve the slayings of three women in Indiana and Kentucky in the late 1980s. But on Tuesday, law enforcement officials said they've solved the case. Indiana State Police, along with several federal and local agencies, said investigators determined that Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now dead, was responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret ""Peggy"" Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. The women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor. Investigators have also linked Greenwell through DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana, and noted there's a ""distinct possibility"" he could be linked to more unsolved cases. Greenwell died of cancer in Iowa in 2013 at age 68. President Joe Biden on Tuesday proposed a way to increase the number of dependents who can get subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a fix to what's been called the ""family glitch."" The proposal: If a workplace plan for a whole family costs more than 10% of a family's income, then the worker's spouse and children could get help purchasing a private plan through the Obamacare marketplace. ""The Affordable Care Act is stronger than it’s ever been,"" Biden said at a White House event attended by former President Barack Obama. ""And today, we’re strengthening it even further."" According to the White House, the change, which would go into effect as early as next year, could allow an estimated 200,000 people without insurance to gain coverage, and about 1 million people might be able to switch to a more affordable plan. With COVID-19 still on the mind of many Americans, there's another virus spreading around South Florida affecting a different segment of the population: dogs. Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex, also known as ""kennel cough"" or ""canine cough,"" is caused by a group of viruses and bacteria, including the flu, that affects the respiratory tract of dogs. It can also be easily spread, whether dogs live in a home or are awaiting adoption. Miami-Dade County health officials noticed an increase in dogs infected with CIRDC in March, spurring animal services on March 23 to indefinitely suspend dog adoptions, adoption events and wellness clinics. Maria Serrano, chief veterinarian at the Miami-Dade County Animal Services, said the quick response to the disease helped contain it. ⛈ Wicked weather: Severe storms battered the South on Tuesday, with golf-ball-size hail and howling winds. Tornadoes were reported in two states ahead of a couple of days of wild weather expected across the nation. Check the forecast in your neck of the woods here.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday the 5th of April, 2022. Today, the latest war crimes accusation surrounding Russian president Vladimir Putin. Plus, how Amazon workers in New York unionized, and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  ♦ President Joe Biden yesterday made his latest strong statement about Russian president Vladimir Putin. President Joe Biden: You may remember, I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha, this warrants him... He is a war criminal. But we have to gather the information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this could be actual have a war crime trial. This guy is brutal and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seen it. So what would happen next if Putin were to be charged with war crimes? White House reporter Rebecca Morin has more. Rebecca Morin: President Joe Biden basically criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin as a war criminal for the recent reports of atrocities in Ukraine. He also said that he would like to see a war crimes trial against Putin. And there are discussions on more sanctions for Russia after these atrocities were reported. So at the White House press briefing, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the next step is to talk with allies on how are they going to approach a war crimes trial, whether it's with the International Criminal Court. The next really big step is gathering facts, trying to gather as much evidence that they can have for a trial. Jake Sullivan, again at the White House press briefing, said that they are going to again talk with allies on how to approach new sanctions. He did say new sanctions will be announced later this week. The West's latest cries of war crimes committed by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine come after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the town of Bucha outside Kyiv yesterday. Ukrainian officials say the bodies of hundreds of civilians were found there and other towns around the capital after the recent retreat of Russian troops. Some of the bodies lying around Bucha have been buried in a mass grave outside a church in the center of town. Father Andrii Galavin, priest at the Church of St. Andrew and All Saints in Bucha, described recent scenes. Taylor Wilson translating for Andrii Galavin: ""Under the Russian occupation, people were dying. A lot of people were killed in cars while trying to evacuate the city. A lot of people were killed by explosions and gunshots, and bodies were lying on streets. The morgue was full. It wasn't possible to bury people at the cemetery since we were not able to physically reach the cemetery. Peaceful civilians going to the cemetery could have been killed on the way."" Ukraine's military says Russian forces are preparing an increased offensive on Ukraine's Southeast as Russia looks to gain control of the country's industrial heartland called the Donbas. Today, President Zelenskyy will speak to the UN Security Council amid demands for war crime investigations. Amazon workers on Staten Island, New York voted to unionize on Friday. The move marked the first successful US organizing effort in the retail giant's history. Reactions after the vote were mixed from employees. Zion Harrison voted for unionization, Catalina Flores voted against. Zion Harrison: But this is a very hard working job. People do work a lot of hours. So working hard definitely pays off. Definitely. Catalina Flores: I personally, for someone who's saying no, it's like, okay, they won. I'm not going to be like, ""Ah, I'm going to leave Amazon,"" because of it. It is what it is. So there are some employees that said... They were so non-employee. They were pro, for union, right? And there was others who I talked to and they said, ""No, I'm not going to because nothing's guaranteed. What's the point? Nothing's going to change."" Beyond just making history at Amazon, the vote is historic in American labor history, and it might be a sign of what's to come. Professor John Logan from San Francisco State University is an expert in labor and employment studies. Professor John Logan: I think it's almost impossible to exaggerate the significance of that victory at Amazon. I mean, this really is the most important union victory in a hundred years. But the campaign itself was really remarkable because it was what I would call sort of worker-led self-organization. I mean, all of the activists in the campaign, all of the key people for Amazon warehouse workers, I'm really not sure not just that the Amazon Labor Union would not have been successful two or three years ago, I actually don't think any union would have been successful two or three years ago. We're in a different moment right now, and they were able to take advantage of that. A lot of the workers at Staten Island and also at Bessemer - we had an election down there that was very, very close - simply felt that they weren't being treated justly, they weren't being treated with respect. And the Amazon Labor Union, to its great credit, was able to convince, to persuade them that the way to get respect at work was by having a seat at the bargaining table through the Amazon Labor Union. The most direct comparison is probably Starbucks. They had two victories in Buffalo, New York last December. It's now spread to over 170 stores have filed for union elections. They've won 10 out of the 11 elections that have taken place so far. So, Amazon desperately wants to avoid that type of contagion. First contracts can be really difficult for unions. Negotiations can drag on for months and months and months because the company's deliberately through delaying tactics, through so-called hard bargaining... But Amazon is going to be in the spotlight like no other company. The American public has a far more direct relationship with Starbucks and Amazon than it ever did with General Motors or Ford in the 1930s and 1940s. About 55% of votes went in favor of the union, which was started by former employee Chris Smalls. He initially led a walkout of employees in 2020 over safety conditions amid the pandemic. He was fired after that event, with Amazon claiming it was because he violated social distancing guidelines. Amazon has generally fought hard against organizing attempts. They've used a range of efforts leading up to elections, including holding mandatory meetings where unions were criticized. Also, according to leaked company notes acquired by VICE News, Amazon had a strategy to smear Chris Smalls. A memo in response to regulatory or media inquiry about Smalls read, ""We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer's conduct was immoral, unacceptable and arguably illegal in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety. He's not smart or articulate. And to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we're trying to protect workers."" You can follow along with more coverage of the Amazon union at USATODAY.com. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to become the first Black woman on the Supreme Court moved one step closer yesterday. Politics reporter Dylan Wells has more. Dylan Wells: On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee met to vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court. And as expected, the committee split 50/50 Democrats versus Republicans on Jackson's nomination, meaning that it was a tie. And because of that, then the Senate as a whole had to vote on a motion to discharge that nomination from the committee. And they did that successfully, with 53 voting in favor, including three Republicans: Senator Susan Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Mitt Romney. And Murkowski and Romney just announced their support for Jackson on Monday. And now that that vote has happened, Jackson's nomination will be able to go in front of the full Senate this week for a vote on her confirmation. We're expecting Jackson to be confirmed when she goes before the full Senate, given that she now has these three Republicans on board, in addition to the Democratic Caucus. And it just takes a simple majority of supporters to get her over that threshold. The Senate breaks for recess on Friday, and Leader Schumer has said that this will be on the calendar before then. So she should be fully confirmed by the end of the week, barring any unexpected changes. That said, Justice Breyer, who she will be replacing on the court, has said that he will not step down until the end of the current Supreme Court term, which generally happens in the early summer. So for this short period of time, Judge Jackson will be this Supreme Court justice in the wings waiting to take her actual seat on the court until Justice Breyer steps down and officially retires. The most recent couple of confirmation hearings we've seen for Supreme Court justices has been in the case of a death of a sitting justice. For example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away. And so it is uncommon to have this kind of waiting period, which we now have because Breyer gave this notice that he would be stepping down at the end of this term. You can find a link to more of Dylan's work in today's episode description. The Kansas Jayhawks are men's college basketball champions. They took down North Carolina last night in a classic 72 to 69. Carolina led by 15 at halftime before KU came storming back in the biggest comeback in national title game history. USA TODAY Sports' Mackenzie Salmon and Scott Gleeson try to make sense of it all from New Orleans. MacKenzie Salmon: Now, before we get to can Kansas-UNC heartbreak, how did it all fall apart? Scott Gleeson: Right. So with North Carolina, I mean, being up 15 at half, basketball's a game of momentum, and what we saw in the second half is Kansas came out a completely different team. And it was almost as if there was a knockout blow in the first half and then there was a counterpunch that Kansas delivered in the second half. And you could just sort of see how, for North Carolina in their head psychologically, it was almost as if they thought that they had the championship won. So to see how Kansas really just responded, and they came out with swagger, right? Kansas did. And so I think with North Carolina, one of the things that happened was they changed and they were able to get some of the momentum back themselves. But ultimately, you could just really feel that Kansas was showing more hunger all throughout the second half. Bill Self gets his second title. What does this mean for his legacy and for the program? Right. So the thing about Bill Self is that he wins one national championship in 2008, but for so long when you win a Big 12 regular season championship, he has 16 of them, they've had six number one seeds, and a lot of those times they didn't even get to the Final Four. So he had this underachievement tag that was on him for so long, and this really sheds that. I mean, you could see the relief on Bill Self's face. You could see him when he's talking with the players what this means to him. He really just described in the press conference how this is the most special group that he's ever coached, and that just really speaks volumes to what this team means and what a championship means to him. To get that label off his back and to really go into this upper echelon of coaches who have won multiple championships, it speaks to the program and it speaks to him just showing some resilience as a head coach.

Pretty soon, you'll be paying even more for just about everything when it comes to eating in or dining out, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""All food prices are now predicted to increase,"" the USDA's Food Prices Outlook for 2022 March report said.   The increases are the highest in decades as grocery prices got more expensive and rose nearly 9% for the year. The USDA's Economic Research Service updated its March report predicting a 4.5%-5% rise in food prices this year. Eating out will see the highest increase, 5.5%-6.5%, the report said. Rising cost of eggs: Bird flu outbreak and inflation cause rising egg prices ahead of Easter and Passover Food safety: How long is food safe to eat after the best if used by date? Longer than you think. Grocery prices are expected to rise between 3% and 4% in the coming months. And that's on top of all the other increases consumers faced over the past several months.  No food category, the USDA said, decreased in price in 2021. And now the USDA revised its forecast upward for all food categories, including meats, poultry, eggs, dairy products, fats and oils, and more.

""All food prices are now predicted to increase,"" the USDA's Food Prices Outlook for 2022 March report said.   The increases are the highest in decades as grocery prices got more expensive and rose nearly 9% for the year.

Both conservative and liberal politicians are expected to pan the Biden administration’s actions.  Some Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been pressing Biden to use his executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower. As recently as March 31, dozens of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the president urging him to extend the pause through year's end and ""to provide meaningful student debt cancellation.""  But Biden has said he believes such action must come from Congress.

They sent a letter March 8 to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona urging him to restart payments as a way to address the national deficit and combat inflation. Meanwhile, borrowers are getting more insistent in their pleas for widespread loan forgiveness.

Borrowers at the demonstration said the payment pause helped them, but they wanted long-term cancellation. They said the repeated extensions make it difficult for them to plan. “The pause doesn’t change the fact that it’s still not affordable,” said Elisha DeJesus, 27, a Massachusetts therapist for children. DeJesus has about $40,000 in student loan debt. She said it would be a struggle to restart payments given recent inflation. She's also paying for gas more frequently  since she has returned to working in an office.  Life without loans:How the payment pause changed people’s lives Regardless of when payments restart, the government is expected to face challenges in getting borrowers to resume their payments.

Though it remains unclear if the president ultimately will erase student loan debt en masse, the Education Department has taken some steps to offer borrowers permanent relief. The agency is on track to cancel more than $17 billion owed by borrowers since Biden took office. That forgiveness has come through expansions of existing debt forgiveness programs, such as those for borrowers who have permanent disabilities or were defrauded by their schools.  For instance, the department announced recently it had identified about 100,000 borrowers who would benefit from changes it announced to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in October. That would clear about $6.2 billion in debt for the affected borrowers. And the government sent another $415 million to 16,000 students defrauded by for-profit universities.

But online, some people claim Ukrainians must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to qualify. “Ukraine government announce emergency payments to those impacted by war. But only if you are (vaccinated) and only through the digital system,” reads a March 22 Facebook post. The post accumulated more than 300 interactions in over a week. Accompanying the text is a video of Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal delivering a speech. Other Facebook users shared a screenshot of a March 11 TikTok video that features a clip of Shmyhal’s remarks with the text, “Are you starting to join the dots yet?” Similar versions of the claim circulated throughout March on platforms like Twitter, Bitchute and Telegram. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks  However, the posts misrepresent Shmyhal’s announcement about the relief plan. There is no COVID-19 vaccine requirement to qualify for the payment, as independent fact-checking organizations have reported. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the post for comment. The full text of the resolution behind the relief plan doesn’t reference vaccinations. And Shmyhal didn’t say during his speech that a COVID-19 vaccine would be required to collect the payment. “The program will work by analogy with payments with vaccination, that is with the help of the Diia application,” Shmyhal said March 6, according to an English interpretation of his remarks uploaded to YouTube by UATV, a Ukrainian news agency.  The Diia government app Shymhal referenced allows citizens to upload identification documents or a vaccine passport. Before the Russian invasion, the app was used to distribute payments to people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a Google translation of a December 2021 press release.  But that's not the app's only function. Users can also donate to Ukraine's military through Diia. Shymhal brought up vaccination payments to explain how the wartime payments would similarly be distributed through the eSupport program, an initiative launched by Zelenskyy to boost Ukraine's vaccination rates.  There is no mention of a vaccine requirement in instructions from Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation on how to receive the assistance. The ministry's website notes citizens who have already collected a financial incentive for receiving a COVID-19 shot are still eligible for the war payment. Fact check: No connection between Ukrainian app and World Economic Forum's 'Great Reset' In a Facebook comment March 14, Diia's page responded to a user clarifying that proof of COVID-19 vaccination is not a necessary condition for collecting the payment. Ukrainian news outlet Segodnya also reported that citizens can apply for the payment “regardless of the level of your vaccination,” according to a Google translation. Zelenskyy's March 3 announcement about the relief program states all Ukrainian citizens affected by the Russian invasion qualify for the payment and that there are no terms. “Every employee, every sole proprietor, every citizen of Ukraine, from whom Russia has taken away the opportunity to work, will receive six and a half thousand hryvnias without any conditions,” he said in the statement, according to a Google translation. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Ukraine’s emergency wartime payment is dependent on a citizen's COVID-19 vaccination status. Reports and announcements from Ukraine’s government indicate all Ukrainians impacted by the war are eligible for the payment, and there is no mention of a vaccine mandate. Shmyhal said the war payment program would be similar to Ukraine’s previous COVID-19 vaccine incentive initiative, but he did not say a vaccine is required to qualify for the relief.

There is no COVID-19 vaccine requirement to qualify for the payment, as independent fact-checking organizations have reported. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the post for comment. The full text of the resolution behind the relief plan doesn’t reference vaccinations. And Shmyhal didn’t say during his speech that a COVID-19 vaccine would be required to collect the payment. “The program will work by analogy with payments with vaccination, that is with the help of the Diia application,” Shmyhal said March 6, according to an English interpretation of his remarks uploaded to YouTube by UATV, a Ukrainian news agency.  The Diia government app Shymhal referenced allows citizens to upload identification documents or a vaccine passport. Before the Russian invasion, the app was used to distribute payments to people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a Google translation of a December 2021 press release.  But that's not the app's only function. Users can also donate to Ukraine's military through Diia. Shymhal brought up vaccination payments to explain how the wartime payments would similarly be distributed through the eSupport program, an initiative launched by Zelenskyy to boost Ukraine's vaccination rates.  There is no mention of a vaccine requirement in instructions from Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation on how to receive the assistance. The ministry's website notes citizens who have already collected a financial incentive for receiving a COVID-19 shot are still eligible for the war payment. Fact check: No connection between Ukrainian app and World Economic Forum's 'Great Reset' In a Facebook comment March 14, Diia's page responded to a user clarifying that proof of COVID-19 vaccination is not a necessary condition for collecting the payment. Ukrainian news outlet Segodnya also reported that citizens can apply for the payment “regardless of the level of your vaccination,” according to a Google translation. Zelenskyy's March 3 announcement about the relief program states all Ukrainian citizens affected by the Russian invasion qualify for the payment and that there are no terms. “Every employee, every sole proprietor, every citizen of Ukraine, from whom Russia has taken away the opportunity to work, will receive six and a half thousand hryvnias without any conditions,” he said in the statement, according to a Google translation. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Ukraine’s emergency wartime payment is dependent on a citizen's COVID-19 vaccination status. Reports and announcements from Ukraine’s government indicate all Ukrainians impacted by the war are eligible for the payment, and there is no mention of a vaccine mandate. Shmyhal said the war payment program would be similar to Ukraine’s previous COVID-19 vaccine incentive initiative, but he did not say a vaccine is required to qualify for the relief.

In Whitehouse, Texas, about 100 miles southeast of Dallas, a 71-year-old man died when storm winds toppled a tree onto his home.

The threat of damaging weather will move further north Wednesday, forecasters said, with severe storms possible across an area stretching from western Alabama to the western tip of the Carolinas. More than 10 million people in metro areas including Atlanta; Birmingham; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, will be at risk, the Storm Prediction Center said.  President Joe Biden plans to extend the moratorium on federal student loan payments through Aug. 31, the Associated Press reported, citing a federal official. For tens of millions of Americans, student debt limbo will continue another three months. The move will mark the fifth extension since the pause took effect in March 2020. This time, inflation is climbing and gas prices are soaring in connection to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The freeze saves 41 million borrowers about $5 billion a month, the Department of Education has said previously. Though borrowers likely will appreciate the extra wiggle room, many have grown frustrated with the continued extensions without a plan for widespread forgiveness. Both conservative and liberal politicians are expected to pan the Biden administration's actions.   The House will vote Wednesday on whether to hold Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, who were advisers to former President Donald Trump, in contempt of Congress after their monthslong refusal to comply with subpoenas from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. If approved as expected, the criminal referrals will be sent to the Justice Department, which would decide whether to prosecute. The House committee investigating the attack voted late last month to urge the full House to find Navarro and Scavino in contempt. Navarro, 72, a former White House trade adviser, was subpoenaed in early February over his promotion of false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election that the committee believes contributed to the attack. Scavino, a communications aide, was with Trump the day of the attack on the Capitol and may have ""materials relevant to his videotaping and tweeting"" messages that day, the committee said.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, April 7, as Russia's invasion continues. The mayor of the encircled Ukrainian city of Mariupol said more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed during the monthlong Russian siege. Vadym Boichenko said Wednesday that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, and have destroyed more than 90% of the southern port city’s infrastructure. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of the Nazi concentration camps. Russia-occupation forces turned our entire city into a death camp,"" Boichenko said, according to the Ukrainian news agency Interfax. ""This is the new Auschwitz and Majdanek."" Boichenko's estimates of the fatalities in Mariupol come on the same day the U.S. imposed sweeping new sanctions on Russia that include targeting Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters in response to atrocities in Ukraine that the White House has called war crimes. Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, two daughters of the Russian leader and his ex-wife Lyudmila Shkrebneva Putina, face full blocking sanctions that will cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they may hold in the U.S. The administration believes many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members. Sanctions also target Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's wife and daughter. The new wave of sanctions on Russian elites add to the 140 other oligarchs and Kremlin officials already hit with sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. ""We’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin,'' President Joe Biden said. USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM:Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone. Latest developments ►The U.S. House overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday calling for a federal government report on evidence of war crimes committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The legislation calls for the U.S. president to submit to Congress a report on efforts to preserve evidence related to war crimes ►Ukrainian authorities say nearly 5,000 people were evacuated from combat areas in the south or eastern part of the country. Over 10 million people, about a quarter of Ukraine’s population, have been displaced by the war, and more than 4 million of them have fled the nation. ►A North Dakota farmer jailed in Ukraine since November has been moved from Kyiv to Lviv, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said. Kurt Groszhan, 50, is charged with plotting to assassinate Ukraine’s then-agriculture minister, Roman Leschenko. The two had gone into business together after Groszhan moved to Ukraine in 2017. ►Ukraine's military said it has retaken the settlements of Dobryanka, Novovoznesenske and Trudolyubivka in the Kherson region just north of Crimea. ►$100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles will be sent to Ukraine to meet an urgent need, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The ""transfer"" comes amid a shift of fighting to eastern Ukraine. ►Greece is expelling 12 Russian diplomats. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Western countries have expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats. President Joe Biden said new economic sanctions imposed Wednesday against Russia, including two adult daughters of President Vladimir Putin, “ratchet up the pain'' further on Russia following the discovery of atrocities committed by its troops. ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said, describing scenes of bodies left in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha including civilians executed with their hands tied behind their backs.  “Responsible nations have to come together to hold these preparators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation."" The Biden administration announced sanctions on 21 Kremlin officials and Russian elites in addition to two adult Putin daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, and the wife and daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Other measures include full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank, as well as a ban on U.S. investment in Russia. European allies took similar actions. ""Think about the incredible amounts of money these oligarchs have stolen,"" Biden said, adding that they won't be able to keep their ""$100 million yachts"" and luxury homes ""while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day."" – Joey Garrison As much of the world recoils upon seeing images of the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, Moscow is turning to a well-rehearsed, long-standing strategy: Deny culpability, blame the victim, crank up the propaganda machine. In detailed broadcasts to millions of viewers, correspondents and hosts of Russian state TV channels said Tuesday that some photo and video evidence of the ghastly killings in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were fake while others showed that Ukrainians were responsible for the horrors. Some reports claimed to have video showing fake Ukrainian corpses moving, supposed evidence the deaths were staged. Accounts from eyewitnesses and foreign journalists in Ukraine, along with satellite images, belie that notion. But the disinformation can be effective in sowing confusion among the audiences, especially those in Russia whose access to independent sources of information is limited. “This is simply what Russia does every time it recognizes that it has suffered a PR setback through committing atrocities,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia program at the Chatham House think tank. “So the system works almost on autopilot.” As they put up a fierce resistance to the assaults from a much larger enemy, Ukrainian forces are far from defenseless. The additional $100 million President Joe Biden authorized this week for military aid brings up to $1.7 billion the amount of security assistance the U.S. has contributed to Ukraine since the Russian invasion Feb. 24. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that along with the U.S. allies and partners, ""for every Russian tank in Ukraine, we have provided or will soon provide 10 anti-tank systems. ... They have the tools that they need, they're gonna keep getting them, and we're gonna keep sustaining that.'' Blinken shared those thoughts with NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell during an interview in Brussels that aired Wednesday on MSNBC. The kind of firepower Blinken referenced has helped the Ukrainians stave off attacks on the capital city of Kyiv, forcing the Russians to retreat and regroup. But for all the pressure the U.S. and its allies are putting on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war -- by increasing sanctions, supporting the Ukrainians and calling out Russian atrocities -- there's a harsh reality staring at those yearning for peace: ""As much as we want to see this come to an end as soon as possible, to stop the death and destruction that's being wrought by Russia in Ukraine, there is also a very likely scenario by which this goes on for some time,'' Blinken said. How long? Blinken was responding to congressional testimony from Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said the length of the conflict will likely be ""measured in years.'' The Justice Department unsealed an indictment Wednesday against Russian oligarch Konstantinos Malofeyev for alleged sanction violations, the first such criminal charges brought by the U.S. since Russia's invasion. The Treasury Department previously identified Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to acquire and run media outlets across Europe, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a Justice briefing.  “We are also announcing the seizure of millions of dollars from an account at a U.S. financial institution, which the indictment alleges constitutes proceeds traceable to Malofeyev’s sanctions violations,"" Garland said. Garland also acknowledged for the first time that the Justice Department is assisting in the effort to examine possible war crimes in Ukraine. He said U.S. authorities recently met with counterparts in Europe to develop a plan to gather evidence. ""This department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" Garland said. ""We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theater, and residential apartment buildings,'' he said. ""The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The Justice Department sees what is happening in Ukraine."" – Kevin Johnson Russian forces have completely retreated from Kyiv and Chernihiv, moving into neighboring Belarus and Russia after facing fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces, a senior Defense official said Wednesday. The Ukrainians hit Russian forces as they retreated from Kyiv, the official said. Kyiv remains under threat, although it has not been hit by airstrikes in the last 24 hours, the official said. The threat of a ground invasion to Kyiv has dissipated for now, the official said. The Russian forces – up to 40,000 troops, or almost one-third of the force Russian President Vladimir Putin sent to invade Ukraine – are being resupplied, according to intelligence assessments the official described on condition of anonymity. It's unclear when the withdrawal of Russian troops from those cities was completed. The Russians appear to have seeded some of the ground left behind with mines. The Pentagon believes the troops will be sent back into fighting in eastern Ukraine, the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have clashed with Ukrainian troops since 2014. Days after Russian forces retreated from the Kyiv area, investigators and volunteers are beginning the long, grim work of chronicling what U.S. officials have described as a ""troubling campaign"" of brutality against civilians. Ukrainian officials say the bodies of more than 400 civilians were found in towns around Kyiv after Russian forces withdrew.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, April 7, as Russia's invasion continues. The mayor of the encircled Ukrainian city of Mariupol said more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed during the monthlong Russian siege. Vadym Boichenko said Wednesday that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, and have destroyed more than 90% of the southern port city’s infrastructure. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of the Nazi concentration camps. Russia-occupation forces turned our entire city into a death camp,"" Boichenko said, according to the Ukrainian news agency Interfax. ""This is the new Auschwitz and Majdanek."" Boichenko's estimates of the fatalities in Mariupol come on the same day the U.S. imposed sweeping new sanctions on Russia that include targeting Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters in response to atrocities in Ukraine that the White House has called war crimes. Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, two daughters of the Russian leader and his ex-wife Lyudmila Shkrebneva Putina, face full blocking sanctions that will cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they may hold in the U.S. The administration believes many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members. Sanctions also target Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's wife and daughter. The new wave of sanctions on Russian elites add to the 140 other oligarchs and Kremlin officials already hit with sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. ""We’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin,'' President Joe Biden said. USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM:Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel to receive updates straight to your phone. Latest developments ►The U.S. House overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday calling for a federal government report on evidence of war crimes committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The legislation calls for the U.S. president to submit to Congress a report on efforts to preserve evidence related to war crimes ►Ukrainian authorities say nearly 5,000 people were evacuated from combat areas in the south or eastern part of the country. Over 10 million people, about a quarter of Ukraine’s population, have been displaced by the war, and more than 4 million of them have fled the nation. ►A North Dakota farmer jailed in Ukraine since November has been moved from Kyiv to Lviv, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said. Kurt Groszhan, 50, is charged with plotting to assassinate Ukraine’s then-agriculture minister, Roman Leschenko. The two had gone into business together after Groszhan moved to Ukraine in 2017. ►Ukraine's military said it has retaken the settlements of Dobryanka, Novovoznesenske and Trudolyubivka in the Kherson region just north of Crimea. ►$100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles will be sent to Ukraine to meet an urgent need, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The ""transfer"" comes amid a shift of fighting to eastern Ukraine. ►Greece is expelling 12 Russian diplomats. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Western countries have expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats. President Joe Biden said new economic sanctions imposed Wednesday against Russia, including two adult daughters of President Vladimir Putin, “ratchet up the pain'' further on Russia following the discovery of atrocities committed by its troops. ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said, describing scenes of bodies left in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha including civilians executed with their hands tied behind their backs.  “Responsible nations have to come together to hold these preparators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation."" The Biden administration announced sanctions on 21 Kremlin officials and Russian elites in addition to two adult Putin daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, and the wife and daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Other measures include full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank, as well as a ban on U.S. investment in Russia. European allies took similar actions. ""Think about the incredible amounts of money these oligarchs have stolen,"" Biden said, adding that they won't be able to keep their ""$100 million yachts"" and luxury homes ""while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day."" – Joey Garrison As much of the world recoils upon seeing images of the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, Moscow is turning to a well-rehearsed, long-standing strategy: Deny culpability, blame the victim, crank up the propaganda machine. In detailed broadcasts to millions of viewers, correspondents and hosts of Russian state TV channels said Tuesday that some photo and video evidence of the ghastly killings in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were fake while others showed that Ukrainians were responsible for the horrors. Some reports claimed to have video showing fake Ukrainian corpses moving, supposed evidence the deaths were staged. Accounts from eyewitnesses and foreign journalists in Ukraine, along with satellite images, belie that notion. But the disinformation can be effective in sowing confusion among the audiences, especially those in Russia whose access to independent sources of information is limited. “This is simply what Russia does every time it recognizes that it has suffered a PR setback through committing atrocities,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow with the Russia and Eurasia program at the Chatham House think tank. “So the system works almost on autopilot.” As they put up a fierce resistance to the assaults from a much larger enemy, Ukrainian forces are far from defenseless. The additional $100 million President Joe Biden authorized this week for military aid brings up to $1.7 billion the amount of security assistance the U.S. has contributed to Ukraine since the Russian invasion Feb. 24. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that along with the U.S. allies and partners, ""for every Russian tank in Ukraine, we have provided or will soon provide 10 anti-tank systems. ... They have the tools that they need, they're gonna keep getting them, and we're gonna keep sustaining that.'' Blinken shared those thoughts with NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell during an interview in Brussels that aired Wednesday on MSNBC. The kind of firepower Blinken referenced has helped the Ukrainians stave off attacks on the capital city of Kyiv, forcing the Russians to retreat and regroup. But for all the pressure the U.S. and its allies are putting on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war -- by increasing sanctions, supporting the Ukrainians and calling out Russian atrocities -- there's a harsh reality staring at those yearning for peace: ""As much as we want to see this come to an end as soon as possible, to stop the death and destruction that's being wrought by Russia in Ukraine, there is also a very likely scenario by which this goes on for some time,'' Blinken said. How long? Blinken was responding to congressional testimony from Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said the length of the conflict will likely be ""measured in years.'' The Justice Department unsealed an indictment Wednesday against Russian oligarch Konstantinos Malofeyev for alleged sanction violations, the first such criminal charges brought by the U.S. since Russia's invasion. The Treasury Department previously identified Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to acquire and run media outlets across Europe, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a Justice briefing.  “We are also announcing the seizure of millions of dollars from an account at a U.S. financial institution, which the indictment alleges constitutes proceeds traceable to Malofeyev’s sanctions violations,"" Garland said. Garland also acknowledged for the first time that the Justice Department is assisting in the effort to examine possible war crimes in Ukraine. He said U.S. authorities recently met with counterparts in Europe to develop a plan to gather evidence. ""This department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" Garland said. ""We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theater, and residential apartment buildings,'' he said. ""The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The Justice Department sees what is happening in Ukraine."" – Kevin Johnson Russian forces have completely retreated from Kyiv and Chernihiv, moving into neighboring Belarus and Russia after facing fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces, a senior Defense official said Wednesday. The Ukrainians hit Russian forces as they retreated from Kyiv, the official said.

Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, daughters of Putin and his ex-wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva Putina, face sanctions that will cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they may hold in the USA. The new round of sanctions, which bans U.S. investment in Russia and hits Russia's largest bank and financial institution, follows disturbing reports and images of civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha near the capital of Kyiv. The moves continue Biden's strategy of steadily ramping up sanctions as Russia's war in Ukraine escalates.  ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said Wednesday, describing scenes of bodies left in the streets of Bucha, including civilians executed with their hands tied behind their heads.  “Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,"" Biden said during his address to labor union members in Washington gathered for the North America’s Building Trades Unions Legislative Conference. The sanctions were made in coordination with the Group of Seven nations and European Union allies, which were likely to take similar sanctions. U.S. authorities suspect many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members. Vorontsova leads state-funded programs focused on genetics research that are personally overseen by Putin, and Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russia defense industry. The sanctions also target the wife and daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The White House called the moves “the most severe financial sanctions” the United States can take on these entities. Biden banned the U.S. import of all Russian energy products last month.

Sberbank holds nearly one-third of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets, and Alfa Bank is Russia’s fourth-largest financial institution. Biden signed an executive order that will prohibit investment in Russia by U.S. citizens – regardless where they live – in a bid to further isolate Russia from the global economy. More than 600 multinational companies have removed business operations or investment out of Russia.  Biden said the investment ban will ensure ""new money can't come into Russia to replace what's left."" Other sanctions prohibit Russia from making debt payments with funds subject to U.S. jurisdiction, a move White House press secretary Jen Psaki said presents Putin with a difficult ""choice"" between draining Russia's limited funds or default.  Psaki said the sanctions are designed to make it more difficult for Putin to fund the war in Ukraine, ""and we're seeing the direct impacts of that already."" In coordination with the U.S. actions, the United Kingdom announced a full asset freeze against Sberbank and Credit Bank of Moscow, a ban on Russia investment and targeted investments on eight Russian oligarchs and Putin associates. The actions come amid revelations into atrocities committed against Ukrainian citizens. Vadym Boychenko, mayor of the encircled eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, said more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed during the monthlong Russian siege. He said Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, and destroyed more than 90% of the southern port city’s infrastructure. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of the Nazi concentration camps. Russia-occupation forces turned our entire city into a death camp,"" Boychenko said, according to the Ukrainian news agency Interfax. ""This is the new Auschwitz and Majdanek."" Biden touted the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Russia, pointing to projections that Russia’s gross domestic product will shrink by “double-digits” this year. He said sanctions “wiped out the last 15 years of Russia’s economic gains” and cut off the country from importing critical technology such as semiconductors. “We’re going to stifle Russia’s ability to grow its economy for years to come,” Biden said. The Justice Department took separate actions Wednesday aimed at a top Russian oligarch, unsealing an indictment against Konstantinos Malofeyev for alleged sanction violations. The Treasury Department identified Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, a separatist region in Ukraine.  “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a briefing. Garland announced the seizure of millions of dollars from an account at a U.S. financial institution, which the indictment alleges constitutes proceeds traceable to Malofeyev’s sanction violations. U.S. authorities disrupted a global botnet controlled by the Russian military intelligence agency – commonly known as the GRU – aimed at infecting Ukrainian networks, according to the Justice Department.  FBI Director Christopher Wray said the cyber disruption disabled Russia’s intended actions against “thousands of devices” before they could be launched. Wray said the action “strikes a blow against Russian intelligence.” In addition to the enforcement actions, Garland acknowledged for the first time that the Justice Department was assisting in the effort to examine possible war crimes in Ukraine. The attorney general said U.S. authorities met with counterparts in Europe to develop a plan to gather evidence. This week, Biden called for a war crimes trial against Putin. The International Criminal Court is one possible venue, but the White House said the United States would work with allies to decide the mechanism.

Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, daughters of Putin and his ex-wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva Putina, face sanctions that will cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they may hold in the USA. The new round of sanctions, which bans U.S. investment in Russia and hits Russia's largest bank and financial institution, follows disturbing reports and images of civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha near the capital of Kyiv. The moves continue Biden's strategy of steadily ramping up sanctions as Russia's war in Ukraine escalates.  ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said Wednesday, describing scenes of bodies left in the streets of Bucha, including civilians executed with their hands tied behind their heads.  “Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,"" Biden said during his address to labor union members in Washington gathered for the North America’s Building Trades Unions Legislative Conference. The sanctions were made in coordination with the Group of Seven nations and European Union allies, which were likely to take similar sanctions. U.S. authorities suspect many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members. Vorontsova leads state-funded programs focused on genetics research that are personally overseen by Putin, and Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russia defense industry. The sanctions also target the wife and daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 'The new Auschwitz': Mariupol mayor says more than 5,000 civilians have died in Russian siege. Live Ukraine updates. Twenty-one members of the Russian Security Council and other Putin associates have been sanctioned, in addition to the 140 oligarchs and Kremlin officials – including Putin and Lavrov – targeted since Russia invaded Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, former president and prime minister of Russia, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin are among the newly sanctioned elites. ""Think about the incredible amounts of money these oligarchs have stolen,"" Biden said, adding that they won't be able to keep their ""$100 million yachts"" and luxury homes ""while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day."" LIVE UPDATES:US sanctions target Putin's daughters; Russians retreat from Kyiv; Dutch seize 14 Russian yachts The Biden administration is imposing sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, 42 of its subsidiaries and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank, and six of its subsidiaries. The White House called the moves “the most severe financial sanctions” the United States can take on these entities. Biden banned the U.S. import of all Russian energy products last month. The actions will freeze any of Sberbank's and Alfa Bank's assets touching the U.S. financial system and prohibit Americans from doing business with either.

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., to Biden, requesting he give a ""prompt nomination"" of the next commandant of the military branch. The current commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, will retire on May 31, and the committee oversees and confirms all Coast Guard promotions. ""We believe that prompt action to nominate the next Commandant of the United States Coast Guard is imperative to national and economic security, as well as maintaining our commitment to the brave women and men who serve our nation as coasties,"" the letter read. On Tuesday, Biden announced the nomination of Fagan, saying in a Twitter post his administration is ""committed to seeing more qualified women at the highest levels of command and making sure women can succeed and thrive throughout their military careers."" Fagan is currently vice commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, and she has worked on all seven continents during her 36-year career with the branch, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. She is currently the longest-serving active duty Marine Safety Officer, giving her the title of the branch's first-ever Gold Ancient Trident. As second in command, her current duties include executing strategic intent and managing internal organizational governance, among others.

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., to Biden, requesting he give a ""prompt nomination"" of the next commandant of the military branch. The current commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, will retire on May 31, and the committee oversees and confirms all Coast Guard promotions. ""We believe that prompt action to nominate the next Commandant of the United States Coast Guard is imperative to national and economic security, as well as maintaining our commitment to the brave women and men who serve our nation as coasties,"" the letter read. On Tuesday, Biden announced the nomination of Fagan, saying in a Twitter post his administration is ""committed to seeing more qualified women at the highest levels of command and making sure women can succeed and thrive throughout their military careers."" Fagan is currently vice commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, and she has worked on all seven continents during her 36-year career with the branch, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. She is currently the longest-serving active duty Marine Safety Officer, giving her the title of the branch's first-ever Gold Ancient Trident. As second in command, her current duties include executing strategic intent and managing internal organizational governance, among others. Following Biden's announcement, Cantwell said in a statement that Fagan has shown strong leadership in her role and her nomination would ""inspire generations of American women to strive to serve at the highest level in the Armed Forces."" ""This nomination proves the value of enacting laws that provide family leave, childcare, and health care access to support talented women in the Coast Guard who have dual roles as service members and parents,"" she said.  Student loan pause: Biden extends pause on student loan payments until Aug. 31.

The Postal Service has remained fiscally underwater due to legislation passed decades ago limiting how it spends its money and what services it could offer. The USPS reform bill will give the agency that flexibility back. The bill easily passed Congress with rare bipartisan support, receiving a 79-19 vote in the Senate on Tuesday evening, after the House passed it last month in a 342-92 vote.  Here's all you need to know on the postal reform bill that is now law.  To understand the need for the Postal Service Reform Act, it's important to first understand why the U.S. Postal Service needs reform in the first place.  ""The Postal Service is deeply in debt,"" said James O'Rourke, a management professor at the University of Notre Dame. ""They have an $80 billion long-term debt arrangement, and their operating revenue is only about $18.5 billion a year. While that is a slight increase from last year and the year before, profit is now at very slim margins and over the past five years, they have lost money consistently."" The agency's financial woes can be traced back decades. When the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 became law, it required the postal service to serve all Americans while also breaking even.  ""It basically introduced an identity crisis that had very real consequences for USPS's operations ever since: is it a business or is it a service?"" said Porter McConnell, co-founder of the Save the Post Office Coalition. Bipartisan bill:From Ukraine to the mail, we're in a golden bipartisan era. Give thanks while it lasts. Decades later, in 2006, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act was passed, which required the USPS to put money aside for future retiree health benefits and restricted the services the agency could offer in the future to only the ones it already offered. The Postal Service was supposed to save $5 billion for the first 10 years of the program, which was on a 50-year schedule. But by 2012, it began defaulting on the payments. It said at the time that without defaulting, the agency wouldn't be able to pay its employees, suppliers or deliver the mail. Since the act's passage, the USPS has seen rising net losses in revenue for more than a decade. ""Whether intentional or no, both policies had the effect of draining the postal service's coffers almost immediately, and prompting calls for reform,"" McConnell said.  O'Rourke said that given the Postal Service's cost of business and current debt, the agency could ""go out of business"" within a year without further action. The reform legislation aims to address some of those problems. Under the law, the mandate that required the Postal Service to pay into future retiree health benefits will be dropped. Instead, retired postal employees will be required to enroll in Medicare.  In addition, the USPS must maintain a public dashboard tracking service performance and will report regularly on its ""operations and financial condition,"" according to a summary of the bill. It will also be able to create ""non-postal services"" in partnership with state and local government, like fishing licenses and subway passes, McConnell said.  More on the bill::Bill OK'd by House would ease Postal Service budget strains. Measure is backed by Louis DeJoy. The bill will save the Postal Service almost $50 billion over the next decade, according to Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  ""This bill, which has been 15 years in the making, will finally help the Postal Service overcome burdensome requirements that threaten their ability to provide reliable service to the American people,” Peters, a Democrat, said in a March 8 statement. Still, some say the bill doesn't go far enough. McConnell, who called the act ""a skinny bill by all measures,"" said some items the bill could have added include postal banking, funds to make postal trucks electric with public charging stations, census outreach and grocery delivery. ""This bill buys us time to have a conversation about the future of the post office,"" McConnell said. ""The urgent conversation we turn to now is what should the future of the post office look like?"" While people using the Postal Service might not immediately see a difference, over time the agency's financial stability will start to make a difference.  ""The vast majority of the budget shortfall at USPS can be attributed to the pre-funding mandate that the bill eliminates,"" McConnell said. ""Eliminating it removes the biggest excuse for the service cuts and price hikes that postal customers have experienced since Louis DeJoy became Postmaster General. We have seen that austerity logic leads to short-sighted decision-making, and that leads to slower, more expensive mail for all of us."" Regarding mail-in votes for future elections, O'Rourke said that, given no real evidence of widespread voter fraud via mail, voting by mail is more of a state legislative issue than a Postal Service one.  Fact check: How we know the 2020 election results were legitimate, not 'rigged' as Donald Trump claims ""I have full confidence the Postal Service can handle an election, could handle three or 4 million ballots,"" O'Rourke said. ""They proved they could do it the last time around. ""They deliver between 10 and 12 billion pieces (of mail) at Christmas,"" he added. ""Election is a day at the beach for those guys."""

""It will be a joyous day,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as he announced Thursday's vote Wednesday night. ""Joyous for the senate, joyous for the Supreme Court, joyous for America."" Three Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah – have said they will support Jackson, who would replace Justice Stephen Breyer when he retires this summer. Jackson, a 51-year-old federal appeals court judge, would be just the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman. She would join two other women, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, on the liberal side of a 6-3 conservative court. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast:  As NATO defense ministers gathered in Brussels Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on members of the organization to provide more weapons for Ukraine and not just defensive anti-tank and anti-craft arms. Stoltenberg said ""Ukraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn’t actually have any real meaning."" Also on Thursday, the U.S. Senate will take up legislation to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the United States' response to Russia's war against Ukraine. The United Nations General Assembly is voting Thursday on a U.S.-initiated resolution to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council over allegations that Russian soldiers killed civilians while retreating from the region around Ukraine's capital. U.S. officials have called the soldiers' actions a ""troubling campaign"" of brutality. More severe weather is expected Thursday, forecasters said, after tornadoes and storms swept through the South Tuesday and Wednesday. Forecasts show storms expected mainly in eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia and in central Florida throughout Thursday. Tuesday's tornado was among powerful storms that killed at least three people. Following Tuesday's storms, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency Wednesday, effectively freeing up state resources for storm recovery and response efforts.  Five-time winner Tiger Woods is one of 91 players scheduled to tee off Thursday morning for the opening round of the 2022 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia. The weeks leading up to the tournament have been focused on who will be on the course — and who won’t. Woods, who is a little less than 14 months removed from a devastating car crash that severely damaged his right leg and foot, said Tuesday that, ""I feel like I am going to play, as of right now."" He backed that up by playing the back nine at Augusta Wednesday. Woods' tee time Thursday is 10:34 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, three-time champion Phil Mickelson will not compete after he was embroiled in controversy for derogatory comments he made about the PGA tour, its commissioner and a rival league.  Veteran pitcher Kyle Hendricks is set to deliver the first pitch of the 2022 Major League Baseball season just past 2:20 p.m. ET Thursday as the Chicago Cubs host the Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field. Getting to Opening Day this year was more harrowing than most others as, after a 99-day lockout, MLB owners and the MLB players union came to an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement in mid-March. The prolonged negotiations caused spring training to be shortened and the first week of games to be rescheduled as doubleheaders or played on teams' mutual off days. Fans will notice significant changes right away as the National League will adopt the designated hitter for a full season for the first time ever. Seven games will be played Thursday, including the World Series champion Atlanta Braves raising a banner before hosting the Cincinnati Reds and Shohei Ohtani beginning his AL MVP defense by both pitching and hitting for the Los Angeles Angels against the Houston Astros.  Contributing: The Associated Press"

Three Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah – have said they will support Jackson, who would replace Justice Stephen Breyer when he retires this summer. Jackson, a 51-year-old federal appeals court judge, would be just the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman. She would join two other women, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, on the liberal side of a 6-3 conservative court. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast:  As NATO defense ministers gathered in Brussels Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on members of the organization to provide more weapons for Ukraine and not just defensive anti-tank and anti-craft arms. Stoltenberg said ""Ukraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn’t actually have any real meaning."" Also on Thursday, the U.S. Senate will take up legislation to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the United States' response to Russia's war against Ukraine. The United Nations General Assembly is voting Thursday on a U.S.-initiated resolution to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council over allegations that Russian soldiers killed civilians while retreating from the region around Ukraine's capital. U.S. officials have called the soldiers' actions a ""troubling campaign"" of brutality. More severe weather is expected Thursday, forecasters said, after tornadoes and storms swept through the South Tuesday and Wednesday. Forecasts show storms expected mainly in eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia and in central Florida throughout Thursday. Tuesday's tornado was among powerful storms that killed at least three people. Following Tuesday's storms, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency Wednesday, effectively freeing up state resources for storm recovery and response efforts.  Five-time winner Tiger Woods is one of 91 players scheduled to tee off Thursday morning for the opening round of the 2022 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia. The weeks leading up to the tournament have been focused on who will be on the course — and who won’t. Woods, who is a little less than 14 months removed from a devastating car crash that severely damaged his right leg and foot, said Tuesday that, ""I feel like I am going to play, as of right now."" He backed that up by playing the back nine at Augusta Wednesday. Woods' tee time Thursday is 10:34 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, three-time champion Phil Mickelson will not compete after he was embroiled in controversy for derogatory comments he made about the PGA tour, its commissioner and a rival league.  Veteran pitcher Kyle Hendricks is set to deliver the first pitch of the 2022 Major League Baseball season just past 2:20 p.m. ET Thursday as the Chicago Cubs host the Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field. Getting to Opening Day this year was more harrowing than most others as, after a 99-day lockout, MLB owners and the MLB players union came to an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement in mid-March. The prolonged negotiations caused spring training to be shortened and the first week of games to be rescheduled as doubleheaders or played on teams' mutual off days. Fans will notice significant changes right away as the National League will adopt the designated hitter for a full season for the first time ever. Seven games will be played Thursday, including the World Series champion Atlanta Braves raising a banner before hosting the Cincinnati Reds and Shohei Ohtani beginning his AL MVP defense by both pitching and hitting for the Los Angeles Angels against the Houston Astros.  Contributing: The Associated Press"

Latest developments ►Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning editor of Russia’s now-closed leading independent newspaper, said he was attacked Thursday on a train that departed from Moscow by an assailant who poured red paint over him, causing severe discomfort to his eyes. ►The Commerce Department issued temporary denial orders to prevent Russian airlines Aeroflot, Utair and Azur Air from receiving items from the U.S., including parts to service their aircraft.  ►Russians and Belarusians accepted into the 2022 Boston Marathon who live in either country will be banned from competing in the April 18 race, the Boston Athletic Association announced. ►Russia’s Defense Ministry said it struck fuel storage sites around the cities of Mykolaiv and Zaporozhe in the south of Ukraine and Kharkiv and Chuguev in the east overnight using cruise missiles fired from ships in the Black Sea. ►Russia said it made a debt payment in rubles this week, a move that may not be accepted by Russia’s foreign debt holders and could put the country on a path to a historic default. German intelligence authorities have intercepted Russian military radio traffic discussing atrocities to civilians in the Ukraine city of Bucha, multiple media outlets reported Thursday. Some of the intercepted radio traffic can apparently be directly linked to dead bodies photographed in the town of 30,000 northwest of Kyiv, the German media outlet Der Spiegel and others reported. Hundreds of bodies were found in Bucha and other Kyiv-area towns when Ukraine re-took them in recent days.  Russia has denied involvement, saying the scenes of carnage were either staged or carried out by Ukraine troops. Der Spiegel, citing sources familiar with the audio, said it reveals Russian troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were discussing their everyday lives. In one of the intercepted conversations, a soldier apparently told another about recently shooting a person on a bicycle. A photo of a dead body lying next to a bicycle has been shared around the world.  The Washington Post reported that, in two separate communications, Russian soldiers described how they question soldiers as well as civilians and then shoot them, according to an intelligence official familiar with the audio. As they departed Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, Russian forces left behind a path of terror after weeks of siege: crushed buildings, streets littered with destroyed cars and residents in desperate need of food and other aid. And yet, the Russians wound up retreating after facing fierce resistance on the battlefields. Now that Moscow is shifting its offensive toward the Donbas region in the east, what can be expected in Ukraine's industrial heartland?  Ukrainian and Western officials say the Russians plan to encircle tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops in Donbas by moving from Izyum, near Kharkiv in the north, and from besieged Mariupol in the south. The timing will depend on how quickly Russia can take the southern port city, which has been reduced to rubble after weeks of bombardment but has yet to fall to the invading forces. Russia also needs to replenish the troops that were pulled back from Kyiv and other areas in the north. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in an analysis that the Russian troops will likely try to advance from Izyum to capture the strategic city of Slovyansk and link up with other Russian forces in Donbas in what it said “will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine.” Capturing the Donbas, which includes the disputed territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, may allow Moscow to establish a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which is annexed in 2014. Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall shared his first update on social media since he was injured last month in Ukraine, and paid tribute to two colleagues who were killed in the attack. ""To sum it up, I've lost half a leg on one side and a foot on the other. One hand is being put together, one eye is no longer working, and my hearing is pretty blown, but all in all I feel pretty damn lucky to be here - and it is the people who got me here who are amazing!"" Hall said on Twitter with a photo of himself on a stretcher. Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova and Hall were traveling in a vehicle in Horenka, a village nearly 20 miles from Kyiv, when they were struck by incoming fire March 14. Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova were killed. Hall was evacuated days later. Hall said for Zakrzewski, ""working was his joy and his joy was infectious.""  -Jeanine Santucci The U.S. Senate voted 100-0 Thursday in favor of banning the importation of oil from Russia and ending normal trade relations with the country in response to the atrocities in Ukraine during the monthlong Russian siege. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of war crimes, echoing other U.S. and international officials, urging the Senate to pass the bills to hold the Kremlin accountable for his actions. ""Ending normal trade relations hammers home that Putin has made Russia into a full-fledged pariah state,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The trade suspension will allow the U.S. to enact higher tariffs on Russian imports, while the bill banning Russian oil will codify into law an executive order that President Joe Biden signed. Russian crude oil made up only 3% of the total imported by the U.S. in 2021, but petroleum products from Russia accounted for 20% of the amount imported, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Both the bills have been stuck in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who have called on the government to ramp up its response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some European countries are weighing whether to ban Russian oil imports, at a heavy economic cost: Russia produces about 40% of the natural gas the European Union uses to heat homes and generate electricity, among other necessities, and about 25% of the oil required to fuel its vehicles. European Union nations agreed Thursday to new sanctions on Russia that include a ban on importing its coal, but that measure won't go into effect until mid-August, a month later than initially proposed. Reuters reported that Germany, the EU's top importer of Russian coal, pushed for the delay.  Though the coal boycott represents the first time the EU sanctions Russia's lucrative energy industry -- upon which many European countries depend -- it falls short of delivering a powerful blow to President Vladimir Putin's government. The EU pays Russia $20 million a day for coal — compared to $850 million a day for oil and gas. There has been discussion but no current plans to ban either of those despite the horrifying evidence of Russian brutality in Ukraine that sparked a new round of sanctions. EU countries, especially big economies like Italy and Germany, rely heavily on Russian natural gas to heat and cool homes, generate electricity and keep industry churning. Though coal should be the easiest to replace of the energy sources supplied by Russia, the boycott comes with the likelihood of fueling already high inflation. The Pentagon on Thursday shared details of the U.S. aid to Ukraine, which includes $1.7 billion in security assistance since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion and $2.4 billion since the beginning of the Biden Administration. Among the items provided to Ukraine to help it fend off the Russian aggression: The number of Switchblade drones has increased markedly, likely an indication of their effectiveness against Russian armored vehicles. -- Tom Vanden Brook Ukraine issued urgent pleas for more weapons Thursday as the U.S. prepared to resurrect a World War II-era program making it easier to provide the embattled nation with desperately needed firepower to repel the Russian invasion. In Brussels, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba lobbied NATO for help: ""I came here today to discuss three most important things: weapons, weapons and weapons."" Congress was trying to resurrect the World War II-era program to facilitate funneling weapons to Ukraine. A bill unanimously approved by the Senate and awaiting House action would temporarily waive requirements related to President Joe Biden’s authority to lend or lease weapons or other supplies to Ukraine’s government. Former Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said the bill ""is not only inspiring, but it also marks a new stage in repelling the Russian aggressor."" President Joe Biden said new economic sanctions imposed Wednesday against Russia, including two adult daughters of President Vladimir Putin, “ratchet up the pain'' further on Russia following the discovery of atrocities committed by its troops. ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes,"" Biden said, describing scenes of bodies left in the streets of the Ukrainian town of Bucha including civilians executed with their hands tied behind their backs. “Responsible nations have to come together to hold these preparators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation."" The Biden administration announced sanctions on 21 Kremlin officials and Russian elites in addition to two adult Putin daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, and the wife and daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Other measures include full blocking sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, and Russia’s largest private bank, Alfa Bank, as well as a ban on U.S. investment in Russia. European allies took similar actions. – Joey Garrison Contributing: Associated Press"

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 7th of April 2022. Today's staggering new death toll numbers in Ukraine, plus no charges for the officer who killed Amir Locke and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ The mayor of Mariupol, Ukraine, said yesterday that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed there during Russia's invasion. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that 210 of those killed in the city were children. He added that a staggering 90% of Mariupol's infrastructure has been cut. Russian attacks on the city by the Sea of Azov in Ukraine's southeast have systematically cut it off from food and resources, and it appears Russia has repeatedly targeted civilian housing complexes with shelling. In recent days more civilians have been leaving their basements and other shelters where they've been hunkered down for weeks. British defense officials estimate about 160,000 of the city's pre-war population of 430,000 remain. People like this resident named Gennadiy who described recent violence there. Taylor Wilson translating for Gennadiy: ""Everybody dispersed. One man managed to run away to a hallway. Someone ran away to a bathroom. In general, everybody ran away to a basement. We have been in a basement for 20 days or more."" Russia has especially focused on Mariupol in order to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia has completed its pullout of some 24,000 troops from around the capital Kyiv and also Chernihiv in the country's north central region. They're next expected to start up a new, aggressive offensive in Ukraine's eastern, mostly Russian speaking Donbas region. Ukrainian authorities are urging people there to evacuate now before a new offensive. The scene Russia is leaving behind in Ukraine's north is only this week becoming clear. Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found around Kyiv and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, yesterday, accused Russia of interfering with an international investigation into possible war crimes by removing corpses and trying to hide other evidence. Many of Russia's accused war crimes appeared to have happened in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Police and city officials yesterday were inspecting the remains of those killed. Cemetery manager, Serhiy Matyuk. Taylor Wilson translating for Serhiy Matyuk: ""They were simply killing civilians. They were abusing and killing. How many have we collected? About 300. Many are still being buried in gardens and yards. I think it will take a while to know the exact number."" Since this is an audio medium, you can check out a comprehensive visual story at USATODAY.com of just what the destruction in some of these Ukrainian towns and cities looks like. We have a link in today's show description. Meanwhile, in response to alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the US has announced new sanctions on Russian banks and against Russian president Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. Associated Press reporter, Josh Boak, has more. Josh Boak: If you look at what happened, they're going to block Sberbank, which handles about a third of Russian transactions, from being able to do business with the rest of the world. They're also blocking Alfa Bank, which is Russia's largest private bank. This represents a new stage in the sanctions because these are the institutions used by Russians, not just the Russian elite. However, these penalties also apply to the Russian elite and more particularly their children. The Biden administration is going after the two adult daughters of Russian president, Vladimir Putin. This is a very interesting move forward because often Russian oligarchs use their children as a means of hiding assets from authorities. The ban on new investments in Russia is a key part of the new sanctions. However, it's almost a lagging indicator because more than 600 businesses have already said they're not going to do business in Russia. That's really important because you're going to deprive the Russian economy of the oxygen it needs from abroad to keep running. The EU is taking steps to ban coal, but the big question is whether or not oil and natural gas will also be banned. Because in the long term, even if they immediately need Russian energy, they know that that dependence could ultimately produce vulnerabilities. These are hard questions, but this is the nature of war in the economy right now. We tend to think about war merely through military tactics, but it is about resources. It is about technology. It is about supply lines and the ability to replenish them. When you talk to administration officials, they would say that these sanctions have been transmitted to Russia at a very quick pace through the markets. However, these sanctions are really going to start biting in five, maybe even six months, and that's when we should judge them. You can find daily updates on the war in Ukraine at USATODAY.com. Prosecutors have announced that they will not file charges against the Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Amir Locke during a no-knock raid in February. Officer Mark Hanneman shot Locke three times less than 10 seconds after a SWAT team entered the apartment where Locke was sleeping. A warning, the following clip is graphic. Police: Face forward! Police! ... Face forward! ... Down on the ground! In the video, Locke starts to rise while wrapped in a blanket on the couch and holding a gun with his finger off the trigger. Locke's family said he legally owned the gun to protect himself. The officer fired two shots at his chest and one in the wrist. The officer, Hanneman, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. He was hired in 2015 and had three complaints against him that were closed with no discipline. A fourth complaint against him from 2018 is still open. Officers from the Minneapolis Police Department were carrying out a search warrant as part of a Saint Paul homicide investigation, but Locke was not listed on the warrant and did not live in the apartment where he was killed. Locke's 17-year-old cousin and another teenager have been charged in the homicide investigation involved the shooting death of Otis Elder in January. As for Locke's death, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison made a joint statement yesterday. Michael Freeman: The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, Minnesota Attorney General's Office and an independent expert each separately and independently have arrived at the conclusion that charges cannot be brought in this case. This death is a tragedy and was not necessary, but we're honor-bound under our ethical rules only to charge cases in which there's sufficient admissible evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and we believe it's there. To charge a case like this would simply be wrong. Keith Ellison: Amir Locke's life mattered. At 22 years old, he was only starting out. One thing Amir was not, Amir was not a suspect. Our investigation found no evidence that he had any role in the homicide investigation that brought the police to his door at 6:48 on February 2nd. Amir was a victim. He never should have been called a suspect. But Locke's mom, Karen Wells, said the fight is just beginning. Karen Wells: Right now the Minneapolis police officer that executed my baby boy on 2/2/22, be prepared for this family because every time you take a step we're going to be right behind you. This is not over. You may have been found not guilty, but in the eyes of me, being the mother who I am, you are guilty. Continue to have your restless nights because I know you do. You were probably restless before they decided to not charge you today, but you're going to continue to be restless because the spirit of my baby is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. I am not disappointed. I am disgusted with the city of Minneapolis. My son was protecting himself thinking he had to protect himself from all the crime that is out of control, Mayor Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, that you can't control. So my son decided that if he's going to go back and forth and do Instacart and DoorDash, he needed to bear arms, the legal way. He listened to myself and his father. He did the right thing. But at the end of the day, the Second Amendment, it doesn't matter to him. He has too much melanin. Locke's family has called for a ban on no-knock warrants. That reopens a debate that followed the police killing of Breonna Taylor in 2020. The SWAT raid that killed Locke, who, like Taylor, was Black, was initially not going to be carried out as a no-knock, but the Minneapolis Police Department later insisted. Starting tomorrow, though, they will be prohibited from no-knock search warrants except under a handful of exceptions. Locke's death sparked multiple days of protests in the Twin Cities in February. The area previously became the epicenter of national protests against racial injustice after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. The Minneapolis Police Department survived a push to replace it with a Department of Public Safety last year but still faces a Justice Department investigation of its policies and practices. Students in the US whose last year's of high school were disrupted by the pandemic are struggling with math, in particular, the foundational college math courses they often need to succeed later in college and in life. Olivia Sanchez, a higher education reporter with The Hechinger Report, has more. Olivia Sanchez: College students who were juniors when the pandemic hit were in a unique spot because their high school was just a little bit more than halfway through, so virtually half of their high school was disrupted even if they had the opportunity to return to in-person learning in their senior year or in any capacity. While they were online, many students and professors say that the education they were receiving isn't comparable to what they would have received if they were in the classroom. That is due to just the completely different format, the attention that teachers could give to students, the attention that students actually had to give to their studies when there was so many other factors in their lives like financial struggles, health struggles with their family and loved ones to housing and food insecurity. I think that for a lot of students school fell lower on the priority list than it otherwise would have been if they were learning in person. Specifically with math which builds on itself as students move through their education, losing ground in that sort of vital time in their education is putting many students behind as they're entering college. I think that a lot of people I talk to for this story are pretty optimistic about what can be done to help students recover these losses. I do think that's because it's the only choice to be optimistic. This is a problem that a lot of people feel has to be addressed. Otherwise the stakes are pretty high on the personal level for students, on a community level, and for our country as a whole. So professors and educators are kind of scrambling to figure out how they can support their students, how they can help their students, again, recover those losses without lowering the standards so that the students are prepared to move on and succeed in the next courses and not just give them an A and shuffle the problem to the next professor.

I want to take a second today and fill you in on a great USA TODAY podcast celebrating our women of the year. This year's nominees have been champions of change around the country. You can hear from some of them in our Women of the Year podcast. It's hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Connie Schultz. Connie Schultz: They are titans of industry, sports, philanthropy, and so much more. They are vulnerable and energetic for their ambition. And they are far from finished. With success comes power, and these women carry as they climb. I'm Connie Schultz. Please join me for USA TODAY'S celebration of women, some you know. Simone Biles: Pushing mental health to the forefront was a huge thing. I honestly didn't realize in that moment the impact that it would have. And some you should know. Janet Murguía: I believe it's so important to encourage young people to try to move through this darkness and keep their sights set on a bigger dream. USA TODAY'S Women of the Year. Intimate portraits of outstanding women, available every Thursday in April wherever you get your podcasts. Happy Opening Day. America's national pastime, baseball, returns today, at least Major League Baseball does. The season begins after a delayed start because of negotiations between players and owners on a new collective bargaining agreement, and that agreement will change the game. The designated hitter will now be used in the National League not just in the American League, and the playoffs have been expanded. The season's delay also meant a shorter spring training preseason than usual. Plus, there's a new team name this year, the Cleveland Guardians. As for what'll happen on the diamond, the Atlanta Braves are trying to become the first team to repeat as champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000, but the Braves are not the odds-on favorites to win it all. That would be the Los Angeles Dodgers who did so in 2020. Opening day begins with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Cubs in Chicago with first pitch set for 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time on MLB Network. You can also watch the Cincinnati Reds take on the defending champion Braves at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on ESPN2. For coverage all season long, stay with USA TODAY Sports. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 7th of April 2022. Today's staggering new death toll numbers in Ukraine, plus no charges for the officer who killed Amir Locke and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ The mayor of Mariupol, Ukraine, said yesterday that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed there during Russia's invasion. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that 210 of those killed in the city were children. He added that a staggering 90% of Mariupol's infrastructure has been cut. Russian attacks on the city by the Sea of Azov in Ukraine's southeast have systematically cut it off from food and resources, and it appears Russia has repeatedly targeted civilian housing complexes with shelling. In recent days more civilians have been leaving their basements and other shelters where they've been hunkered down for weeks. British defense officials estimate about 160,000 of the city's pre-war population of 430,000 remain. People like this resident named Gennadiy who described recent violence there. Taylor Wilson translating for Gennadiy: ""Everybody dispersed. One man managed to run away to a hallway. Someone ran away to a bathroom. In general, everybody ran away to a basement. We have been in a basement for 20 days or more."" Russia has especially focused on Mariupol in order to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia has completed its pullout of some 24,000 troops from around the capital Kyiv and also Chernihiv in the country's north central region. They're next expected to start up a new, aggressive offensive in Ukraine's eastern, mostly Russian speaking Donbas region. Ukrainian authorities are urging people there to evacuate now before a new offensive. The scene Russia is leaving behind in Ukraine's north is only this week becoming clear. Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found around Kyiv and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, yesterday, accused Russia of interfering with an international investigation into possible war crimes by removing corpses and trying to hide other evidence. Many of Russia's accused war crimes appeared to have happened in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Police and city officials yesterday were inspecting the remains of those killed. Cemetery manager, Serhiy Matyuk. Taylor Wilson translating for Serhiy Matyuk: ""They were simply killing civilians. They were abusing and killing. How many have we collected? About 300. Many are still being buried in gardens and yards. I think it will take a while to know the exact number."" Since this is an audio medium, you can check out a comprehensive visual story at USATODAY.com of just what the destruction in some of these Ukrainian towns and cities looks like. We have a link in today's show description. Meanwhile, in response to alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the US has announced new sanctions on Russian banks and against Russian president Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. Associated Press reporter, Josh Boak, has more. Josh Boak: If you look at what happened, they're going to block Sberbank, which handles about a third of Russian transactions, from being able to do business with the rest of the world. They're also blocking Alfa Bank, which is Russia's largest private bank. This represents a new stage in the sanctions because these are the institutions used by Russians, not just the Russian elite. However, these penalties also apply to the Russian elite and more particularly their children. The Biden administration is going after the two adult daughters of Russian president, Vladimir Putin. This is a very interesting move forward because often Russian oligarchs use their children as a means of hiding assets from authorities. The ban on new investments in Russia is a key part of the new sanctions. However, it's almost a lagging indicator because more than 600 businesses have already said they're not going to do business in Russia. That's really important because you're going to deprive the Russian economy of the oxygen it needs from abroad to keep running. The EU is taking steps to ban coal, but the big question is whether or not oil and natural gas will also be banned. Because in the long term, even if they immediately need Russian energy, they know that that dependence could ultimately produce vulnerabilities. These are hard questions, but this is the nature of war in the economy right now. We tend to think about war merely through military tactics, but it is about resources. It is about technology. It is about supply lines and the ability to replenish them. When you talk to administration officials, they would say that these sanctions have been transmitted to Russia at a very quick pace through the markets. However, these sanctions are really going to start biting in five, maybe even six months, and that's when we should judge them. You can find daily updates on the war in Ukraine at USATODAY.com. Prosecutors have announced that they will not file charges against the Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Amir Locke during a no-knock raid in February. Officer Mark Hanneman shot Locke three times less than 10 seconds after a SWAT team entered the apartment where Locke was sleeping. A warning, the following clip is graphic. Police: Face forward! Police! ... Face forward! ... Down on the ground! In the video, Locke starts to rise while wrapped in a blanket on the couch and holding a gun with his finger off the trigger. Locke's family said he legally owned the gun to protect himself. The officer fired two shots at his chest and one in the wrist. The officer, Hanneman, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. He was hired in 2015 and had three complaints against him that were closed with no discipline. A fourth complaint against him from 2018 is still open. Officers from the Minneapolis Police Department were carrying out a search warrant as part of a Saint Paul homicide investigation, but Locke was not listed on the warrant and did not live in the apartment where he was killed. Locke's 17-year-old cousin and another teenager have been charged in the homicide investigation involved the shooting death of Otis Elder in January. As for Locke's death, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison made a joint statement yesterday. Michael Freeman: The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, Minnesota Attorney General's Office and an independent expert each separately and independently have arrived at the conclusion that charges cannot be brought in this case. This death is a tragedy and was not necessary, but we're honor-bound under our ethical rules only to charge cases in which there's sufficient admissible evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and we believe it's there. To charge a case like this would simply be wrong. Keith Ellison: Amir Locke's life mattered. At 22 years old, he was only starting out. One thing Amir was not, Amir was not a suspect. Our investigation found no evidence that he had any role in the homicide investigation that brought the police to his door at 6:48 on February 2nd. Amir was a victim. He never should have been called a suspect. But Locke's mom, Karen Wells, said the fight is just beginning. Karen Wells: Right now the Minneapolis police officer that executed my baby boy on 2/2/22, be prepared for this family because every time you take a step we're going to be right behind you. This is not over. You may have been found not guilty, but in the eyes of me, being the mother who I am, you are guilty. Continue to have your restless nights because I know you do. You were probably restless before they decided to not charge you today, but you're going to continue to be restless because the spirit of my baby is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. I am not disappointed. I am disgusted with the city of Minneapolis. My son was protecting himself thinking he had to protect himself from all the crime that is out of control, Mayor Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, that you can't control. So my son decided that if he's going to go back and forth and do Instacart and DoorDash, he needed to bear arms, the legal way. He listened to myself and his father. He did the right thing. But at the end of the day, the Second Amendment, it doesn't matter to him. He has too much melanin. Locke's family has called for a ban on no-knock warrants. That reopens a debate that followed the police killing of Breonna Taylor in 2020. The SWAT raid that killed Locke, who, like Taylor, was Black, was initially not going to be carried out as a no-knock, but the Minneapolis Police Department later insisted. Starting tomorrow, though, they will be prohibited from no-knock search warrants except under a handful of exceptions. Locke's death sparked multiple days of protests in the Twin Cities in February. The area previously became the epicenter of national protests against racial injustice after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. The Minneapolis Police Department survived a push to replace it with a Department of Public Safety last year but still faces a Justice Department investigation of its policies and practices. Students in the US whose last year's of high school were disrupted by the pandemic are struggling with math, in particular, the foundational college math courses they often need to succeed later in college and in life. Olivia Sanchez, a higher education reporter with The Hechinger Report, has more. Olivia Sanchez: College students who were juniors when the pandemic hit were in a unique spot because their high school was just a little bit more than halfway through, so virtually half of their high school was disrupted even if they had the opportunity to return to in-person learning in their senior year or in any capacity. While they were online, many students and professors say that the education they were receiving isn't comparable to what they would have received if they were in the classroom. That is due to just the completely different format, the attention that teachers could give to students, the attention that students actually had to give to their studies when there was so many other factors in their lives like financial struggles, health struggles with their family and loved ones to housing and food insecurity. I think that for a lot of students school fell lower on the priority list than it otherwise would have been if they were learning in person. Specifically with math which builds on itself as students move through their education, losing ground in that sort of vital time in their education is putting many students behind as they're entering college. I think that a lot of people I talk to for this story are pretty optimistic about what can be done to help students recover these losses. I do think that's because it's the only choice to be optimistic. This is a problem that a lot of people feel has to be addressed. Otherwise the stakes are pretty high on the personal level for students, on a community level, and for our country as a whole. So professors and educators are kind of scrambling to figure out how they can support their students, how they can help their students, again, recover those losses without lowering the standards so that the students are prepared to move on and succeed in the next courses and not just give them an A and shuffle the problem to the next professor.

I want to take a second today and fill you in on a great USA TODAY podcast celebrating our women of the year. This year's nominees have been champions of change around the country. You can hear from some of them in our Women of the Year podcast. It's hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Connie Schultz. Connie Schultz: They are titans of industry, sports, philanthropy, and so much more. They are vulnerable and energetic for their ambition. And they are far from finished. With success comes power, and these women carry as they climb. I'm Connie Schultz. Please join me for USA TODAY'S celebration of women, some you know. Simone Biles: Pushing mental health to the forefront was a huge thing. I honestly didn't realize in that moment the impact that it would have. And some you should know. Janet Murguía: I believe it's so important to encourage young people to try to move through this darkness and keep their sights set on a bigger dream. USA TODAY'S Women of the Year. Intimate portraits of outstanding women, available every Thursday in April wherever you get your podcasts. Happy Opening Day. America's national pastime, baseball, returns today, at least Major League Baseball does. The season begins after a delayed start because of negotiations between players and owners on a new collective bargaining agreement, and that agreement will change the game. The designated hitter will now be used in the National League not just in the American League, and the playoffs have been expanded. The season's delay also meant a shorter spring training preseason than usual. Plus, there's a new team name this year, the Cleveland Guardians. As for what'll happen on the diamond, the Atlanta Braves are trying to become the first team to repeat as champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000, but the Braves are not the odds-on favorites to win it all. That would be the Los Angeles Dodgers who did so in 2020. Opening day begins with the Milwaukee Brewers taking on the Cubs in Chicago with first pitch set for 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time on MLB Network. You can also watch the Cincinnati Reds take on the defending champion Braves at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on ESPN2. For coverage all season long, stay with USA TODAY Sports. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. We're here seven mornings a week on whatever your favorite podcast app is.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden's sister became the latest Washington figures to test positive for COVID-19, announcements that came Thursday after two cabinet officials and others tested positive the day before. Pelosi, who is asymptomatic, tested positive on Thursday. She will quarantine, her spokesman Drew Hammill announced. “The speaker is fully vaccinated and boosted, and is thankful for the robust protection the vaccine has provided,” Hammill said. Pelosi attended crowded events at the White House on Tuesday and Wednesday hosted by Biden. Pelosi is the eighth member of Congress to test positive this week. All of the members have been fully vaccinated and boosted. The president's test results: Biden tested negative for COVID on Wednesday, the most recent test the president has taken as part of his regular testing regime, according to the White House. It's Amy with today's top stories out of Washington. The Senate confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon, which will make her the 116th justice – and first Black woman – to serve on the nation's highest court. The Senate's historic vote was 53-47 with three Republicans – Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah – joining every member of the Democratic caucus in voting for her confirmation. President Joe Biden nominated Jackson in February, after Associate Justice Stephen Breyer announced he would retire at the end of the current court term. Though confirmed, Jackson will wait months to take her seat on the bench, until Breyer officially steps down. A historical addition: While Jackson's ascension will not change the ideological makeup of the court – where conservatives hold a 6-3 advantage – she will be the first federal public defender to sit on the high court. Of the 115 justices in the Supreme Court's 233 year history, 108 have been white men. Only five have been women, and three have been people of color. When Jackson takes her seat, it will mark the first time the court's nine-member bench will include two Black justices and four female justices.

General Assembly on Thursday approved a U.S.-initiated resolution to suspend Russia from the world organization’s Human Rights Council amid mounting evidence of atrocities by the Russian military in Ukraine. The vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield launched the campaign to suspend Russia from the 47-member Human Rights Council after videos and photos from the Kyiv-area town of Bucha emerged, revealing streets strewn with corpses of civilians after Russian soldiers retreated. Russia becomes the first permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to have its membership revoked from any U.N. body. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week also called for Russia's removal from the Security Council so it can't use its veto power to ""block decisions about its own aggression."" U.S. Senate takes additional action: The Senate voted unanimously Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and ban the importation of its oil, ratcheting up the U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid reports of atrocities. Two bills passed the Senate unanimously, 100-0. Both bills are expected to gain the House's support later Thursday before going to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The bill to end normal trade relations with Russia paves the way for Biden to enact higher tariffs on various imports, such as certain steel and aluminum products, further weakening the Russian economy under President Vladimir Putin. It also ensures Belarus receives less favorable tariff treatment.

He spoke about the high cost the Russian invasion is inflicting on Ukrainian people, the damage caused to hospitals, and the mental and physical impact the war is having on health workers and the civilian population. But tragically, Ukraine is not the only emergency the world is facing. In Afghanistan, people are selling their kidneys and even their children to survive. In Tigray, Ethiopia, one of the longest and worst blockades in history has largely shut off deliveries of food, fuel and medicines and the region is facing a humanitarian calamity, which includes mass starvation. A worsening climate crisis is leading to countries getting hit by multiple climatic catastrophes simultaneously. In the same week last month, Australia’s coral reefs bleached as other parts of the country dealt with ""cataclysmic floods."" A 'gay' dog got dumped at a shelter:I wish that were the most troubling LGBTQ news. And the pandemic persists with record cases and deaths being recorded in some Asian countries and intense transmission of omicron (variant BA.1 followed by BA.2) around the world continuing to put substantial pressure on health systems. Rising conflict, the worsening climate situation and prolonged pandemic collectively have led to the Doomsday Clock to become stuck at 100 seconds to midnight, which remains the closest the world has ever been to a civilization-ending apocalypse since its creation in 1947. It’s easy to feel despair but there are things we can do at the micro and macro levels to make a difference. To prevent the current multidimensional crises from turning into a humanity death spiral, there need to be concerted and creative efforts to bend the arc of history toward a solutions-orientated, healthier and sustainable world. The vast majority of the world wants to live in a world free of war, where they and their families can find good jobs, put food on the table, and have access to essential health services and high quality schooling. DeSantis is right:Thanks to ‘Woke’ Disney, my son won’t wear his Dalmatian-fur coat. While it is relatively easy to start a conflict, the search for peace is often elusive as wars have a habit of spiraling and leading to unforeseen consequences. Peace underpins all that is good in our societies. We need peace for health and likewise health for peace. For health workers, WHO staff and for our humanitarian partners on the ground, war makes everything exponentially harder and sometimes even impossible. Recognizing that peace is foundational to all our work on health, development and tackling the challenges of conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19, I am announcing a new Peace for Health and Health for Peace’ global initiative. It aims to foster new dialogue around health and peace. For example, the creation of humanitarian corridors so that people can access basics, including nutritious food, fuel and health services and that no health care facilities be targeted militarily, which is a disturbing new trend seen in conflict. I will ask other United Nations agencies, civil society, sport organizations, academia and business to get behind this initiative, which I hope will be part of an overall peace-building effort that helps people who are at highest risk of disease and death.  This has to stop:Marjorie Taylor Greene and others throw 'pedophile' around with ease The highly progressive Millennium Declaration – developed at the turn of the century –outlined the nexus between peace, security, development and health. War has relegated our struggles against a heating world and the COVID-19 pandemic onto something of the back burner, but both of these need international cooperation to move forward. And even in a highly divided world, progress is possible. For example, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union worked together to achieve smallpox eradication, which remains one of the great scientific achievements of our time and provides lessons for the other existential challenges of our time. While war currently dominates the attention of decision-makers and the media, the pandemic is by no means over. WHO recognizes the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and is working with countries to track the virus and ensure that all opportunities to boost the immunity of populations are taken. The goal of vaccinating 70% of the population is eminently doable, and I’m pleased to see countries including Vietnam, Pakistan and Nigeria reflect that progress is possible if resources and efforts are effectively targeted. Simultaneously, it is important to strengthen health systems, so countries can catch up on the many health issues that have seen progress backslide, while also preparing them for future variants of concerns and potential new pandemics. While rich countries are rolling out second boosters – fourth doses effectively – it is incompetent and or negligent that a few groups in those same countries are suggesting that vaccinating other countries to similar standards is not worth it. After all, the pandemic and the resulting challenges related to supply chain chaos, remain a threat to not just health but peace and security. Similarly, the climate crisis remains the largest, most complex existential challenge of our time. A heating world is bad for health, with 7 million people dying every year just in connection with air pollution. This week, WHO released updated air pollution guidance, which highlights that more than 110 countries are now monitoring the air their citizens breathe. It’s a good sign that countries are investing in this technology, but the amount of pollutants in the air reveals the need for a transformative move away from fossil fuels, which for humanity's survival must remain in the ground. With exponentially increasing fuel prices, leaders have a perfect opportunity to move rapidly toward renewable energy. There are lessons from the pandemic on how scientific innovation can save lives and protect health systems but only if everyone has access. This is pertinent for the climate space because it’s important to make plans now so that game-changing technology and know-how are shared effectively to help avert global calamity. Wars, the climate crisis and COVID-19 are all contributing to huge spikes in food and fuel prices, as well as inflation, which for many keep health out of reach. In the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel, famine is potentially on the horizon. As part of any peace initiative, it is critical that ensuring access to good quality and nutritious food is a basic requirement, alongside other basic amenities like health and education. Whatever the crisis, I’m proud that WHO is always on the frontlines fighting to save lives and work toward health for everyone, everywhere.  Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is the director-general of the World Health Organization. Follow him on Twitter @DrTedros."

For health workers, WHO staff and for our humanitarian partners on the ground, war makes everything exponentially harder and sometimes even impossible. Recognizing that peace is foundational to all our work on health, development and tackling the challenges of conflict, the climate crisis and COVID-19, I am announcing a new Peace for Health and Health for Peace’ global initiative. It aims to foster new dialogue around health and peace. For example, the creation of humanitarian corridors so that people can access basics, including nutritious food, fuel and health services and that no health care facilities be targeted militarily, which is a disturbing new trend seen in conflict. I will ask other United Nations agencies, civil society, sport organizations, academia and business to get behind this initiative, which I hope will be part of an overall peace-building effort that helps people who are at highest risk of disease and death.  This has to stop:Marjorie Taylor Greene and others throw 'pedophile' around with ease The highly progressive Millennium Declaration – developed at the turn of the century –outlined the nexus between peace, security, development and health. War has relegated our struggles against a heating world and the COVID-19 pandemic onto something of the back burner, but both of these need international cooperation to move forward. And even in a highly divided world, progress is possible. For example, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union worked together to achieve smallpox eradication, which remains one of the great scientific achievements of our time and provides lessons for the other existential challenges of our time. While war currently dominates the attention of decision-makers and the media, the pandemic is by no means over. WHO recognizes the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and is working with countries to track the virus and ensure that all opportunities to boost the immunity of populations are taken. The goal of vaccinating 70% of the population is eminently doable, and I’m pleased to see countries including Vietnam, Pakistan and Nigeria reflect that progress is possible if resources and efforts are effectively targeted. Simultaneously, it is important to strengthen health systems, so countries can catch up on the many health issues that have seen progress backslide, while also preparing them for future variants of concerns and potential new pandemics. While rich countries are rolling out second boosters – fourth doses effectively – it is incompetent and or negligent that a few groups in those same countries are suggesting that vaccinating other countries to similar standards is not worth it. After all, the pandemic and the resulting challenges related to supply chain chaos, remain a threat to not just health but peace and security. Similarly, the climate crisis remains the largest, most complex existential challenge of our time. A heating world is bad for health, with 7 million people dying every year just in connection with air pollution. This week, WHO released updated air pollution guidance, which highlights that more than 110 countries are now monitoring the air their citizens breathe. It’s a good sign that countries are investing in this technology, but the amount of pollutants in the air reveals the need for a transformative move away from fossil fuels, which for humanity's survival must remain in the ground. With exponentially increasing fuel prices, leaders have a perfect opportunity to move rapidly toward renewable energy. There are lessons from the pandemic on how scientific innovation can save lives and protect health systems but only if everyone has access. This is pertinent for the climate space because it’s important to make plans now so that game-changing technology and know-how are shared effectively to help avert global calamity. Wars, the climate crisis and COVID-19 are all contributing to huge spikes in food and fuel prices, as well as inflation, which for many keep health out of reach. In the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel, famine is potentially on the horizon. As part of any peace initiative, it is critical that ensuring access to good quality and nutritious food is a basic requirement, alongside other basic amenities like health and education. Whatever the crisis, I’m proud that WHO is always on the frontlines fighting to save lives and work toward health for everyone, everywhere.  Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is the director-general of the World Health Organization. Follow him on Twitter @DrTedros."

The Senate confirmed Jackson on Thursday, giving the White House and Democratic allies an opportunity to take a victory lap with the first Black woman headed to the Supreme Court. Jackson said she has spent the past decade writing hundreds of opinions on thousands of cases where she has done her “best to stay in my lane and to reach a result that is consistent with my understanding of the law and with the obligation to rule independently without fear or favor.” “I am humbled and honored to continue in this fashion as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, working with brilliant colleagues, supporting and defending the Constitution and steadfastly upholding the rule of law,” she continued. Jackson also took a moment to speak specifically to Black women, noting, ""It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. ""But we've made it. We've made it. All of us."" Before she addressed the crowd, the president hailed the historic nature and value of Jackson's confirmation. ""This is not only a sunny day, I mean this from the bottom my heart. This is going to let so much sun shine on so many young women, so many young Black women,"" Biden said. ""We're gonna look back – nothing to do with me – we're gonna look back and see this as a moment of real change in American history."" Harris kicked off the ceremony, saying Jackson will join a court that “will answer fundamental questions about who we are and what kind of country we live in.” “You will inspire generations of leaders,” said Harris, the first Black and woman vice president who presided over the Senate's vote confirming Jackson. “They will watch your confirmation hearings and read your decisions in the years to come.” ""Today is indeed a wonderful day."" The Senate voted 53-47 Thursday to confirm Jackson, a U.S. appeals court judge for the D.C. district. Three Republicans – Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah – joined all 50 Democratic senators to confirm the 116th justice. She will replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer.  More:Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed by Senate as first Black woman on Supreme Court As Biden struggles with low approval numbers, Jackson's confirmation marks a major victory for him and his party. The president has been dogged by high inflation, the ongoing pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine.  More:Jackson confirmed in a hurry. Getting on the Supreme Court? That'll take time. Biden vowed to nominate the nation's first African American Supreme Court justice during the 2020 presidential campaign, eventually choosing the 51-year-old Jackson over two other candidates he interviewed. He nominated Jackson on Feb. 25, setting off a quick seven-week confirmation process.  ""I could see it – a day of hope, a day of promise, a day of progress,"" Biden said of his long desire for a Black woman to be elevated to the nation's highest court.  While Republican members of the committee largely praised Jackson's character and demeanor, they seized on her sentencing in child pornography cases to accuser her of being soft on crime. They also pushed Jackson on hot political wedge issues such as gender identity and critical race theory. But with Collins, Romney and Murkowski bucking their party to support Biden's nominee, the White House was able to avoid a potential tie in the evenly divided Senate.  Biden said he knew whoever he nominated would be “put through a painful and difficult confirmation process.”  “But I have to tell you, what Judge Jackson was put through was well beyond that,” he said. “It was verbal abuse. The anger, the constant interruptions, the most vile, baseless assertions and accusations.”  Biden said despite the attacks, Jackson showcased “patience and restraint” and joy. “In the face of it all, Judge Jackson showed the incredible character and integrity she possesses."" The White House ceremony came amid a wave of positive COVID-19 cases among top Biden officials and other high-ranking Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Jamal Simmons, communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, also tested positive for COVID-19.  More:Speaker Nancy Pelosi tests positive for COVID-19 as outbreak spreads among government officials in DC The White House has said Biden was not in ""close contact"" according to CDC guidelines with any of the official including Pelosi, who interacted with Biden at White House events both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The White House did not take additional precautions such as testing, social distancing or masking requirements for the ceremony. Psaki pushed back at comparisons between Friday's event for Jackson and a 2020 White House celebration hosted by thenPresident Donald Trump for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which turned into a super-spreader gathering. ""At that point in time, vaccines were unavailable. People were not vaccinated,"" Psaki said. ""It certainly puts us in a different space."" Attendees included several cabinet members; among them, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Ten Senators were also in attendance, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill, who oversaw Jackson's confirmation as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They were joined by dozens of House members led by several members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorney Ben Crump also attended.  Guests sat in white fold-out chairs, eight rows deep, as an orchestra played to the side before the president’s arrival. Most in attendance were not wearing masks despite the wave of recent positive COVID-19 cases. Jackson might have to wait as long as three months before officially joining the nation's highest court. Breyer, who announced his retirement in January, has said he intends to finish the Supreme Court term, which will probably end in late June or early July. Jackson used much of her speech to thank those she said made her rise possible. They included her grandparents who did not get past grade school; her parents educated in segregated schools; her Harvard College roommates; mentors including Breyer; senators and White House aides; and her family. Jackson's husband, Patrick Jackson, beamed from the front row as they watched. Jackson also thanked her many admirers, especially children, who reached out to her with congratulatory letters since Biden nominated her. ""Our children are telling me that they see now, more than ever, that here in America anything is possible,"" Jackson said, adding that she's ""standing on the shoulders"" of so many Americans who did not have her opportunities but ""believed in the promise of America."" She called herself ""just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all."" ""No one does this on their own. The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion,"" she said, before quoting the poet Maya Angelou: ""I am the dream and hope of the slave.""

Biden's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, also tested positive for COVID-19.  More:Speaker Nancy Pelosi tests positive for COVID-19 as outbreak spreads among government officials in DC The White House has said Biden was not in ""close contact"" according to CDC guidelines with any of the official including Pelosi, who interacted with Biden at White House events both Tuesday and Wednesday.  The White House did not take additional precautions such as testing, social distancing or masking requirements for the ceremony. Psaki pushed back at comparisons between Friday's event for Jackson and a 2020 White House celebration hosted by thenPresident Donald Trump for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which turned into a super-spreader gathering. ""At that point in time, vaccines were unavailable. People were not vaccinated,"" Psaki said. ""It certainly puts us in a different space."" Attendees included several cabinet members; among them, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Ten Senators were also in attendance, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill, who oversaw Jackson's confirmation as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They were joined by dozens of House members led by several members of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights attorney Ben Crump also attended.  Guests sat in white fold-out chairs, eight rows deep, as an orchestra played to the side before the president’s arrival. Most in attendance were not wearing masks despite the wave of recent positive COVID-19 cases. Jackson might have to wait as long as three months before officially joining the nation's highest court. Breyer, who announced his retirement in January, has said he intends to finish the Supreme Court term, which will probably end in late June or early July. Jackson used much of her speech to thank those she said made her rise possible. They included her grandparents who did not get past grade school; her parents educated in segregated schools; her Harvard College roommates; mentors including Breyer; senators and White House aides; and her family. Jackson's husband, Patrick Jackson, beamed from the front row as they watched. Jackson also thanked her many admirers, especially children, who reached out to her with congratulatory letters since Biden nominated her. ""Our children are telling me that they see now, more than ever, that here in America anything is possible,"" Jackson said, adding that she's ""standing on the shoulders"" of so many Americans who did not have her opportunities but ""believed in the promise of America."" She called herself ""just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all."" ""No one does this on their own. The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion,"" she said, before quoting the poet Maya Angelou: ""I am the dream and hope of the slave.""

Iran is +400.  “Soccer is growing at a rapid pace in the U.S., and with fans who strictly follow the World Cup, we expect to see a 12% to 15% increase on soccer overall, with the majority of that getting placed on the tournament,” said Vincent Pepe, the soccer spokesman for Tipico Sportsbook, which unveiled its World Cup odds this week.   By now, Berhalter has already begun his homework on England. The group stage showdown is a mouthwatering Black Friday matchup Nov. 25. The Iranians, who qualified comfortably through the Asian region, also continue to grow in strength.  The narratives surrounding Group B could vary drastically depending on the European playoffs.  If Ukraine makes it through a pair of difficult road qualifiers against Scotland and then Wales in June, it would surely enjoy a swath of global sentimental support.  The current Russian invasion of Ukraine is the primary reason why those playoff games were delayed — with still no clear schedule in place.  The USMNT's first game in Qatar, Nov. 21, remains a mystery — even if Wales is considered by many to be the likeliest candidate to occupy the last spot.  Tipico and other gaming companies are waiting for the playoff results before offering a market to win Group B, rather than just advance.  “The uncertainty of the fourth team in Group B does affect the wagering on most U.S. markets due to the quality of teams that are in the playoff games,” Pepe said. If either Wales or Scotland advance, it would set up a local rivalry clash with the English — arousing plenty of deep sporting emotions.  “Both are quality teams with young, hungry players,"" Pepe said. ""On our end, it seems like people are holding off to place their bets until the final group is decided. England is the clear favorite to win this group, but second place will be a toss-up, as each team on their best day can compete with the others.”  Pepe predicts an influx of betting action will ultimately arrive, when the U.S. officially returns to the World Cup for the first time in eight years. The global anticipation will build toward the event — which was switched from its traditional summertime slot due to the Qatari heat — through most of the year.  With England favored (-161) to beat the Americans, the opening game against Wales, Scotland or Ukraine takes on paramount importance.  Berhalter’s squad evolved enough to not fear any international opponent. Many U.S. stars — like Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Weston McKennie (Juventus) and Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund) — face the highest level of club competition on a weekly basis.  Soccer has also grown dramatically in the U.S. since the national team last appeared in the World Cup, with Jurgen Klinsmann leading the team to a knockout stage exit in 2014.  A strong start could see the team’s progress become the preeminent sports story during Thanksgiving week — even amid the NFL and college football games.  ""We expect the money to start rolling in … (with) the majority (of bets) getting placed between the three-days-before to kickoff mark,"" Pepe said.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 8th of April 2022. Today, America's changing abortion landscape, plus new climate worries, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ The Guttmacher Institute is a reproductive health and rights think tank based in New York. It estimates that 26 states home to 36 million women of reproductive age are likely to ban abortion in some way, if the Supreme Court rules against the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Roe v. Wade in 1973, prohibited states from banning abortions before viability, meaning at around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. But until a possible overturn like that happens, states are starting to make their own laws on abortion, including most recently, Oklahoma. National Correspondent Bill Keveney chatted with Producer PJ Elliott about the law and its potential repercussions in other states. Bill Keveney: It's a near total ban on abortion. There's no time limit like six weeks or 15 weeks as in other states. You couldn't do it unless the mother's life was in danger, and they have a specific definition for that. And one of the big things is that the person providing the abortion, the doctor, could be subject to up to a 10-year prison term for it, which is a pretty heavy penalty compared to in some other states. PJ Elliott: So why are healthcare groups saying that this law is going to be the most cruel yet for women? I think it's because it doesn't even have any timeframe. The Texas ban, there's six weeks, which is about the time you get a fetal heartbeat. So, that gives you a little time. The Supreme Court is going to make a decision on a Mississippi bill that gives you about a 15-week window. All of these would either weaken, or if they're held up, be seen as weakening or perhaps even overturning Roe versus Wade, because that was based on viability, which a lot of people are saying is about 23 or 24 weeks for the baby. So, any shortening of that. So since there's only one very narrow exception, the people who pose it are saying that's the harshest ban. The sponsor of it in Oklahoma legislature called it the strongest legislation. They're kind of saying the same things from opposite perspectives. Is this something that's going to be sort of a domino effect that we could see in other states? Yes. And it's kind of a continuation of what's a domino effect when states are setting their own policies. When Texas instituted its ban in September, a lot of women were going to surrounding states and Oklahoma got 45% of the Texans going out of state for an abortion. So, that's almost half. What that's done is a wait time at an Oklahoma clinic, went from two to three days to at least two weeks. So people had to wait longer, which can make a pregnancy more complicated. And then some people in Oklahoma were going to states like Kansas, where they could get an abortion faster. And if the Oklahoma ban takes effect, if it's signed by the governor and it also has to go into effect in terms of there could be lawsuits against it, so that could hold it up. But if that went into effect, everybody from Texas, a bigger state in Oklahoma would then have to go to other states that are more receptive, like Colorado or New Mexico. So it does have a ripple or domino effect. You can find Bill's full story in today's episode description. Ukraine is warning that despite Russia's military pullback from Kyiv and other cities in the north, the country remains vulnerable. That was the message from Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba yesterday in Brussels. The scene in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha is increasingly horrifying. Its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said 320 civilians were confirmed dead as of yesterday, though officials expect that number to rise. The city was once home to 50,000 people. That number has now dwindled to just 4,000. The mayor also said that most victims died from gunshots, not from shelling. And some corpses were found with their hands tied. Investigators have previously said that some appeared to be shot at close range. The scene in the northern city of Chernihiv is one of mass destruction after Russian forces severely damaged infrastructure there. Viktiriia Veruha is a volunteer coordinating aid distribution. Viktiriia Veruha: It's good days for right now. At last, we can bring food. So it's still not safe place. It's still, we have no electricity, but right now we at last can bring some food, some medicine, and it's good news. And ever great people from Chernihiv, it's also very important, because we don't know what will be in future. Six weeks after invading, Russian forces have failed to oust Ukraine's central government, something Western countries said was Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial goal. Russia is now shifting its military attention to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which has already been hit by frequent Russian shelling in recent weeks. And shelling has continued in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. The United Nations estimates, the war has displaced some 6.5 million people within Ukraine and another four million have left the country as refugees. As for the possibility of peace anytime soon, the UN's Humanitarian Chief, Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths is in Kyiv this week. He told the AP yesterday that a ceasefire won't be easy. Martin Griffiths: No, it's difficult because this is a hot war. And the secretary general asked me to follow up possibilities of what he describes as humanitarian ceasefire for the whole country, ""To end the carnage,"" were his words. Obviously we all want that to happen, but as you know, you're here, that's not going to happen immediately. What I've been trying to do both in Moscow and here today in Kyiv is look at ways in which we can build from local ceasefires, build confidence, get corridors to work, where they need to, build humanitarian assistance. Well, I think it's not going to be easy because the two sides, as I know now from having been both in Moscow and Kyiv this week have very little trust in each other. What we're trying to do to overcome that - and we've been trying to do it, by the way, for a few weeks - is to get the two sides together. Optimism during peace talks last week has faded and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is accusing Ukraine of backtracking on proposals it made over Crimea and Ukraine's military status. Scientists say the world is dangerously close to tipping points of irreversible climate change. National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise has more on what's keeping climate scientists up at night. Elizabeth Weise: This UN panel that's been meeting for five years and writing this report, I mean, this report is so dense, oh my goodness. It starts with footnotes. It's serious science. What they're saying is we have a lot of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now and we have not stopped adding more. We're not increasing as fast as we used to, but we're still adding lots more greenhouse gases. And the reality is that if we don't stop now, like in the next couple of years, it's like you start an avalanche. And once an avalanche starts, it's really hard to stop. And they're saying there are certain earth systems that are close to this tipping point. One guy described it to me it's as if you had... You put a gold bar in one end of a scale, and then you started putting ounce, after ounce, after ounce in the other scale. And each time the temperature rises just a little bit, it doesn't really affect things, it doesn't really affect things, but a certain point, one of those ounces is the straw that breaks the camel's back. So there's five things that scientists are worried about because they're already seeing these things starting to teeter a bit. The first is that the Amazon rainforest could turn into a Savannah. We're seeing the rainforest die off in places. And with fires, it might not grow back as rainforests. It would grow back as a Savannah. It'd start to look like Africa that is a much less biologically rich and carbon sink, and it's much less biologically rich. And there's a reason we call the Amazon rainforest, the ones of the planet. We could lose the coral reefs because as the water warms, coral have a narrow band of temperature that they can survive in. If they start dying off, this is what you see, called coral bleaching. They account for a quarter of all marine species in the planet. If they die, those species don't have a place to live. The ice sheets melting. This is both the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets. There's concern that they are already becoming a little unstable. If they melt entirely or even partially, we'll start to see catastrophic sea level rises. We're already seeing sea levels rise a little bit. I mean, we're talking 11 feet, 23 feet, losing all the coastal cities in the world. The Atlantic circulation stops. This is hot water that comes up from the tropics. It runs along the north coast of Europe, gets up to the Arctic where it cools and it runs down the eastern US. And it goes in this big circle. It is crucial to keeping weather patterns. If we lose that, Europe gets much colder, we see much larger hurricanes, and it could really mess with fisheries that we depend upon. The Senate has confirmed, Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris: On this vote, the yeas are 53 and the nays are 47. And this nomination is confirmed. That's Vice-President Kamala Harris, who presided over the Senate for the vote. Jackson will be the 116th justice and the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation's highest court. The Senate's historic vote went 53 to 47. Every Democrat voted for her confirmation, but only three Republicans did so, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney. Jackson was nominated by President Joe Biden in February, but as we talked about earlier this week on 5 Things, she'll now have to wait months to take her seat on the bench until Associate Justice Stephen Breyer officially steps down. Jackson's confirmation will not change the ideological makeup of the court, where conservatives hold a six to three advantage. Though she will be the first federal public defender to sit on the High Court. And when she takes her seat, it'll be the first time the court's nine-member bench will include two Black justices and four female justices. Of the 115 justices in the Supreme Court's 233-year history, 108 have been white men. Only five have been women, and three have been people of color. President Joe Biden tweeted after the vote, calling it a historic moment, something echoed by White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki. Jen Psaki: The President's outreach continued at this stage, calling senators in both parties early about his choice. Out of the gate, he proved he had chosen someone in the tradition by immediately getting endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and Judge Thomas Griffith followed by a procession of leading conservative legal minds and additional law enforcement organizations. As we've talked about in here a bit, she began her prep work immediately starting the day after she was announced and promised to meet with anyone who wanted to and honored it, meeting with 97 senators over the course of her consultations. She further displayed her work ethic, extraordinary credentials and character when she testified for over 20 hours and answered the most QFRs of any SCOTUS nominee ever. Biden watched the results of the Senate vote with Jackson in the White House. He previously promised as a presidential candidate to nominate a Black woman to the High Court. During confirmation hearings, many Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee accused Jackson of being soft on crime, particularly pointing to what they said were two lenient sentences on child pornography cases. Ted Cruz: Every single case, 100% of them, when prosecutors came before you with child pornography cases, you sentenced the defenders to a substantially below, not just the guidelines, which are way higher, but what the prosecutor asked for on average of these cases, 47.2% less. That's Republican Senator Ted Cruz. He said yesterday, ""Based on her record, I believe she will prove to be the furthest left of any justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court."" But Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska senator who is one of three Republicans to support Jackson sees things differently. She said, ""The confirmation of Judge Jackson is one that will help to ensure that the face of the United States Supreme Court is more representative of the American people."" The first completely private trip to space is set to launch this morning. The mission to the International Space Station comes as part of a deal between NASA and Axiom Space. Axiom is a private company that's building its own space station to host more researchers and eventually space tourists. Three paying customers and one former NASA astronaut will take flight on the 10-day journey, but they're not the first private citizens to ever board the ISS. Since 2001, seven paying customers have visited the station, flying with Russians on Soyuz rockets. The so-called AX-1 Mission is also not the first space flight to be funded privately. That was the SpaceX Inspiration4 orbital journey that launched last year paid for by billionaire Jared Isaacman. But AX-1 is the first privately funded mission of private astronauts conducted under an agreement between NASA and its commercial partners. And it's seen as a potential first step toward building a commercial economy in space. Depending on the weather, launch is set for no earlier than 11:17 AM Eastern Time from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 8th of April 2022. Today, America's changing abortion landscape, plus new climate worries, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ The Guttmacher Institute is a reproductive health and rights think tank based in New York. It estimates that 26 states home to 36 million women of reproductive age are likely to ban abortion in some way, if the Supreme Court rules against the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Roe v. Wade in 1973, prohibited states from banning abortions before viability, meaning at around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. But until a possible overturn like that happens, states are starting to make their own laws on abortion, including most recently, Oklahoma. National Correspondent Bill Keveney chatted with Producer PJ Elliott about the law and its potential repercussions in other states. Bill Keveney: It's a near total ban on abortion. There's no time limit like six weeks or 15 weeks as in other states. You couldn't do it unless the mother's life was in danger, and they have a specific definition for that. And one of the big things is that the person providing the abortion, the doctor, could be subject to up to a 10-year prison term for it, which is a pretty heavy penalty compared to in some other states. PJ Elliott: So why are healthcare groups saying that this law is going to be the most cruel yet for women? I think it's because it doesn't even have any timeframe. The Texas ban, there's six weeks, which is about the time you get a fetal heartbeat. So, that gives you a little time. The Supreme Court is going to make a decision on a Mississippi bill that gives you about a 15-week window. All of these would either weaken, or if they're held up, be seen as weakening or perhaps even overturning Roe versus Wade, because that was based on viability, which a lot of people are saying is about 23 or 24 weeks for the baby. So, any shortening of that. So since there's only one very narrow exception, the people who pose it are saying that's the harshest ban. The sponsor of it in Oklahoma legislature called it the strongest legislation. They're kind of saying the same things from opposite perspectives. Is this something that's going to be sort of a domino effect that we could see in other states? Yes. And it's kind of a continuation of what's a domino effect when states are setting their own policies. When Texas instituted its ban in September, a lot of women were going to surrounding states and Oklahoma got 45% of the Texans going out of state for an abortion. So, that's almost half. What that's done is a wait time at an Oklahoma clinic, went from two to three days to at least two weeks. So people had to wait longer, which can make a pregnancy more complicated. And then some people in Oklahoma were going to states like Kansas, where they could get an abortion faster. And if the Oklahoma ban takes effect, if it's signed by the governor and it also has to go into effect in terms of there could be lawsuits against it, so that could hold it up. But if that went into effect, everybody from Texas, a bigger state in Oklahoma would then have to go to other states that are more receptive, like Colorado or New Mexico. So it does have a ripple or domino effect. You can find Bill's full story in today's episode description. Ukraine is warning that despite Russia's military pullback from Kyiv and other cities in the north, the country remains vulnerable. That was the message from Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba yesterday in Brussels. The scene in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha is increasingly horrifying. Its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said 320 civilians were confirmed dead as of yesterday, though officials expect that number to rise. The city was once home to 50,000 people. That number has now dwindled to just 4,000. The mayor also said that most victims died from gunshots, not from shelling. And some corpses were found with their hands tied. Investigators have previously said that some appeared to be shot at close range. The scene in the northern city of Chernihiv is one of mass destruction after Russian forces severely damaged infrastructure there. Viktiriia Veruha is a volunteer coordinating aid distribution. Viktiriia Veruha: It's good days for right now. At last, we can bring food. So it's still not safe place. It's still, we have no electricity, but right now we at last can bring some food, some medicine, and it's good news. And ever great people from Chernihiv, it's also very important, because we don't know what will be in future. Six weeks after invading, Russian forces have failed to oust Ukraine's central government, something Western countries said was Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial goal. Russia is now shifting its military attention to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which has already been hit by frequent Russian shelling in recent weeks. And shelling has continued in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. The United Nations estimates, the war has displaced some 6.5 million people within Ukraine and another four million have left the country as refugees. As for the possibility of peace anytime soon, the UN's Humanitarian Chief, Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths is in Kyiv this week. He told the AP yesterday that a ceasefire won't be easy. Martin Griffiths: No, it's difficult because this is a hot war. And the secretary general asked me to follow up possibilities of what he describes as humanitarian ceasefire for the whole country, ""To end the carnage,"" were his words. Obviously we all want that to happen, but as you know, you're here, that's not going to happen immediately. What I've been trying to do both in Moscow and here today in Kyiv is look at ways in which we can build from local ceasefires, build confidence, get corridors to work, where they need to, build humanitarian assistance. Well, I think it's not going to be easy because the two sides, as I know now from having been both in Moscow and Kyiv this week have very little trust in each other. What we're trying to do to overcome that - and we've been trying to do it, by the way, for a few weeks - is to get the two sides together. Optimism during peace talks last week has faded and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is accusing Ukraine of backtracking on proposals it made over Crimea and Ukraine's military status. Scientists say the world is dangerously close to tipping points of irreversible climate change. National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise has more on what's keeping climate scientists up at night. Elizabeth Weise: This UN panel that's been meeting for five years and writing this report, I mean, this report is so dense, oh my goodness. It starts with footnotes. It's serious science. What they're saying is we have a lot of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now and we have not stopped adding more. We're not increasing as fast as we used to, but we're still adding lots more greenhouse gases. And the reality is that if we don't stop now, like in the next couple of years, it's like you start an avalanche. And once an avalanche starts, it's really hard to stop. And they're saying there are certain earth systems that are close to this tipping point. One guy described it to me it's as if you had... You put a gold bar in one end of a scale, and then you started putting ounce, after ounce, after ounce in the other scale. And each time the temperature rises just a little bit, it doesn't really affect things, it doesn't really affect things, but a certain point, one of those ounces is the straw that breaks the camel's back. So there's five things that scientists are worried about because they're already seeing these things starting to teeter a bit. The first is that the Amazon rainforest could turn into a Savannah. We're seeing the rainforest die off in places. And with fires, it might not grow back as rainforests. It would grow back as a Savannah. It'd start to look like Africa that is a much less biologically rich and carbon sink, and it's much less biologically rich. And there's a reason we call the Amazon rainforest, the ones of the planet. We could lose the coral reefs because as the water warms, coral have a narrow band of temperature that they can survive in. If they start dying off, this is what you see, called coral bleaching. They account for a quarter of all marine species in the planet. If they die, those species don't have a place to live. The ice sheets melting. This is both the Antarctic and the Greenland ice sheets. There's concern that they are already becoming a little unstable. If they melt entirely or even partially, we'll start to see catastrophic sea level rises. We're already seeing sea levels rise a little bit. I mean, we're talking 11 feet, 23 feet, losing all the coastal cities in the world. The Atlantic circulation stops. This is hot water that comes up from the tropics. It runs along the north coast of Europe, gets up to the Arctic where it cools and it runs down the eastern US. And it goes in this big circle. It is crucial to keeping weather patterns. If we lose that, Europe gets much colder, we see much larger hurricanes, and it could really mess with fisheries that we depend upon. The Senate has confirmed, Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris: On this vote, the yeas are 53 and the nays are 47. And this nomination is confirmed. That's Vice-President Kamala Harris, who presided over the Senate for the vote. Jackson will be the 116th justice and the first Black woman ever to serve on the nation's highest court.

The confusion began with a tweet in which former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., appeared to quote Carlson on photos depicting the bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, Ukraine. "".@TuckerCarlson tonight: 'What if these bodies of tortured, dead civilians were staged?'"" the April 4 tweet reads. ""'What if they’re fake? What if the Ukrainian military killed them & then blamed Russia? I’m not saying any of this is true, I’m just asking the questions. Why can’t we ask these questions?'"" Walsh's tweet referred to graphic images published April 4 that show Bucha residents who had been shot at close range or allegedly otherwise executed. Satellite imagery and intercepted calls indicate the photos are real, but the Russian government claims the deaths were ""staged"" by Ukrainian forces and Western media after Russian troops left the city. Thousands of people – including MSNBC host Joy Reid, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. – shared the tweet as if it were a real quote. Walsh later clarified the tweet was a ""prediction"" of what Carlson would say on his show ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" and Lieu deleted his quote-tweet of the post.

USA TODAY reached out to Reid, Kinzinger, Lieu and Siskind for comment.

The confusion began with a tweet in which former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., appeared to quote Carlson on photos depicting the bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, Ukraine. "".@TuckerCarlson tonight: 'What if these bodies of tortured, dead civilians were staged?'"" the April 4 tweet reads. ""'What if they’re fake? What if the Ukrainian military killed them & then blamed Russia? I’m not saying any of this is true, I’m just asking the questions. Why can’t we ask these questions?'"" Walsh's tweet referred to graphic images published April 4 that show Bucha residents who had been shot at close range or allegedly otherwise executed. Satellite imagery and intercepted calls indicate the photos are real, but the Russian government claims the deaths were ""staged"" by Ukrainian forces and Western media after Russian troops left the city. Thousands of people – including MSNBC host Joy Reid, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. – shared the tweet as if it were a real quote. Walsh later clarified the tweet was a ""prediction"" of what Carlson would say on his show ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" and Lieu deleted his quote-tweet of the post. The tweet also appeared as a screenshot in hundreds of posts on other platforms, such as Facebook. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks ""Fox News and the Murdoch family have a responsibility here!"" Amy Siskind, a Democratic activist and podcast host, wrote in a Facebook post April 4. ""Tucker Carlson should not be allowed on air in a time of war to spread Russian propaganda!"" But Carlson has denied saying the quote in the tweet, and Walsh told USA TODAY it's made up. The claim also surfaced before Carlson would have had a chance to comment on the Bucha images. USA TODAY reached out to Reid, Kinzinger, Lieu and Siskind for comment.

USA TODAY has reached out to the user who posted the claim.  The newest planned release, if no new oil is added to the stockpile during the six-month period, will see U.S. oil reserves drop by about 32%.  The Department of Energy oversees the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is a supply of about 568 million barrels of oil stored in four underground caves across the Texas and Louisiana coasts. The highest level the supply has reached was 727 million barrels in 2009. The reserve was created in 1975 by President Gerald Ford through the signing of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.

Crude Oil Test Sales, to ""ensure the readiness of the Reserve and its personnel to carry out"" a drawdown, have accounted for some past releases.

Five children were among those killed, the regional governor of Donetsk said. About 4,000 civilians were inside and around the station when it was hit. Photos from the scene showed bodies covered in tarps, surrounded by blood. Remnants of a rocket with the words ""For the children"" painted on it in Russian were also seen in photos. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the strike another Russian war crime and said Ukraine expects a tough global response. Ukraine's railway operator said Saturday operations are halted at the Kramatorsk station, but civilian evacuations will continue through other stations. Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister, added Saturday that 10 humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuations will open in the eastern area of the nation. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast:  Former President Donald Trump will return to North Carolina Saturday for a rally in the town of Selma in rural Johnston County. Candidates Trump has endorsed competing in contested Republican primaries across the state are expected to speak at the event. They include Rep. Ted Budd, a little-known congressman running for a Senate seat who won a surprise endorsement from Trump, and Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who continues to have Trump's support even though he has faced backlash from members of his own party over various recent incendiary comments. Saturday's rally comes amid questions over whether Trump's influence is fading amid stumbles in other states. Last month, he withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks, who was struggling to gain traction in Alabama's Senate primary. Also, Trump's efforts to shape Georgia's race for governor has not been going according to plan as his candidate for the Republican primary, former Sen. David Perdue, is trailing incumbent Brian Kemp in at least one recent poll. The 86th Masters golf tournament continues with the third round on Saturday (3 p.m. ET, CBS) and wraps up with the final round Sunday (2 p.m. ET, CBS). Only the top 50 players, including ties, made the cut to play this weekend and on that list is five-time champion Tiger Woods, who is playing in his first professional golf tournament since he was involved in a devastating auto accident in February 2021. Woods shot a 2-over 74 in his second round Friday despite his worst start ever at Augusta National Golf Club. Currently tied for 19th at 1 over for the tournament, Woods is scheduled to tee off Saturday at 1 p.m. ET alongside fellow American Kevin Kisner. The leader going into the weekend is American Scottie Scheffler who shot a 5-under-par Friday and will begin the third round five strokes ahead of four golfers tied for second place. Hideki Matsuyama, the 2021 Masters winner, is among those at 3 under. Scheffler's five-shot advantage is tied for the largest lead in Masters history after 36 holes. Cruise ships will once again make port calls in Canada after two years starting Saturday. Holland America Line's Koningsdam ship will be the first ship to dock in Victoria, Canada, on Saturday in 905 days since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the cruise line said in a news release.  Rob Fleming, minister of transportation and infrastructure, said in a release that British Columbia celebrates the return of cruise ships and their passengers while the region works to rebuild its tourism economy. The ban, which applied to cruise ships with more than 100 passengers, first went into effect in March 2020 and had been set to run through Feb. 28.  The NBA season began on Oct. 19.

The No. 2 seed in the East is open among three teams (the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers) and the standings are so tight, there's a scenario where the 76ers fall to the fifth seed if they lose their remaining two games and the Toronto Raptors win their final two games. Teams are also jockeying for position for the play-in tournament that begins Tuesday and features the 7-10 seeds in both the Eastern and Western conferences fighting for two spots in the playoffs.     Contributing: The Associated Press"

It is the love that leads ultimately to community and shared flourishing. Think about how our conversations across political, racial and other divides would be transformed if they were grounded in love. We would assume the best about each other and not the worst. We would be mindful of our tribal instincts and tribal thinking and work hard to overcome them.

Where we have been wronged, our plea for justice would be grounded in love and hope rather than enmity and fear. We would seek and find the common ground on which to build a flourishing world. Love, in a word, would change everything and make everything possible. But is this sort of radical love possible? That is the question on which everything turns. As an answer, the shared wisdom and experience of the world’s great spiritual traditions should give us hope. Each, in its own way, has found love at the heart of reality, calling and empowering us to love in return. And each has developed spiritual paths and practices through which countless ordinary people just like us have become exemplars of love. The suggestion: if you are doubtful about the power of love to transform our common life, take a look at the Fetzer Institute’s recent ""Study of Spirituality in the United States"" and our ""Guide to Exploring Spirituality and Civic Life.""

Boston's victory also means the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks are the No. 3 seed in the East. Staying in the East, the Brooklyn Nets won their regular-season finale, claiming the No. 7 seed ahead of Atlanta Hawks. In the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz all won their final games, locking all three teams into the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 seeds in the West, and placing the Denver Nuggets in the sixth spot.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Tuesday, April 12, as Russia's invasion continues. Russia is resupplying and reinforcing its invasion force in eastern Ukraine with a long convoy of vehicles heading to the region, indicating a new phase of the war is likely to occur there, according to a senior Pentagon official. That phase is expected to be bloodier and more brutal than anything seen in the conflict so far, considering Russia deems the Donbas region in the east an essential prize and has chosen Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, known as the ""Butcher of Syria,'' as its new commander.    A new sign of what's to come might have emerged Monday, when the Pentagon said it's aware of social media reports indicating the Russians have detonated a chemical weapon in the besieged port city of Mariupol, though it did not confirm their accuracy.   The Russian convoy, exposed in commercial satellite imagery, stretches an estimated eight miles. It appears to contain vehicles to command and supply infantry units and possibly helicopters, said the official, who provided intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of an impending Russian offensive in his country's east and has urged civilians to flee the region. ""The occupiers have sent dozens of thousands of soldiers and colossal numbers of equipment to prepare new attacks,"" he warned in a speech to South Korean lawmakers translated by NBC News. Josep Borrell, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, issued a similar warning Monday. USA TODAY on Telegram: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel  VISUAL EXPLAINER: Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine Latest developments: ►France's Societe Generale became the first big Western bank to announce an end to its business activities in Russia. SocGen is also selling its entire stake in Rosbank -- a Russian banking sector heavyweight -- to a company linked to an oligarch, costing the French bank some 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion). ►President Joe Biden asked India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday not to accelerate the country's purchases of Russian oil as the U.S. and other nations try to cut off Moscow’s energy income following the invasion of Ukraine. India has maintained a neutral stance in the war and Modi made no public commitment. ►The United Nation's children’s agency says nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion, and the organization has verified that 142 children have been killed and 229 injured, though the numbers are likely much higher. ►Russia has lost 19,500 troops, 725 tanks,1,923 armored vehicles, 347 artillery systems, 154 aircraft; 137 helicopters and an overwhelming amount of other equipment since the war began, the Ukraine military estimated Monday. Russia has not provided numbers but says its troop losses have been ""significant."" ►Moscow has appointed a new war chief after a largely unsuccessful six weeks of battle in Ukraine. Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, known as the ""Butcher of Syria'' because of his brutal tactics in that country's civil war, had been in command in southern Ukraine, where the Russians had initial success in the invasion. Russian forces, however, continue to have problems with morale, leadership and supply, according to British and U.S. assessments. The Pentagon on Monday evening acknowledged social media reports of Russian forces detonating a chemical weapon in Mariupol but could not confirm whether they're accurate, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. ""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” Kirby said. Use of chemical weapons, banned by international treaty, would represent a serious escalation in the brutal siege of Mariupol. The southern port city has been in the Russians' crosshairs since early in the war and remains under a relentless assault, but has not yet been claimed by the invading forces. A Pentagon official said the Russians have positioned 60 battalion tactical groups in eastern and southern Ukraine – 48,000 to 60,000 troops – as they focus their efforts on that region. Some of them include troops involved in the failed attempt to seize the capital of Kyiv. -- Tom Vanden Brook Vadym Boychenko, mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol, says more than 10,000 civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion in February. Boychenko said corpses were “carpeted through the streets of our city” and the death toll could actually exceed 20,000. Russian forces bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on Sunday, isolating the city's remaining Ukrainian defenders in two locations, according to the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War. The city is crucial to Russia's effort to link Crimea with the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have established de facto republics that even Russia only recognized days before the war broke out in February. “I’m afraid the Russian troops are massing on the east to launch an attack on the Donbas,” said Josep Borrell, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. ""I am afraid ... the war will increase on the Donbas."" Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer did not come away optimistic that the war in Ukraine would end soon after what he described as “very direct, open and tough” talks Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which Nehammer called for the hostilities to stop. “It might be necessary to do it 100 times,” Nehammer said of the meeting. “But I think it’s necessary to do it, so that peace reigns again and the people of Ukraine can live safely.” Nehammer said he brought up the topic of war crimes committed by Russian troops during the first meeting between Putin and a European leader in Moscow since Russia invaded its neighbor Feb. 24. On Saturday, Nehammer had traveled to Kyiv for a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Nehammer said face-to-face talks to look “each other in the eye, discussing the horrors of war” could have an impact over the long term. The Russian military says it used sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles to destroy four S-300 air defense missile launchers near the city of Dnipro, just days after Slovakia sent Ukraine an S-300 air-defense system in a deal worked out by the U.S. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement Monday that Ukraine had received the technology from an unnamed European country and that about two dozen Ukrainian troops were also hit by the strike. “Our S-300 system has not been destroyed,” said Lubica Janikova, spokeswoman for Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger. It was unclear whether both sides are referring to the same airstrike as the Russians have targeted missile defense systems in three locations in recent days. Slovakia was able to provide a system to Ukraine because the U.S. was willing to give Slovakia a Patriot battery to replace it, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Russian forces have used phosphorous ""munitions"" in the Donetsk region in the past, raising the possibility they could be used in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies, the British Defense Ministry warned Monday. Phosphorus can ignite on contact with oxygen and severely burn human flesh, but it is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Russian shelling has continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainian forces have repelled several assaults and destroyed Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment, the ministry said in its latest assessment. “Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes while greatly increasing the risk of further civilian casualties,"" the assessment warned. A growing numbers of artists have fled Russia to neighboring Finland in recent weeks. Many faced the threat of persecution in Russia for not supporting official stances, and  their criticism of the war put them in danger of imprisonment. That compelled them to give up their work and make a new home several hours from the Russian border.  Now, amid a harsh crackdown on opposing views, many are unsure if or when it will ever be possible to return. Many artists said they were also worried about the integrity of their work in Russia, which has increasingly suppressed free speech and expression. “Theater is meant to talk to people and communicate with them, to explain things about the world,” Alena Starostina told USA TODAY. “But it looks like we failed. We couldn’t stop this war, and so I think we are also responsible for it.” – Tami Abdollah In his nightly address Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned his nation that the coming week would be as crucial as any in the war and accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes. “When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters,"" Zelenskyy said. ""And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this."" Zelenskyy called on Western countries, including Germany, to provide more assistance to Ukraine. During talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Zelenskyy said he discussed how to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Moscow to seek peace. “I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical,” Zelenskyy said. More Ukraine coverage from USA TODAY Ukraine could become part of the European Union in a matter of weeks, the president of the European Commission said Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Ukraine’s application to join the EU in February, and Olga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine, said she expects Ukraine to fully join the EU by June. The process can take years, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Ukraine’s membership could take only weeks to consider. “Yesterday somebody told me: 'You know, when our soldiers are dying, I want them to know that their children will be free be and be part of the European Union,' von der Leyen said. “They are in an extraordinary situation, where we have to take unusual steps.” – Celina Tebor Contributing: The Associated Press"

Today, Russia's offensive in Ukraine's east, plus the changing conversation around sex, and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  ♦ Russia is warning of a direct military confrontation with the United States. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov told Newsweek that the West is provoking Russia. And he added, ""We warn that such actions are dangerous. They can lead the US and the Russian Federation onto the path of direct military confrontation."" His comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into a seventh week. The Russian diplomat also told Newsweek that the invasion came because Ukraine would not stop what he called the genocide of Russians, and that the invasion has its roots eight years earlier when an uprising toppled a Ukrainian government with close ties to Moscow and put a pro-West administration in charge. He said that was particularly problematic because the government has sought closer ties with NATO and the European Union. Meanwhile, Russia's new offensive in Eastern Ukraine could be a decisive chapter in the conflict. Russia has given up most of its military positioning in Northern and Western parts of the country, but looks determined to take control of the mostly Russian speaking Donbas region in the east. Western military analysts though say Russia is focusing on a larger region stretching from Kharkiv in the north, Ukraine's second largest city, to Kherson in the south. Russian forces shelled Kharkiv yesterday and also continued their assault on Mariupol, the Southern coastal city that's seen some of the war's worst and most consistent violence. In Kharkiv, resident Natalia described how she narrowly survived an attack on her residential building. Taylor Wilson translating for Natalia: ""I got hit on the head and the shockwave threw me back. The stairs collapsed, the windows and doors were knocked out. Miraculously, I survived."" Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said yesterday in his nightly address that the coming week would be crucial in the war. He also accused Russia of trying to avoid responsibility for war crimes in Ukraine. Officials in Ukraine and around the west have accused Russia of war crimes for attacks on civilians. Zelenskyy said, ""When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. The day will come when they will have to admit everything except the truth."" A Texas district attorney will file a motion today to dismiss a murder charge against a woman who was arrested in the death of an individual by self-induced abortion. 26-year-old Lizelle Herrera was arrested last week, but it's not clear whether she was accused of having a self-induced abortion or whether she helped someone else get an abortion. The Sheriff's Office didn't say which law Herrera was charged under. In Starr County, District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez ruled that under Texas law, Herrera should not be prosecuted. The case comes in the same state where a bill last year banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Tiger Woods returned to the Masters this week. The golf legend's status at the tournament was up in the air until the week of, but he played and made the cut to compete into the weekend. After his comeback, Tiger also announced when we'll be seeing him again, at least once later this summer. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Golfweek's Adam Woodard about Tiger's future and how he performed this week at Augusta National. Adam Woodard: Look, a couple of years ago, when Tiger came back and won for the first time in the Masters in 2019, I kind of learned that you can't doubt this guy. He's always going to be able to have a trick up his sleeve. But then 14 months ago, he has that crash. We're not sure is he ever going to be able to walk again. And then let alone, he comes out here, plays four consecutive rounds, beats about five or six people, makes the cut. I mean, it's truly remarkable. Not enough can be said about what he's able to accomplish this week. He's not going to be happy about the result where he finished, but if anything, it's going to motivate him even more. And then today, he said he's going to play The Open Championship in July. He's going to try and play The PGA Championship in May. I mean, he's back and he's coming back, and he's only going to get better. And this week was a huge step forward for him. PJ Elliott: Did he talk about how he felt after four days of playing in the tournament without playing in one since the accident? Tired, exhausted. I mean, his body was broken down. I mean, you could tell he had a hitch in his giddy up the entire second nine when he was walking today. He was telling us the other day that it's going to be a lot of ice baths, a lot of recovery. I mean, and that's a guy who's already had multiple back surgeries. He's had a spinal fusion, let alone the fact that he's got a bunch of rods, screws, and plates holding his ankle and right leg together. And the fact that he was able to walk Augusta National, which is a very hilly terrain, a very hilly course, for four days and then even shoot under par the first day was just truly incredible. But I think when you kind of saw him struggling the last few days, that was all his body fatigue and not being able to clear a few shots. But I mean, if anything, this was a great test for what's to come later this year. For more, head to golfweek.com. The conversation around sex is changing, and there's a new trend on social media around the topic of vanilla sex shaming. Wellness Reporter Jenna Ryu has more. Jenna Ryu: Yeah. So vanilla sex shaming is a trend on TikTok, mostly among younger people, but it's basically ridiculing or mocking people who enjoy conventional sex. So, kind of devoid of kinks and fetishes. Obviously, shaming people of any sort is not acceptable, but experts have said that it's interesting that this trend of vanilla shaming is showing how people are kind of opening up about their views on what healthy sex looks like. So for example, talking about sex has usually been something that's uncomfortable or considered taboo. And when we do talk about it, the only kind of permissible form of sex we talk about is vanilla sex. So kind of seeing people rejecting that with vanilla shaming and instead embracing more unconventional methods like consensual BDSM, swinging with other couples, threesomes, role play, sex toys, et cetera, kind of shows how people are expanding their views on a once taboo topic. I think a lot of people try to avoid talking about sex, just one, because it can be an uncomfortable and private topic. But also because they assume that if you don't talk about sex, people just won't have sex which isn't true. And experts say that it doesn't stop people from having sex, it stops people from having safe sex. So for example, it doesn't give them the opportunity to openly talk about STD transmission, or for example, how to have of safe sex, pleasurable sex, knowing when you're comfortable, when you're not. So that's why it's important to kind of have these healthy conversations about sex that go beyond this one dimensional view we used to have of what is healthy and what isn't, because the reality is that sex is not a monolith and there's a lot of ways you can have healthy sex even if it's not conventional. You can find Jenna's full story in today's episode description. An update has arrived for some US passports. Beginning today, US citizens will be able to select the letter X as the gender marker on their passport application instead of M or F. The State Department announced the move last year and added that transgender travelers would no longer have to provide medical certification if their gender identity doesn't line up with the marker on their birth certificate or other documents. A human rights campaign said more than 1.2 million non-binary adults in the US, 2 million transgender people, and 5.5 million people born intersex could be affected by the changes.

Whil… [+4370 chars]","WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden announced Tuesday another step to try to reduce prices for drivers who have been paying more to fill up their tanks: expanding the availability of biofuels. Visiting an ethanol plant in Iowa, Biden  said the administration plans to allow E15 – gasoline that uses a 15% ethanol blend – to be sold during the summer . ""You’re going to be able to keep filling up with E15,"" Biden said in a large barn in front of an American flag flanked by tractors. ""It’s not going to solve all our problems. But it’s going to help some people."" E15 can cost 10 cents per gallon less on average at the 2,300 gas stations where it's sold, according to the White House. There are about 145,000 gas stations around the country. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS (the Oil Price Information Service), said allowing E15 to be sold this summer is a good political move by the administration that will help some people save money, even though vehicles using the blend get slightly less gas mileage. Overall, E15 is just a “bit player” in the fuel distribution system, Kloza said. The blend hasn’t caught on with the public, because drivers are often confused about whether E15 is a good choice for their car. “If I were looking at a toolbox, this is not a hammer. This is kind of a little tiny screwdriver or maybe a piece of emery board or whatever,” Kloza said of Biden’s attempt to increase fuel supplies. “But I understand the rationale for it.” Regular gas averages about $4.11 a gallon compared with $2.86 a year ago, according to AAA, and Biden is under political pressure to show he is doing what he can to ease the price pain at the pump. White House to oil companies:Stop sitting on record profits and lower gas prices Experts weigh in:Will gas prices ease with Biden's release from strategic reserve?  The Labor Department said Tuesday that consumer prices leaped 8.5% since last March, the fastest pace since December 1981. Inflation has notched 40-year highs for five straight months. Gasoline prices, which jumped 18.1% from March 2021 to March 2022, were the main reason for the inflation spike. Inflation is expected to “moderate"" by the end of the year, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters traveling with Biden to Iowa Tuesday. “But we are not going to wait for that,” she said, pointing to Biden’s announcement as an example of steps the administration is taking to help consumers. Biden said the United States would try to spur oil production and tap strategic reserves to ease gas prices, which spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting a ban on Russian oil imports. Video:Democrats accuse Big Oil of 'rip off' on gas prices Democrats labeled the increase ""Putin's price hike,"" though Republicans charge that Biden could do more to increase domestic oil production. Iowa's Republican Party greeted Biden with a billboard blaming him for high gas prices. ""Joe did that,"" the ad asserts.  Tom Seng, an energy expert at the University of Tulsa, called increasing the use of ethanol a short-term solution. It would raise the cost of corn and other grains used to make ethanol, he said. Administration officials said the action Biden announced Tuesday will increase the use of home-grown biofuels, reducing dependence on foreign fuels. Though almost all gasoline in the USA contains 10% ethanol, access to E15 is curtailed annually in some states from June 1 to Sept. 15 as a measure to limit smog during warmer weather. The Environmental Protection Agency determined that lifting that restriction is not likely to have a major environmental impact because most of the gas stations that sell E15 are not in areas with air quality issues, according to the White House.   The EPA is not likely to act until closer to June, when it will determine if a national fuel supply emergency still exists. The agency can grant waivers in 20-day increments.  What is the strategic petroleum reserve? Biden hopes it can bring down high gas prices Gas prices affecting vacation plans:Families prepare for 'costly' 2022 travel Under President Donald Trump, the EPA granted E15 a waiver for year-round use in 2019. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the rule, saying the agency exceeded its authority. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in January to hear a challenge to the ruling. Asked why Biden's actions won't run into the same problem, senior administration officials said – without going into detail – that Biden's approach is different. In addition to addressing energy prices, Biden's Iowa trip is part of the administration's spotlight on rural communities this month. Cabinet secretaries and other administration officials are traveling to dozens of communities to tout what Biden is doing for rural areas.  ""Investments are being made to reflect the value and importance of rural places and people,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, said Monday. Iowa is the nation's top producer of renewable fuel and the corn used to make it. Elected officials, Republicans and Democrats, from Iowa and other Corn Belt states, as well as farm groups and biofuel producers, pressed Biden to use his emergency powers to allow summer use of E15. A Harvard study last year said the use and production of ethanol emit up to 46% fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline. A University of Wisconsin study challenged that finding, saying ethanol is worse for the environment than gasoline, based on changes in how land is used to grow the corn used to produce it. The Argonne National Laboratory disagreed with the Wisconsin study last month, saying the group overestimated carbon loss from soil and double-counted some emissions, among other concerns.

This is kind of a little tiny screwdriver or maybe a piece of emery board or whatever,” Kloza said of Biden’s attempt to increase fuel supplies. “But I understand the rationale for it.” Regular gas averages about $4.11 a gallon compared with $2.86 a year ago, according to AAA, and Biden is under political pressure to show he is doing what he can to ease the price pain at the pump. White House to oil companies:Stop sitting on record profits and lower gas prices Experts weigh in:Will gas prices ease with Biden's release from strategic reserve?  The Labor Department said Tuesday that consumer prices leaped 8.5% since last March, the fastest pace since December 1981. Inflation has notched 40-year highs for five straight months. Gasoline prices, which jumped 18.1% from March 2021 to March 2022, were the main reason for the inflation spike. Inflation is expected to “moderate"" by the end of the year, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters traveling with Biden to Iowa Tuesday. “But we are not going to wait for that,” she said, pointing to Biden’s announcement as an example of steps the administration is taking to help consumers. Biden said the United States would try to spur oil production and tap strategic reserves to ease gas prices, which spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting a ban on Russian oil imports. Video:Democrats accuse Big Oil of 'rip off' on gas prices Democrats labeled the increase ""Putin's price hike,"" though Republicans charge that Biden could do more to increase domestic oil production. Iowa's Republican Party greeted Biden with a billboard blaming him for high gas prices. ""Joe did that,"" the ad asserts.  Tom Seng, an energy expert at the University of Tulsa, called increasing the use of ethanol a short-term solution. It would raise the cost of corn and other grains used to make ethanol, he said. Administration officials said the action Biden announced Tuesday will increase the use of home-grown biofuels, reducing dependence on foreign fuels. Though almost all gasoline in the USA contains 10% ethanol, access to E15 is curtailed annually in some states from June 1 to Sept. 15 as a measure to limit smog during warmer weather. The Environmental Protection Agency determined that lifting that restriction is not likely to have a major environmental impact because most of the gas stations that sell E15 are not in areas with air quality issues, according to the White House.   The EPA is not likely to act until closer to June, when it will determine if a national fuel supply emergency still exists. The agency can grant waivers in 20-day increments.  What is the strategic petroleum reserve? Biden hopes it can bring down high gas prices Gas prices affecting vacation plans:Families prepare for 'costly' 2022 travel Under President Donald Trump, the EPA granted E15 a waiver for year-round use in 2019. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the rule, saying the agency exceeded its authority. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in January to hear a challenge to the ruling. Asked why Biden's actions won't run into the same problem, senior administration officials said – without going into detail – that Biden's approach is different. In addition to addressing energy prices, Biden's Iowa trip is part of the administration's spotlight on rural communities this month. Cabinet secretaries and other administration officials are traveling to dozens of communities to tout what Biden is doing for rural areas.  ""Investments are being made to reflect the value and importance of rural places and people,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, said Monday. Iowa is the nation's top producer of renewable fuel and the corn used to make it. Elected officials, Republicans and Democrats, from Iowa and other Corn Belt states, as well as farm groups and biofuel producers, pressed Biden to use his emergency powers to allow summer use of E15. A Harvard study last year said the use and production of ethanol emit up to 46% fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline. A University of Wisconsin study challenged that finding, saying ethanol is worse for the environment than gasoline, based on changes in how land is used to grow the corn used to produce it. The Argonne National Laboratory disagreed with the Wisconsin study last month, saying the group overestimated carbon loss from soil and double-counted some emissions, among other concerns.

Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 12th of April 2022. Today, a glass half full look at fighting climate disaster. Plus the latest glance at inflation and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Last week's United Nations climate report painted a dark picture. If humanity does not act now to stop greenhouse gas emissions the planet could warm as much as three degrees celsius. National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise, told us on the show last week that at those temperatures major cities will be underwater, unprecedented heat waves will define summers, terrifying storms will become more frequent, and millions of plant and animal species will go extinct. But there is a sliver of hope. Elizabeth Weise: Yeah, so that climate change report is pretty depressing. I mean, you got to admit, they're basically saying if we don't act now we're going to reach three degrees celsius. And a lot of really bad things happen if the climate warms three degrees celsius, and we don't want those things to happen. And they happen within the lifetime of our grandkids, some of them. But as I was talking to the scientists and to the climate experts, they all, every single one of them, stopped and said something that really struck me, which is, we know we have the... If you ever watch The Six Million Dollar Man, ""We have the technology."" We know how to do this. Fifteen years ago, even a dozen years ago, we could not have shifted to wind power or solar power because it was too expensive. I mean, it was just ruinously expensive, but those prices, it is so cheap now. Wind power is down 72%. Solar is 90% cheaper than it was in 2009, so we could make this shift tomorrow. And that's what each of the scientists that I spoke with said. We can solve this problem, we're just choosing not to. It's not that any miracle of science has to happen. It's not that there has to be a technological breakthrough. At this point it's political. And as the Secretary General of the UN said, it's not even really political. It's that there are corporations and people who are making a lot of money off of the current situation and they are pushing hard to make sure that we don't change it as quickly as we need to. It's very clear that we're going to get there just because carbon neutral energy is cheaper now, but it's now this race, we have to get there quickly. We can't take all the time in the world. One thing I think people don't realize is how quickly this is already happening. Last year, in 2021, 13% of U.S. power generation came from solar and wind energy. And that's a remarkably large number considering that it was down near one a decade ago. And that's happening mostly because it's cheap. And if you want to produce cheap power, that's how you do it. The good news is it's already happening. We just need to speed it up a bit. And the other thing the researchers said is the more we do this, the better we'll get at it, and the cheaper it will get. One of the guys said if you think that solar and wind are cheap now, wait a decade. Wait til we've figured out how to do carbon capture and make it cheap and effective. I mean, America, we have the smartest best engineers and researchers in the world and when they really put their minds to these things, and they've got money behind them to start implementing stuff, things get cheap. And I mean, we can do these things. We have the capability. You can find a link to Elizabeth's climate reporting in today's episode description. The Mayor of Mariupol, Ukraine says Russian troops killed more than 10,000 civilians over the past six weeks as they've tried to capture the strategic port city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko again accused Russian forces of blocking humanitarian routes in and out of the city, and he gave new allegations of Russian forces bringing mobile cremation equipment there to dispose of victims' bodies. He said they've taken bodies to a shopping center where there are storage facilities and refrigerators. The issue of dead bodies lying around Ukrainian cities has become increasingly clear in the days since Russian forces pulled back from much of the country before their expected next push in Eastern Ukraine. They've left the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, but the nightmare there continues. Workers are exhuming bodies from a mass grave that was set up in a churchyard. Andriy Feoktistov was hoping to find his brother who was shot and killed. Taylor Wilson translating for Andriy Feoktistov: ""After he was killed he was left there for three days, then we brought him to the morgue. We had to put him outside because the morgue was full. And he stayed there outside until he was brought to the massive grave."" Many Western leaders have called the scenes in Bucha and other towns war crimes. And investigations continue into exactly how Russian military killed civilians there. Even though Russia has pulled back many of its ground forces over the past week to resupply, shelling from the air continues. A particularly brutal tactic that has often killed civilians and destroyed residential areas. Meanwhile, Russia appointed a seasoned general to lead its offensive on the Eastern Donbas region. And a senior U.S. defense official said yesterday that a large Russian convoy is moving toward the Eastern city of Izium, with artillery, aviation and infantry support. More artillery is also being deployed near the city of Donetsk. A Gallup poll out last month found that 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as LGBTQ. That's twice the percentage from 2012, just a decade ago when Gallup first measured identity. It's also jumped significantly from last year when the poll showed 5.6% of U.S. adults identify with LGBTQ. And as that number increases, exhibits and archives are showcasing the community's history. Reporter Cady Stanton has more. Cady Stanton: So for the article I talked to some organizers at some LGBTQ history and cultural museums in the United States. There's only a handful of them that focus on those specific topics, but they play a really pivotal role for the community because members of the LGBTQ community have faced historical erasure after decades of marginalization and discrimination. So as a result of that, these museums do a really good job of taking data about LGBTQ history that was historically relegated to just organizational and institutional documentation to create a fuller picture of what that history looks like. In particular, I focused on the upcoming opening of the American LGBTQ+ Museum in New York City. It's not set to open until 2024, but given the high rates of LGBTQ tourism in New York City it's meant to have a really large and wide audience, both for people who are members of the community and for allies. A lot of it focuses on historical events, such as the Stonewall Riots and the Stonewall Rebellion in New York City, but then also just decades and decades of activism, including items like posters and diaries. Given those decades of marginalization, the history looks a little bit different than it does for other communities, which have had their history written out and documented very clearly in textbooks. So it's a little bit nontraditional in how showcase that history, but it gives a really fuller picture of queer culture being able to use those other artifacts. So there's only one museum that is specific to LGBTQ history and culture in the United States, and that's in San Francisco, the GLBT Archives in San Francisco. But the New York City Museum, which is set to open in 2024 will also expand on that. And then there's also a lot of other museums that aren't so focused on public outreach, but are more archives, so for research. And there's one, the Stonewall Archives, in Florida, and then a couple of other archives in San Francisco. But something I learned researching the article that was very interesting was that a lot of these museums and archives are located in very well populated and urban areas so they haven't historically been incredibly accessible to people in more rural or non-urban areas. So as a result a lot of the archives are also becoming digitized and creating more opportunities to become accessible online and not just in the physical space in the cities. The Federal Labor Department will give an updated look at inflation today when the latest consumer price index is released. Last month's CPI report showed 7.9% inflation over the past 12 months, the highest one year increase in decades. And the index out today is expected to show that prices shot up 8.4% from 12 months earlier. That's according to economists surveyed by the data firm FactSet for an Associated Press report. Rising prices have been especially clear at the grocery store. A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report warned that all food prices are predicted to increase over the next few months. The NBA post season is here. The playoffs begin this weekend, but first it's time for the play-in tournament, which tips off tonight. The tournament involves a series of winner- take-all games featuring the teams seeded 7 through 10 in the Eastern and Western conferences. And up for grabs are the final two playoff spots in each. Tonight we'll see both battles of 7 and 8 seeds. First, the Brooklyn Nets host the Cleveland Cavaliers, followed by the Minnesota Timberwolves hosting the Los Angeles Clippers. Then tomorrow the 9 versus 10 games with the Atlanta Hawks hosting the Charlotte Hornets, before the San Antonio Spurs head to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans. The winners of tonight's games advance automatically to the playoffs, while the losers will play the winners of the 9-10 games. Those 9-10 teams will need to win their first match up in the second game to make it in. Once the playoffs get into full swing this weekend, a number of players are expected to return from injury to help their teams try to march to the NBA finals. USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt fills us in on their impact. Jeff Zillgitt: Steph Curry is the one guy I'm really looking at because if we go back, we just got done talking about the MVP race. Well, if we go back to the start of the season through November, early parts of December, Steph Curry was our MVP. I know we don't decide it after two months, but he was playing the best basketball in the league and I think he has the ability to transform that Warriors team just a little bit. I think Robert Williams of the Boston Celtics is another one. If the Celtics can advance to the point where he's able to return, he's so pivotal to what they do, mainly on the defense end. But when you talk about what he does offensively, he's a player you don't have to run a play for. He is a pick and roll guy. You can just throw the ball up for him. But defensively, when you look at what he does with Marcus smart, that sort of inside-outside defense, the Celtics to make that deep run and to continue being one of the best teams post Christmas, post All-Star break, in the league Robert Williams is going to be a key factor. You can watch tonight's games on TNT before tomorrow's action on ESPN. And stay with USA TODAY Sports throughout the playoffs for fresh coverage every day. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. A reminder, you can find us on Spotify, Apple podcasts, your smart speaker device, or wherever you find your audio. Thanks to PJ Elliott for his great work on the show, and I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY."

Taylor Wilson translating for Andriy Feoktistov: ""After he was killed he was left there for three days, then we brought him to the morgue. We had to put him outside because the morgue was full. And he stayed there outside until he was brought to the massive grave."" Many Western leaders have called the scenes in Bucha and other towns war crimes. And investigations continue into exactly how Russian military killed civilians there. Even though Russia has pulled back many of its ground forces over the past week to resupply, shelling from the air continues. A particularly brutal tactic that has often killed civilians and destroyed residential areas. Meanwhile, Russia appointed a seasoned general to lead its offensive on the Eastern Donbas region. And a senior U.S. defense official said yesterday that a large Russian convoy is moving toward the Eastern city of Izium, with artillery, aviation and infantry support. More artillery is also being deployed near the city of Donetsk. A Gallup poll out last month found that 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as LGBTQ. That's twice the percentage from 2012, just a decade ago when Gallup first measured identity. It's also jumped significantly from last year when the poll showed 5.6% of U.S. adults identify with LGBTQ. And as that number increases, exhibits and archives are showcasing the community's history. Reporter Cady Stanton has more. Cady Stanton: So for the article I talked to some organizers at some LGBTQ history and cultural museums in the United States. There's only a handful of them that focus on those specific topics, but they play a really pivotal role for the community because members of the LGBTQ community have faced historical erasure after decades of marginalization and discrimination. So as a result of that, these museums do a really good job of taking data about LGBTQ history that was historically relegated to just organizational and institutional documentation to create a fuller picture of what that history looks like. In particular, I focused on the upcoming opening of the American LGBTQ+ Museum in New York City. It's not set to open until 2024, but given the high rates of LGBTQ tourism in New York City it's meant to have a really large and wide audience, both for people who are members of the community and for allies. A lot of it focuses on historical events, such as the Stonewall Riots and the Stonewall Rebellion in New York City, but then also just decades and decades of activism, including items like posters and diaries. Given those decades of marginalization, the history looks a little bit different than it does for other communities, which have had their history written out and documented very clearly in textbooks. So it's a little bit nontraditional in how showcase that history, but it gives a really fuller picture of queer culture being able to use those other artifacts. So there's only one museum that is specific to LGBTQ history and culture in the United States, and that's in San Francisco, the GLBT Archives in San Francisco. But the New York City Museum, which is set to open in 2024 will also expand on that. And then there's also a lot of other museums that aren't so focused on public outreach, but are more archives, so for research. And there's one, the Stonewall Archives, in Florida, and then a couple of other archives in San Francisco. But something I learned researching the article that was very interesting was that a lot of these museums and archives are located in very well populated and urban areas so they haven't historically been incredibly accessible to people in more rural or non-urban areas. So as a result a lot of the archives are also becoming digitized and creating more opportunities to become accessible online and not just in the physical space in the cities. The Federal Labor Department will give an updated look at inflation today when the latest consumer price index is released. Last month's CPI report showed 7.9% inflation over the past 12 months, the highest one year increase in decades. And the index out today is expected to show that prices shot up 8.4% from 12 months earlier. That's according to economists surveyed by the data firm FactSet for an Associated Press report. Rising prices have been especially clear at the grocery store. A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report warned that all food prices are predicted to increase over the next few months. The NBA post season is here. The playoffs begin this weekend, but first it's time for the play-in tournament, which tips off tonight. The tournament involves a series of winner- take-all games featuring the teams seeded 7 through 10 in the Eastern and Western conferences. And up for grabs are the final two playoff spots in each. Tonight we'll see both battles of 7 and 8 seeds. First, the Brooklyn Nets host the Cleveland Cavaliers, followed by the Minnesota Timberwolves hosting the Los Angeles Clippers. Then tomorrow the 9 versus 10 games with the Atlanta Hawks hosting the Charlotte Hornets, before the San Antonio Spurs head to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans. The winners of tonight's games advance automatically to the playoffs, while the losers will play the winners of the 9-10 games. Those 9-10 teams will need to win their first match up in the second game to make it in. Once the playoffs get into full swing this weekend, a number of players are expected to return from injury to help their teams try to march to the NBA finals. USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt fills us in on their impact. Jeff Zillgitt: Steph Curry is the one guy I'm really looking at because if we go back, we just got done talking about the MVP race. Well, if we go back to the start of the season through November, early parts of December, Steph Curry was our MVP. I know we don't decide it after two months, but he was playing the best basketball in the league and I think he has the ability to transform that Warriors team just a little bit. I think Robert Williams of the Boston Celtics is another one. If the Celtics can advance to the point where he's able to return, he's so pivotal to what they do, mainly on the defense end. But when you talk about what he does offensively, he's a player you don't have to run a play for. He is a pick and roll guy. You can just throw the ball up for him. But defensively, when you look at what he does with Marcus smart, that sort of inside-outside defense, the Celtics to make that deep run and to continue being one of the best teams post Christmas, post All-Star break, in the league Robert Williams is going to be a key factor. You can watch tonight's games on TNT before tomorrow's action on ESPN. And stay with USA TODAY Sports throughout the playoffs for fresh coverage every day. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Inflation hit a fresh 40-year high as continuing surges in gasoline, food and rent costs more than offset moderating prices for used cars. The consumer price index leaped 8.5% annually, the fastest pace since December 1981, the Labor Department said Tuesday, likely cementing Federal Reserve plans for an unusually large half-point interest rate hike early next month. That increase is up from 7.9% in February, and inflation now has notched new 40-year highs for five straight months. Prices rose 1.2% from their February level, the sharpest monthly increase since September 2005. Easter egg prices:Egg prices are up for Easter and Passover because of bird flu and inflation. Here's how to save. Easter 2022 sales:The 62 best Easter 2022 sales on toys, treats and more—hop on these last-minute deals now Gasoline prices were the chief inflation culprit, jumping 18.3% and accounting for more than half the overall rise in costs.

Meanwhile, worker shortages in the U.S. are prompting companies to boost pay sharply to attract job candidates, leading them to lift prices to maintain profit margins. Excluding volatile food and energy items, so-called core prices rose 6.5% annually in March, the largest advance since August 1982. But on a monthly basis, core prices increased 0.3%, the slowest increase in six months and a sign such prices may be easing, Contingent Macro Research says.   Still, economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics says the report bolsters her view that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by a larger-than-normal half a percentage point at both its May and June meetings. She figures inflation won't peak until May. But Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics says further softening in core prices could cause the Fed to pull back to a quarter-point increase at the June gathering. In March, used-car prices offered some relief, falling 3.8%. But that still left costs 35.3% higher than a year earlier. But while prices for some goods are moderating, the cost of services is rising as the pandemic eases and consumers increasingly dine out, travel and do other activities. Airfares surged 10.7%, pushing the yearly rise to 23.6%. Hotel rates increased 3.3% monthly and 25.1% annually. Grocery prices increased 1.5% from the prior month and are up 10% over the past year. Ukraine accounts for about 8% of the world’s wheat exports, and war-related disruptions to shipments – or worries over such snags – appear to be pushing up the prices of wheat-related products, along with other commodities. Breakfast cereal prices rose 2.4% monthly and 9.2% from a year ago. Rice, pasta and cornmeal increased 2.8% monthly and 9.3% annually. And fresh biscuits, rolls and muffins rose 2.5% monthly and 10.8% from a year ago. And rent increased 0.4% from the prior month, and 4.4% annually. Both Wells Fargo and Barclays reckon inflation likely peaked in March. A fading pandemic should help ease supply snarls and labor shortages this year, economists have said. But don’t celebrate quite yet. “The descent in inflation is going to be painfully slow,” says Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard. And the war could extend the supply troubles and outsize price gains longer than expected, says Barclays economist Pooja Sriram.

Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks USA TODAY reached out to the user who posted the claim for comment. Though several organizations track data about human trafficking, there is no exact country-by-country index for child sex trafficking in particular, according to Kristen Leanderson Abrams, senior director of combatting human trafficking at the McCain Institute. A 2015 report by the International Labour Organization stated that in 2002, an estimated 6 million children were enslaved worldwide, with 1.2 million trafficked and 1.8 million sexually exploited. In 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people were victims of modern slavery, with women and girls accounting for an estimated 99% of the victims of illegal sexual exploitation. ""Modern slavery"" and ""human trafficking"" are both used as umbrella terms to describe forced labor and sex trafficking, according to the U.S. Department of State.  Fact check: COVID-19 vaccination not required for Ukraine’s emergency wartime payment Abrams noted that, for human trafficking in general, the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report is the ""gold standard.""  The report divides countries into four categories depending on each country's efforts to fight human trafficking, using criteria from the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Tier 1 indicates that a country fully complies with the minimum standards of the protection act, while Tier 2 means that while a country is not fully compliant, it is making ""significant efforts"" to reach full compliance. Tier 3 indicates that a country's government does not comply with standards and is not making efforts to do so.  The most recent report, from 2021, places Ukraine in Tier 2, along with countries such as Denmark, Germany and Japan. The United States is a Tier 1 country, alongside places like the United Kingdom and Canada. In contrast, Russia, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan are all classified as Tier 3.  Abrams also pointed out work by anti-trafficking advocacy groups Walk Free, the International Labour Organization and the International Organization for Migration. While the groups create multiple reports on modern slavery, their Global Slavery Index looks at modern slavery data on a country-by-country basis. In the most recent index report from 2018, governments are rated on a scale from A to D, with intermediate rankings like BBB and CCC, depending on their response to modern slavery within their borders. The Netherlands is the only country with an ""A"" rating, while the U.S. scored the next highest ""BBB"" rating. Ukraine is classified as ""BB"", while countries such as North Korea and Libya scored a ""D.""  The numbers change slightly in other parts of the report. In the section that breaks down modern slavery in Europe and Central Asia, Ukraine ranks #7 out of 50 countries in modern slavery prevalence, with 6.4 victims per 1,000 people. But no matter the metric used, Ukraine doesn't rank No. 1. The Russian invasion may serve to worsen child trafficking in the region, according to a March 19 UNICEF release. Traffickers have been known to take advantage of chaos and large-scale population movement, and UNICEF also called attention to the significant number of unaccompanied children fleeing Ukraine. While various indices exist for human trafficking, ranking countries by prevalence of money laundering is a much trickier endeavor. But there's no evidence Ukraine plays a leading role. The Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index is an annual ranking of money laundering and terrorist funding risk on a country-by-country basis. Run by the Swiss-based independent Basel Institute on Governance, the Basel AML Index uses data taken from places such as the World Bank and World Economic Forum.  Ukraine falls in the middle of the rankings with a score of 5.21, whereas Haiti takes the riskiest spot at 8.49 and Andorra takes the safest spot at 2.79. (The U.S. has a score of 4.60.)  Fact check: Footage of Slovak politicians pouring water on Ukrainian flag lacks context Still, there is no way to determine the ""money laundering capital of the world,"" because money laundering is a risk across the global financial system, according to Lakshmi Kumar, policy director at Global Financial Integrity, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.  No country is free of money laundering, Kumar said, and depending on several factors – size of the economy, strength of the judicial system, type of government – the risk of money laundering can rise or fall dramatically. At the moment, she said, the top-ranked Haiti is ""politically chaotic,"" which heightens the risk of money laundering. But the size of Haiti's economy casts doubt on the importance of a country's index ranking.  For example, the U.S. has a much bigger impact on the global financial system due to the size of its economy, so money laundering in the U.S. ""means more,"" Kumar said. Kumar also explained how money laundering between countries also complicates analysis.  ""Most of the world's illicit money leaves the developing world, but it finds a place in the developed world,"" Kumar said. ""If you isolated and just see this as a problem of Ukraine or Russia, then you ignore the role that US, Europe, the UK, Canada, all play in helping hide this money.""  In the end, Kumar said, looking at the cross-border nature of money laundering is crucial to studying the activity.  Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that Ukraine is the money laundering and child sex trafficking ""capital of the world."" There's no evidence Ukraine is uniquely problematic in either category. While the actual ""capitals of the world"" on these issues are difficult to pinpoint, various reports, indices and experts indicate that while trafficking and money laundering do occur within Ukraine's borders these problems are more prevalent in many other countries.

In total, food prices at grocery stores and supermarkets are expected to increase 3%-4% this year after already seeing a 6.8% jump from January 2021. Restaurant purchases are also 8.6% higher than in February 2021 and are expected to jump by 5.5%-6.5%. The USDA noted the increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are key factors in the pressure on food prices.  ""The situations will be closely monitored to assess the net impacts of these concurrent events on food prices as they unfold,"" the report reads.  As the cost of a trip to the grocery store rises, shoppers can expect every food category to cost more, with prices for 11 disaggregate food categories jumping at least 1% since last month.  Here are some of the food prices expected to drastically jump later this year: Inflation: Inflation rose at fastest pace in 40 years in March as consumer prices jumped 8.5% Food prices: Get ready to spend more at the grocery store. Food prices expected to soar, USDA predicts. From rotisserie chicken to raw breasts and thighs, poultry items are expected to see the highest jump in prices, with an estimated increase from 6%-7%. Wholesale poultry products are also predicted to see a 9%-12% price increase this year.  The USDA says the biggest factor in the jump is the outbreak of the bird flu, which has been detected in 23 states and resulted in tens of thousands of avian species being euthanized.  The bird flu is also a factor in the cost of eggs, with a predicted price increase of 2.5%-3.5%.  Here's how to save: Egg prices are up for Easter and Passover because of bird flu and inflation.

In total, food prices at grocery stores and supermarkets are expected to increase 3%-4% this year after already seeing a 6.8% jump from January 2021. Restaurant purchases are also 8.6% higher than in February 2021 and are expected to jump by 5.5%-6.5%. The USDA noted the increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are key factors in the pressure on food prices.  ""The situations will be closely monitored to assess the net impacts of these concurrent events on food prices as they unfold,"" the report reads.  As the cost of a trip to the grocery store rises, shoppers can expect every food category to cost more, with prices for 11 disaggregate food categories jumping at least 1% since last month.  Here are some of the food prices expected to drastically jump later this year: Inflation: Inflation rose at fastest pace in 40 years in March as consumer prices jumped 8.5% Food prices: Get ready to spend more at the grocery store. Food prices expected to soar, USDA predicts. From rotisserie chicken to raw breasts and thighs, poultry items are expected to see the highest jump in prices, with an estimated increase from 6%-7%. Wholesale poultry products are also predicted to see a 9%-12% price increase this year.  The USDA says the biggest factor in the jump is the outbreak of the bird flu, which has been detected in 23 states and resulted in tens of thousands of avian species being euthanized.  The bird flu is also a factor in the cost of eggs, with a predicted price increase of 2.5%-3.5%.  Here's how to save: Egg prices are up for Easter and Passover because of bird flu and inflation. Like poultry, fats and oil products are also expected to see a 6%-7% jump in prices. Wholesale is also expected to see a price jump of 27%-30%, the largest estimate of all food groups. Shoppers can see different prices of fruits and vegetables depending on how they like them.  Fresh fruit products are expected to rise 5%-6%, while fresh vegetables are estimated to have a 1%-2% jump in prices, the smallest prediction of any foods.

This crisis could throw up to 1.7 billion people – over one-fifth of humanity – into poverty, destitution and hunger on a scale not seen in decades.  Ukraine and the Russian Federation provide about 30% of the world’s wheat and barley, one-fifth of its maize and more than half of its sunflower oil. Together, their grain feeds the poorest and most vulnerable people, providing more than a third of the wheat imported by 45 African and least-developed countries.  At the same time, Russia is the world’s top natural gas exporter and second-largest oil exporter.  Increasing energy supply:President Biden has options. He just needs to use them. But the war is preventing farmers from tending their crops, while closing ports, ending grain exports, disrupting supply chains and sending prices skyrocketing.   Many developing countries are still struggling to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with historic debt burdens and soaring inflation.  Since the start of 2022, wheat and maize prices have increased by 30%.  Brent oil prices have risen more than 60% over the past year, while natural gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled.  The United Nations’ own lifesaving operations are under severe strain. The World Food Program has warned that it faces the impossible choice of taking from the hungry to feed the starving. It urgently needs $8 billion to support its operations in Yemen, Chad and Niger.  Some countries are already sliding from vulnerability to crisis and serious social unrest. And we know the roots of many conflicts lie in poverty, inequality, underdevelopment and hopelessness.   SURGE IN ENERGY COSTS: The biggest weapon in the Ukraine-Russia war may be energy But while much of the world has stepped up in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, there is no sign of the same support for the 1.7 billion other potential victims of this war.  We have a clear moral duty to support them, everywhere.  The Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance that I launched last month aims to develop coordinated solutions to these interlinked crises, with governments, international financial institutions and other key partners. I thank the global leaders in all sectors who are supporting this initiative.   On food, we are urging all countries to keep markets open, resist hoarding and unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions, and make reserves available to countries at the highest risk of hunger and famine.  This is not the time for protectionism.

Zavatska, ranked the No. 201 tennis player in the world, was born in Lutsk, Ukraine, where much of her extended family remain. Her dad was scheduled to join her at her apartment in France beginning Feb. 24 and subsequently accompany her to tournaments, but Russia's bombings began that day.   Ever since, the lives of Zavatska and countless other Ukrainians have become a hellish cycle of daily phone calls back home to confirm the safety and whereabouts of their loved ones, refreshing news sites for updates from reporters on the ground all while attempting to continue with the routines of their much more stable lives. SPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now for daily updates sent to your inbox UKRAINE LIVE UPDATES:New US sanctions will force Russia to focus on economy over war, officials say This week, Asheville is serving as the latest sanctuary for Zavatska and the rest of the four-member team of Ukrainians who will face Team U.S.A. in a Billie Jean King Cup qualifying tie at Harrah's Cherokee Center on Friday and Saturday, an event that will raise money for Ukrainian relief efforts. ""It's very tough,"" Zavatska said at a press conference Tuesday. ""There is no one day that we don't think about it. ... But on the other side, we just have to live. For example me, what I can do is to play tournaments, to earn money, to send to my family to help them."" Some players, including BJK Cup team member Dayana Yastremska, had to flee the country themselves after the beginning of the war. Yastremska (the No. 93 player in the world) and her 15-year-old sister took a small boat from Ukraine to Romania, and then continued along to Lyon, France, where she rejoined the professional tennis tour, she told ESPN. As they've bounced across the world for tournaments each week, the Ukrainians on the WTA circuit have kept tabs on their families. Ukrainian coach and BJK team captain Olga Savchuk has relatives in a bomb shelter; some of Zavatska's family did relocate to her home base in France, while many others are still in her hometown. ""We live in two different realities,"" Savchuk said. ""How can I even have a cup of tea right now? My family is like, underground. I have goosebumps when I even talk about it."" From Lyon, to Indian Wells, to Bogota, to Charleston and wherever else the players have found themselves playing since the war began, they have continued to focus on one of the few things they have control over, fighting to win points and matches as they've done since they were children.  ""Day-by-day for me, the court was the only place where I could live my life, because there was a ball, there was a racquet, and I just have to hit it and not think about it,"" Zavatska said. ""It's the most amazing thing, what a chance to play tennis and to be on the court, to be able to do something like that."" Even in more ordinary times, a professional tennis player's life is nomadic and often isolated. Only the players at the very top of the sport can afford to bring multiple team members along with them to every tournament they play, and that's of little use once the match starts. Team events such as the BJK Cup, then, can be welcome changes for all players, and are especially so for the Ukrainians this week.  ""It will be something very special, I would say,"" Savchuk said. ""I'm sure we're going to have, also, support from American people as well, because we feel that even outside of tennis. ... We are proud to have this chance and opportunity."" Tennis fans, players and organizations have rallied for Ukraine across the world in a variety of ways, and that will continue over the weekend in Asheville. Billie Jean King is personally donating $50,000 to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund, the United States Tennis Association is donating 10% of ticket revenue from the event, and local sponsors have also pledged donations based on ticket sales.  Team USA and the Ukrainians scheduled a group dinner for Tuesday night, an event traditionally organized formally by the International Tennis Federation but that has been left off the official BJK Cup schedules since the beginning of the pandemic. ""Very kind, very generous and very nice from them to be welcomed like this,"" Zavatska said. ""Have a dinner together. ... Just to be like normal people."" At times, that relative sense of normalcy has been a cause of guilt for the Ukrainians continuing the tennis grind halfway across the world from loved ones whose lives have been completely upended by the violence. But the players have made an uneasy peace with their current arrangement, and this week, Asheville will serve as the backdrop to their latest quest: qualify for the BJK Cup finals as a country. ""It kills you physically. Even though you're not in Ukraine, you're worried every day, every second for your family, all the people in Ukraine,"" Zavatska said. ""For me, being on court was a little bit, like, unreal, you know? Now ... when I'm getting a bit maybe like stressed on the court or something, I'm thinking about, Why would I be stressed? There is so much more going on, so it's just a tennis match. ""Yeah, just every day I just keep my focus on this ball, yellow ball, and that's it. Yeah, it's only like that every day."""

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know, Wednesday the 13th of April 2022. Today, the latest from a subway attack in New York, plus Biden calls Russia's war in Ukraine genocide, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ At least 29 people were injured in Brooklyn, New York yesterday, when an attacker set off smoke grenades and shot at passengers inside a subway car. Authorities say the gunman just before 8:30 AM during Tuesday rush hour fired 33 times with a semi handgun, which was found at the scene. Investigators also found two non-detonated smoke grenades, a hatchet, gasoline, fireworks, and a key to a U-Haul van. That key led police to a 62 year old named Frank James, though authorities have not yet formally called him a suspect. NYPD Chief of Detectives, James Essig. James Essig: The male who we believe is the renter of this U-Haul in Philadelphia is a Frank R. James. Male, 62 years old with addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia. We are endeavoring to locate him to determine his connection to the subway shooting, if any. The two crime scenes, the subway and the van, are very active and are still being processed. We are asking for anyone's help with information, cell phone video, witness information, or if they can identify the perpetrator or the renter of this vehicle. Investigators are looking into social media posts appearing to be linked to James, where he mentioned homelessness and New York City mayor Eric Adams. They're also reviewing social media pages that seem to feature James discussing a variety of issues from Black rights and slavery to the recent mass shooting in Sacramento. The accounts feature videos with ramblings of violent threats and Black superiority. One video of particular interest to police was posted in February showing a clip from the 1967 movie The Incident. In it, attackers lock passengers inside a New York City subway car and terrorize them. Footage shows a Black couple being racially harassed by a bigoted white aggressor. So far, no one has died in the attack, but witnesses like Tim O'Donnell said the scene was chaotic. Tim O’Donnell: So I got on the train and at first I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. There's usually delays in the morning, that kind of thing. And I saw a lot of people come off. There's a little bit of confusion about what to do. Should we get on this train? What's the deal. And then over the loud speaker we just hear, ""Hey everyone, get out of the station. There's no trains operating out of 36 north or south bound."" And I came out of the station and it was evident that something was wrong. I saw a lot of people trying to get out of the train station once they made the announcement. And at first I just thought, hey, they got to get to work. They're trying to get out of here. But no, it was evident that something was wrong. Someone screamed fire, which caused a lot of commotion. People started really trying to get out of their seat to get out of the train. And then once I was above ground, you could see all the fire trucks and all the cop cars, it was evident something was really, really wrong. The attack comes amid an ongoing conversation in New York about gun violence. The NYPD says transit crime has increased 68% compared with last year. And while police data on violence is not wholly independent, some New Yorkers say they are worried. Miguel Romano is the parent of school-aged kids and wants more police in stations. Miguel Romano: Got to put more law enforcement in the subways. I mean, New York City's on fire. New York City's been on fire since the de Blasio administration to be honest with you. But you know, hopefully this new man can do something about it. But parent Tatiana Solano says many New Yorkers don't have a choice but to keep taking the subway and to hope for the best. Tatiana Solano: I feel like it happens. We're going through strange times, but it's something that we have to do every day. We have to commute. Some take the train, some take the bus, but we all have places to get to. Mayor Eric Adams previously released a safety plan this year as part of efforts to lower crime on the subway. President Joe Biden is calling Russia's war in Ukraine, genocide. Joe Biden: Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian. And the evidence of mounting. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Biden's comments, tweeting, ""True words of a true leader. Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil."" Zelenskyy had called on Western leaders to use the term to describe Russia's invasion of his country. A United Nations treaty defines genocide as actions taken with the ""intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Past American leaders have often stayed away from using that word since it can trigger an obligation under international convention to intervene. But Biden said it would be up to lawyers to decide if Russia's conduct met the international standard for genocide. Meanwhile, for his part, Russian president Vladimir Putin said yesterday that his government had no choice but to invade and that it aimed to protect people in Eastern Ukraine. He also said that it would ""continue until its full completion and the fulfillment of the tasks that had been set."" Military strategists say that Russia believes local separatist support in Eastern Ukraine, along with logistics and terrain in the region, favor its larger military. Russia is shifting its efforts there after a largely unsuccessful ground offensive in Ukraine's north and west. But Russia did for weeks shell civilian areas from the air in those regions. Russia was unable to penetrate the capital of Kyiv, but its suburbs have seen some of the wars worst destruction. European resident Oksana Lyul'ka was using work gloves to clean up the glass in her living room, inside a home that was barely recognizable. Oksana Lyul'ka: We feel just empty because all of us, we have a piece of heart here. It's our houses. So I felt terrible actually. Especially when I saw from outside my apartment, my building, it's very hard to see. Our main problem now it's Russians still in our country. So we have to win war and then we will decide. The houses, it's not really the most important thing in our life. Of course we all feel pain and it's hard and it's terrible, but people are suffering. People are dying. And this is the main problem for now. The war has driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, including nearly two thirds of the country's children. California is trying to become the first state in the country to make a four day work week law. Reporter Scott Gleeson says the state introduced a bill that would make the official work week 32 hours instead of 40 for companies with 500 employees or more. Scott Gleeson: What they're doing really just kind of mirrors a lot of what's being put in place with a federal bill that's being proposed. And I think what we're seeing is that this is a trend that's been happening worldwide and now it's starting to reach the States. So California's wanting to change the work week from 40 hours a week to 32 hours a week. And the whole goal and emphasis is to have better productivity. Studies have been shown in Iceland that they're just seeing a lot more of an uptick in productivity overall. And that's just as a result of ultimately working less, but really just capitalizing on those four days each week. So it's a big shift from when you're thinking about the industrial revolution. We're so used to and ingrained, as Americans especially, to this five day grind, the 40 hours each week. So 32 hours is definitely coming as a result of how things have changed and the pandemic is driving a lot of that. So on the employer's side, obvious this is one of those things where it can feel like a gamble where you're not getting as much time with your workers, but at the end of the day, it's about the quality over the quantity. And studies are showing that in other countries and California's really going off of that. So just this idea that you can get work done in less amount of time, it's a win-win for both sides in that regard. Because I think sometimes when people have that good work/life balance, you can see how spending time with family can have you recharged to come back and be much more productive, whereas those extra eight hours might be something that works in the reverse side of that. So it's put in place not to just benefit workers, but also ultimately to benefit employers as well. You can find Scott's full story in today's episode description. Well, it might be April, but blizzard conditions hit parts of Montana and North Dakota yesterday and heavy snow is again expected across the region today. Meanwhile, parts of the Central and Southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley will get more severe weather today. And there could be the threat of tornadoes or other severe storms from Illinois to Louisiana. Tax returns this year are 11.5% higher on average than last year. And some experts say investing that money is not a bad idea. Personal Finance and Markets Reporter Elisabeth Buchwald has more. Elisabeth Buchwald: The major advantage of investing your refund is that it will grow. And if you just put it in savings, it's not going to grow, but you could access it fairly easily. You don't have to pay any tax on that. But here you have the chance to see it go higher and it helps you save down the line for college and for retirement. Disadvantage would be that it's harder to take the money out. Whereas with the savings account, you could take it out at any time. You don't have to pay any penalty. If you put it in a retirement account and you want to take that money out because you need it and your lifestyle changes, it's not so easy. You have to sell things. Again, there's taxes that you'll have to pay. And then it's also risk. You could lose it all. There's no guarantee that stocks will go up. Over the long term stocks tend to do well. But over the short term, there's a lot of risks that you could be taking with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and creating this new climate. So basically you could lose it all, but you could also gain money. It's just, if you are going to be put in some kind of financial hardship from losing it all, if you're going to be late on one month's rent or have to take on more credit card debt, then investing your refund probably isn't a good idea. One thing I would say is that if you have a good amount of emergency savings, low levels of debt, then it's really a very good idea to think about investing your money. And if it really doesn't mean that much to you to lose that money, then get into some of the more risky stuff. If you really have considered your options and that losing your $3,000 refund won't make a dent in your life, put more risk in because you'll get a bigger reward if things turn out well. So that was kind of an interesting point that came out in my story. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us on your favorite podcast app seven mornings a week.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know, Wednesday the 13th of April 2022. Today, the latest from a subway attack in New York, plus Biden calls Russia's war in Ukraine genocide, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ At least 29 people were injured in Brooklyn, New York yesterday, when an attacker set off smoke grenades and shot at passengers inside a subway car. Authorities say the gunman just before 8:30 AM during Tuesday rush hour fired 33 times with a semi handgun, which was found at the scene. Investigators also found two non-detonated smoke grenades, a hatchet, gasoline, fireworks, and a key to a U-Haul van. That key led police to a 62 year old named Frank James, though authorities have not yet formally called him a suspect. NYPD Chief of Detectives, James Essig. James Essig: The male who we believe is the renter of this U-Haul in Philadelphia is a Frank R. James. Male, 62 years old with addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia. We are endeavoring to locate him to determine his connection to the subway shooting, if any. The two crime scenes, the subway and the van, are very active and are still being processed. We are asking for anyone's help with information, cell phone video, witness information, or if they can identify the perpetrator or the renter of this vehicle. Investigators are looking into social media posts appearing to be linked to James, where he mentioned homelessness and New York City mayor Eric Adams. They're also reviewing social media pages that seem to feature James discussing a variety of issues from Black rights and slavery to the recent mass shooting in Sacramento. The accounts feature videos with ramblings of violent threats and Black superiority. One video of particular interest to police was posted in February showing a clip from the 1967 movie The Incident. In it, attackers lock passengers inside a New York City subway car and terrorize them. Footage shows a Black couple being racially harassed by a bigoted white aggressor. So far, no one has died in the attack, but witnesses like Tim O'Donnell said the scene was chaotic. Tim O’Donnell: So I got on the train and at first I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. There's usually delays in the morning, that kind of thing. And I saw a lot of people come off. There's a little bit of confusion about what to do. Should we get on this train? What's the deal. And then over the loud speaker we just hear, ""Hey everyone, get out of the station. There's no trains operating out of 36 north or south bound."" And I came out of the station and it was evident that something was wrong. I saw a lot of people trying to get out of the train station once they made the announcement. And at first I just thought, hey, they got to get to work. They're trying to get out of here. But no, it was evident that something was wrong. Someone screamed fire, which caused a lot of commotion. People started really trying to get out of their seat to get out of the train. And then once I was above ground, you could see all the fire trucks and all the cop cars, it was evident something was really, really wrong. The attack comes amid an ongoing conversation in New York about gun violence. The NYPD says transit crime has increased 68% compared with last year. And while police data on violence is not wholly independent, some New Yorkers say they are worried. Miguel Romano is the parent of school-aged kids and wants more police in stations. Miguel Romano: Got to put more law enforcement in the subways. I mean, New York City's on fire. New York City's been on fire since the de Blasio administration to be honest with you. But you know, hopefully this new man can do something about it. But parent Tatiana Solano says many New Yorkers don't have a choice but to keep taking the subway and to hope for the best. Tatiana Solano: I feel like it happens. We're going through strange times, but it's something that we have to do every day. We have to commute. Some take the train, some take the bus, but we all have places to get to. Mayor Eric Adams previously released a safety plan this year as part of efforts to lower crime on the subway. President Joe Biden is calling Russia's war in Ukraine, genocide. Joe Biden: Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian. And the evidence of mounting. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Biden's comments, tweeting, ""True words of a true leader. Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil."" Zelenskyy had called on Western leaders to use the term to describe Russia's invasion of his country. A United Nations treaty defines genocide as actions taken with the ""intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" Past American leaders have often stayed away from using that word since it can trigger an obligation under international convention to intervene. But Biden said it would be up to lawyers to decide if Russia's conduct met the international standard for genocide. Meanwhile, for his part, Russian president Vladimir Putin said yesterday that his government had no choice but to invade and that it aimed to protect people in Eastern Ukraine. He also said that it would ""continue until its full completion and the fulfillment of the tasks that had been set."" Military strategists say that Russia believes local separatist support in Eastern Ukraine, along with logistics and terrain in the region, favor its larger military. Russia is shifting its efforts there after a largely unsuccessful ground offensive in Ukraine's north and west. But Russia did for weeks shell civilian areas from the air in those regions. Russia was unable to penetrate the capital of Kyiv, but its suburbs have seen some of the wars worst destruction. European resident Oksana Lyul'ka was using work gloves to clean up the glass in her living room, inside a home that was barely recognizable. Oksana Lyul'ka: We feel just empty because all of us, we have a piece of heart here. It's our houses. So I felt terrible actually. Especially when I saw from outside my apartment, my building, it's very hard to see. Our main problem now it's Russians still in our country. So we have to win war and then we will decide. The houses, it's not really the most important thing in our life. Of course we all feel pain and it's hard and it's terrible, but people are suffering. People are dying. And this is the main problem for now. The war has driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, including nearly two thirds of the country's children. California is trying to become the first state in the country to make a four day work week law. Reporter Scott Gleeson says the state introduced a bill that would make the official work week 32 hours instead of 40 for companies with 500 employees or more. Scott Gleeson: What they're doing really just kind of mirrors a lot of what's being put in place with a federal bill that's being proposed. And I think what we're seeing is that this is a trend that's been happening worldwide and now it's starting to reach the States. So California's wanting to change the work week from 40 hours a week to 32 hours a week. And the whole goal and emphasis is to have better productivity. Studies have been shown in Iceland that they're just seeing a lot more of an uptick in productivity overall. And that's just as a result of ultimately working less, but really just capitalizing on those four days each week. So it's a big shift from when you're thinking about the industrial revolution. We're so used to and ingrained, as Americans especially, to this five day grind, the 40 hours each week. So 32 hours is definitely coming as a result of how things have changed and the pandemic is driving a lot of that. So on the employer's side, obvious this is one of those things where it can feel like a gamble where you're not getting as much time with your workers, but at the end of the day, it's about the quality over the quantity. And studies are showing that in other countries and California's really going off of that. So just this idea that you can get work done in less amount of time, it's a win-win for both sides in that regard. Because I think sometimes when people have that good work/life balance, you can see how spending time with family can have you recharged to come back and be much more productive, whereas those extra eight hours might be something that works in the reverse side of that. So it's put in place not to just benefit workers, but also ultimately to benefit employers as well. You can find Scott's full story in today's episode description. Well, it might be April, but blizzard conditions hit parts of Montana and North Dakota yesterday and heavy snow is again expected across the region today. Meanwhile, parts of the Central and Southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley will get more severe weather today. And there could be the threat of tornadoes or other severe storms from Illinois to Louisiana. Tax returns this year are 11.5% higher on average than last year. And some experts say investing that money is not a bad idea. Personal Finance and Markets Reporter Elisabeth Buchwald has more. Elisabeth Buchwald: The major advantage of investing your refund is that it will grow. And if you just put it in savings, it's not going to grow, but you could access it fairly easily. You don't have to pay any tax on that. But here you have the chance to see it go higher and it helps you save down the line for college and for retirement. Disadvantage would be that it's harder to take the money out. Whereas with the savings account, you could take it out at any time. You don't have to pay any penalty. If you put it in a retirement account and you want to take that money out because you need it and your lifestyle changes, it's not so easy. You have to sell things. Again, there's taxes that you'll have to pay. And then it's also risk. You could lose it all. There's no guarantee that stocks will go up. Over the long term stocks tend to do well. But over the short term, there's a lot of risks that you could be taking with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and creating this new climate. So basically you could lose it all, but you could also gain money. It's just, if you are going to be put in some kind of financial hardship from losing it all, if you're going to be late on one month's rent or have to take on more credit card debt, then investing your refund probably isn't a good idea. One thing I would say is that if you have a good amount of emergency savings, low levels of debt, then it's really a very good idea to think about investing your money. And if it really doesn't mean that much to you to lose that money, then get into some of the more risky stuff. If you really have considered your options and that losing your $3,000 refund won't make a dent in your life, put more risk in because you'll get a bigger reward if things turn out well. So that was kind of an interesting point that came out in my story. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us on your favorite podcast app seven mornings a week.

The U.S. inflation rate hit 8.5% in March over the past 12 months – the largest 12-month increase since December 1981 when ""Falcon Crest"" debuted on Friday nights on CBS right after ""Dallas.""  Gas prices alone rose 48% in March, contributing to the unsteady feeling that consumers have about their wealth and the health of the U.S. economy. Oddly enough, the IRS has a form relating to an inflation play for savings that some late filers still have time to consider. We're edging closer to the April 18 deadline for filing federal income tax returns, Michigan returns and city of Detroit and other communities.  While many people never heard of this tax tip, taxpayers can file what's called Form 8888 to use at least part of their federal income tax refund to directly buy inflation-indexed savings bonds when they're filing their federal tax returns.  True, until inflation started heating up, many people heard more about bitcoin than I Bonds.  Now, though, I Bonds are paying the highest inflation-adjusted rates since they were introduced in September 1998, which makes sense since consumer prices haven't skyrocketed this much in roughly 40 years.  Savers began to do a serious double take in November when the annualized rate for new inflation-indexed savings bonds hit 7.12% for a six-month period. ►2022 tax guide:Key dates for filing and extensions, claiming credits and planning for refunds I Bond rates are far higher than the rates savers are getting on bank deposits. The average one-year certificate of deposit is yielding 0.22% now, up only slightly compared with a mere 0.18% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com.  Savers who shop around can find top-yielding CDs at 1.25% now, according to Bankrate.com, compared with 0.67% a year ago. I Bond rates aren't simple, unfortunately, to understand.  That 7.12% annualized I Bond rate applies to the first six months after you bought I Bonds from Nov. 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022.  The high rate ultimately kicks in for I Bonds bought before Nov. 1, 2021, too. When the high 7.12% annualized rate would start varies on the month when you bought the bond. Again, it applies to a six-month window.  Sales for I Bonds have been hitting records. I Bond purchases reached $1.31 billion in November, $3.04 billion in December, $3.538 billion in January, $1.246 billion in February, and $1.378 billion in March, according to the Government Monthly Statement of Public Debt. By contrast early last year, savers bought but $249 million in I Bonds in January 2021.  I Bonds outsold Series EE savings bonds for the past five months by $100 to $1, according to Pederson. (The Series EE rate is but 0.1% for bonds bought from November through April 30; the bonds, though, are guaranteed to double in value if kept for 20 years so longer-term savers would earn a considerably higher rate.)  And rates are likely to go higher – creating even more frenzy for the I Bond story. The latest inflation data allows for estimates about where rates for I Bonds will go in the future. The annualized rate, which will be announced on May 1, is likely to be around 9.6% for a six-month period, according to Daniel Pederson, a Monroe, Michigan-based savings bond expert and founder of www.BondHelper.com.  Again, the upcoming I Bond rate would apply for six months for purchases beginning May 1. Don't worry if you bought I Bonds previously, though, as you do get the new higher rate for a six-month period as well.  ►2022 taxes:Refunds are higher thanks to Child Tax Credit, third stimulus check ►Tax deadline this year:Not ready for the April 18 tax deadline? Here's how to file an extension. ►Record inflation:After a string of 40-year highs, will inflation slow down? Some economists think so. Believe it or not, taxpayers can allocate tax refund money to I Bonds if they use Form 8888. The instructions note that you are able to use at least part of your refund to buy up to $5,000 in paper or electronic I Bonds. (You cannot use Form 8888 if you're trying to claim refund money via an ""Injured Spouse Allocation."") If you have a $6,000 refund, for example, you'll be able to buy only $5,000 in I Bonds and can directly deposit the rest elsewhere.  The same form also allows you to directly deposit a refund or part of it into either two or three accounts at a bank or other financial institution, including a mutual fund or brokerage account.  When Pederson electronically filed his tax return in March, he included Form 8888 to use some of his refund money to buy I Bonds. ""I still haven't gotten the paper bonds yet,"" Pederson said.  When he gets them, he's going to pay close attention to the issue date to see what rate first kicks in. He maintains that given when he filed his return he should be getting the rate before the new rate hits May 1.  Not surprisingly, his tax professional did not see a flood of taxpayers using Form 8888 to buy I Bonds.  What issue date would you get?  The Internal Revenue Service notes that I Bonds won't be issued until the agency completes processing your tax return.  The return process needs to be completed, the IRS said, in case there are changes in the actual refund amount. The instructions for Form 8888 point out that I Bonds wouldn't be issued, for example, if your refund is decreased because of a math error. And I Bonds wouldn't be issued if your federal income tax refund is offset for any reason to cover an unpaid debt owed to state and federal agencies and then the refund ends up being sent to you in the form of a check.  The amount you buy in I Bonds via your tax refund must be in multiples of $50 or the request will be rejected. A bond request that's for $438 would be rejected. You'd have to request $400 in I Bonds in this example and take the remaining $38 via direct deposit elsewhere.  Dollar limits exist for I Bond purchases each year. The tax refund route enables you to buy up to $5,000 in I Bonds on top of other limits. The annual limit is $10,000 in I Bonds that can be bought each calendar year per person. You buy savings bonds at www.TreasuryDirect.gov and hold them in an online account.  You can no longer buy savings bonds in person at banks.  Paper I Bonds are only available if you allocate all or part of your income tax refund to I Bonds on Form 8888 when you file your tax return.  ►I Bonds:What's not to love? The US savings bond with inflation protection gets ignored ►Profit during inflation?:These five tips could help investors beat rising prices The last thing anyone should do is cash out of I Bonds bought 15 years ago or so to buy these newer bonds.  The reason? Some older bonds still are paying far more than the new ones.  I Bonds bought before Nov. 1, 2001, for example, are the best of the bunch and have a fixed rate of 3% or higher. The highest fixed rate was 3.6% for I Bonds issued from May 2000 through October 2000. Savers holding older I Bonds with a fixed rate of 3% or higher would see an annualized rate of around 12.6% or more once that estimated May 1 rate kicks in. Savers who bought in future years saw that fixed rate drop a bit to around 2% or higher for I Bonds bought after late 2001 but before Nov. 1, 2002. Any inflation adjustment is added to that fixed rate.  As of November 2002, we were looking at a fixed rate of 1% or higher for I Bonds bought before May 1, 2008.  I Bonds bought after May 1, 2008, end up with much smaller fixed rates. Depending on when you bought the bond, the smaller fixed rates will vary. The fixed rate on I Bonds consistently has been 0% for bonds bought from May 2020.  If inflation cools in the next year or two, the inflation-adjusted rate would be lower but still added onto that 0% fixed rate.  One inflation-focused strategy suggests buying I Bonds before April 30 to lock in an exceptionally strong rate over a one-year time frame. The annualized rate of 7.12% for the first six months would start in April and run six months through September for bonds bought before April 30.  Then the same bonds would pay an estimated annualized rate of 9.6% from October through March.  Following this strategy, Pederson said, the average rate would end up being 8.36% over the 12 months.  It's important to know that you cannot cash I Bonds until you've held them for at least 12 months. And you'd lose the most recent three months of interest if you redeem the I Bonds within the first five years.  Even if you had to sell the I Bonds a bit more than a year after buying them, Pederson said, you'd be earning close to 5.96% after the penalty if you buy before the rate changes on May 1. (As April 30 is a Saturday, you'd want to buy the I Bonds a few days beforehand to make sure to get that April rate.)  Inflation could remain steady in the months ahead, given Russia's war against Ukraine and supply chain disruptions. But inflation could also cool down some, as the Federal Reserve moves to boost rates and Washington makes some moves to bring down the price of gas.  What's known now is the rate that's good through April 30 and we have a decent estimate for the six-month range after that.  I Bonds make sense for savers who want to snag significantly higher rates than if they parked that money in a one-year certificate of deposit.  ContactSusan Tompor via stompor@freepress.com.

Any inflation adjustment is added to that fixed rate.  As of November 2002, we were looking at a fixed rate of 1% or higher for I Bonds bought before May 1, 2008.  I Bonds bought after May 1, 2008, end up with much smaller fixed rates. Depending on when you bought the bond, the smaller fixed rates will vary. The fixed rate on I Bonds consistently has been 0% for bonds bought from May 2020.  If inflation cools in the next year or two, the inflation-adjusted rate would be lower but still added onto that 0% fixed rate.  One inflation-focused strategy suggests buying I Bonds before April 30 to lock in an exceptionally strong rate over a one-year time frame. The annualized rate of 7.12% for the first six months would start in April and run six months through September for bonds bought before April 30.  Then the same bonds would pay an estimated annualized rate of 9.6% from October through March.  Following this strategy, Pederson said, the average rate would end up being 8.36% over the 12 months.  It's important to know that you cannot cash I Bonds until you've held them for at least 12 months. And you'd lose the most recent three months of interest if you redeem the I Bonds within the first five years.  Even if you had to sell the I Bonds a bit more than a year after buying them, Pederson said, you'd be earning close to 5.96% after the penalty if you buy before the rate changes on May 1. (As April 30 is a Saturday, you'd want to buy the I Bonds a few days beforehand to make sure to get that April rate.)  Inflation could remain steady in the months ahead, given Russia's war against Ukraine and supply chain disruptions. But inflation could also cool down some, as the Federal Reserve moves to boost rates and Washington makes some moves to bring down the price of gas.  What's known now is the rate that's good through April 30 and we have a decent estimate for the six-month range after that.  I Bonds make sense for savers who want to snag significantly higher rates than if they parked that money in a one-year certificate of deposit.  ContactSusan Tompor via stompor@freepress.com.

James was due to appear in court Thursday on a charge that pertains to terrorist or other violent attacks against mass transit systems and carries a sentence of up to life in prison, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace said. The attack unfolded when police say a man opened fire on a Brooklyn subway train during morning rush hour.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Saturday, April 15, as Russia's invasion continues. The storied Russian warship Moskva, whose proud history goes back to days of the Cold War, sank into the Black Sea on Thursday in the latest blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Losing the vessel, built in Ukraine during the Soviet era and named after the Russian capital, represents a military setback and symbolic defeat for Russia as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after stumbling in the north. The Russian Defense Ministry said the Moskva -- flagship of the country's Black Sea fleet -- was being towed to port when it ""lost its stability due to damage to the hull received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In the conditions of stormy seas, the ship sank."" The crew, usually totaling about 500, had been evacuated, the ministry said. The Pentagon couldn't confirm the source of the damage, but Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser with two missiles. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine's president, called the ship's sinking an event of “colossal significance."" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said it mattered little whether the ship was hit by a missile or victimized by an unrelated fire. “They’ve had to kind of choose between two stories: One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other was that they came under attack,"" Sullivan said. ""Neither is a particularly good outcome for them.""

World Food Program, said the residents of Mariupol are being “starved to death” by the Russian siege and warned that the war's impact on grain-exporting Ukraine risks destabilizing nations far from its shores and triggering mass migrations. ►Britain’s Foreign Office said it's freezing the assets worth up to 10 billion pounds ($13.1 billion) belonging to two Russian oligarchs -- Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich -- described as longstanding business associates of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. ►Russian news reports say a criminal case has been opened against Mikhail Afanasyev, a Siberian journalist who was arrested after his news website published content critical of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. ►President Joe Biden said no decision has been made yet on sending a Cabinet-level U.S. official to Ukraine to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaders of several other nations have visited Kyiv in a show of support. ►In one of the most crucial battles of the war, Russia said more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops had surrendered in the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where Ukrainian forces have been holding out in pockets of the city. A Ukrainian official denied the claim, which could not be verified. Two children who were injured last week when Russian forces attacked a train station in the Eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk have died, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said Thursday. Their deaths bring the toll from the attack to 59, including seven children, the ministry said. Dozens more were injured in what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called a ""war crime."" Russia's rocket strike came as thousands of Ukrainians were attempting to flee amid the invaders' new focus on the region. Russians denied targeting the train station after the attack. Photos of the train station after the attack showed luggage and other personal belongings scattered across the platform, bodies covered by tarps and blood on the ground. The ministry posted a photo of a bloody stuffed toy and said it would be sent to the United Nations ""as proof of this barbaric crime."" European officials appear ready to grab the third rail of sanctions on Moscow for its assault on Ukraine. The continents' political leaders are drafting a measure to ban imports of Russian oil products, a move previously regarded as a non-starter because of Europe's heavy dependence on Russian energy, the New York Times reported.  The European Union relies on Russia for 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil, and the group's 27 members would have to approve the measure. Germany, the EU's wealthiest country, has been considered the biggest opponent of the oil embargo, which would almost certainly fuel inflation in Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been playing up the likelihood the continent would suffer economically if it suddenly dispensed with his country's supply of energy, which would not be easily replaced. The entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO would force Russia to strengthen its northwestern borders and place nuclear weapons in the region, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday. Medvedev noted on his Telegram channel that the length of Russia's land border with the NATO alliance would more than double. One of Russia's explanations for its invasion of Ukraine was concern over possible NATO expansion there. “Naturally, these borders will have to be strengthened. The grouping of ground forces and air defense will be seriously strengthened, and significant naval forces will be deployed in the waters of the Gulf of Finland,” Medvedev wrote, adding that keeping the region's non-nuclear status is ""out of the question."" Russia has shipped more helicopters to eastern Ukraine, and the Pentagon anticipates more troops will be deployed there as the invading army turns its attention away from Kyiv and toward the disputed Donbas region, said a senior Pentagon official who described intelligence assessments on condition of anonymity.  The terrain in eastern Ukraine is flatter and less forested than the northern part of the country, where local forces repelled the Russian invasion that began Feb. 24. Russian tanks and armored vehicles that were shredded around Kyiv should be better suited to eastern Ukraine, which the official compared to Kansas. However, with the spring thaw, muddy ground will hamper mobility there, the official said. Moreover, the Russian logistics, which have failed to supply troops with food, fuel and ammunition, are mostly restricted to existing roads and railroads, the official said. China said Thursday that it will reject “any pressure or coercion"" over its relationship with Russia. A day earlier, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that China and other nations that subvert the West's sanctions against Russia could face future economic fallout for failing to help end Russia's ""heinous war"" in Ukraine.  ""Let's be clear: The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions,"" Yellen said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said his nation had “made considerable efforts to de-escalate the situation, defuse the crisis and rebuild peace."" China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by strategic partner Russia, or even refer to the conflict as a war. It has abstained or sided with Moscow in votes at the U.N. following the start of the war in February. President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for almost an hour Wednesday, one day after Zelenskyy praised Biden for accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""genocide."" Biden said in a statement that he has authorized an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including weapons and ammunition. ""The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect,'' Biden said. ""As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself.'' Zelenskyy tweeted that he and Biden discussed the new weapons shipment, enhanced sanctions against the Russians and seeking justice for their war crimes. In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy said he's “sincerely thankful” for the new U.S. military aid. THE NEWS COMES TO YOU:  Get the latest updates on the situation in Ukraine.

Odesa … [+3841 chars]","Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Thursday, April 14. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Saturday, April 15, as Russia's invasion continues. The storied Russian warship Moskva, whose proud history goes back to days of the Cold War, sank into the Black Sea on Thursday in the latest blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Losing the vessel, built in Ukraine during the Soviet era and named after the Russian capital, represents a military setback and symbolic defeat for Russia as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after stumbling in the north. The Russian Defense Ministry said the Moskva -- flagship of the country's Black Sea fleet -- was being towed to port when it ""lost its stability due to damage to the hull received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In the conditions of stormy seas, the ship sank."" The crew, usually totaling about 500, had been evacuated, the ministry said. The Pentagon couldn't confirm the source of the damage, but Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser with two missiles. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine's president, called the ship's sinking an event of “colossal significance."" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said it mattered little whether the ship was hit by a missile or victimized by an unrelated fire. “They’ve had to kind of choose between two stories: One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other was that they came under attack,"" Sullivan said. ""Neither is a particularly good outcome for them.""

Through ""extensive investigations,” officials were able to determine the owner of the yacht “despite offshore concealment,” the German Federal Criminal Police Office said in a tweet early Tuesday. The megaboat’s owner was determined to be Gulbakhor Ismailova, sister of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, German authorities confirmed to USA TODAY. The Office of Foreign Assets Controls ""is identifying Usmanov’s superyacht and aircraft as blocked property in which Usmanov has an interest,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY.  After police confirmed with authorities in Brussels that the owner was sanctioned, the luxury yacht, known as Dilbar, was legally commandeered. The 15,917-ton superyacht, which is hailed by its manufacturer as “one of the most complex and challenging yachts ever built,” is being held at the Port of Hamburg in Germany.  The Dilbar, named after Usmanov’s mother, is registered in the Cayman Islands and is estimated to be worth $600 million to $735 million. The vessel features two helipads and one of the world’s largest indoor pools ever housed on a yacht, according to the Treasury Department. Operating the ship takes an estimated $60 million a year.

The billionaire’s “vast holdings” across the Russian economy and abroad include the metal, mining, telecommunications and information technology industries, according to the department. He is known to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev.  “Usmanov and Putin allegedly have financial ties, while Medvedev has reportedly benefited from the personal use of luxurious residences controlled by Usmanov,” the department's statement said. The billionaire also owns 49% of the holding company USM, which did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. The United States announced sanctions against Russian elites and their family members March 3 to interrupt “direct and indirect” support to the Russian government amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two months ago. The European Union also targeted Usmanov.  “We are demonstrating our commitment to impose massive costs on Putin’s closest confidants and their family members and freeze their assets in response to the brutal attack on Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month in a statement announcing the sanctions."

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 14th of April 2022. Today, an arrest in the Brooklyn subway attack, plus how some people in Finland are preparing for the possibility of Russian invasion and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ A suspect in the case surrounding this week's Brooklyn subway has been arrested. 62-year-old Frank R. James was arrested yesterday after a manhunt that lasted more than 24 hours. NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig. James Essig: We believe, but this is still early in the investigation, that after firing his weapon 33 times at innocent New York City subway riders, Mr. James boarded an R Train that had pulled into the station, went one stop up and exited at 25th Street Station. The gun used in this - a nine millimeter Glock, which was recovered at this crime scene - was purchased by Mr. James in 2011 in Ohio. We tracked Mr. James and his last known whereabouts was 7th Avenue and 9th Street in Park Slope entering the subway. Minutes ago, thankfully, NYPD patrol officers from the 9th Precinct responded to St. Mark's and 1st Avenue where they apprehended him without incident. James is set to appear in court today on a charge related to terrorist or other violent acts against mass transit systems and carries a sentence of up to life in prison. He was arrested after calling himself into the city's crime stoppers line. The attack came Tuesday morning during rush hour in Brooklyn, New York's Sunset Park neighborhood. Authorities say the suspect put on a gas mask, threw two smoke grenades, and then opened fire 33 times at passengers as the train pulled into the station. Ten people were shot and at least 19 others were taken to hospitals. A motive is still not clear, but officials are investigating social media posts where the suspect threatened violence. More people in Finland are preparing for the possibility of war with Russia. In the week since Russia invaded Ukraine, thousands of Finns have signed up with training associations to sharpen their military skills or learn new ones like first aid. Reporter Tami Abdollah tells us why some feel threatened by their neighbors to the east. Tami Abdollah: Finland has a really fascinating history with Russia. They share a lengthy 830-mile border, and they have kind of traumatic memories of battles from the 20th century with Russia, including in the late 1930s when they were involved in what's known as the Winter War, and Russia invaded Finland without a declaration of war. In fact, a lot of Finnish folks harken back to that era. They remember it, even though it was 90-plus years ago, well, nearly 90 years ago, I should say. They recall how Russia invaded, and they lost 11% of their land. In fact, I spoke with a Finn who basically was like, ""Yeah, at the time, it was very, very similar to Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" They were against huge odds. The Finns fought fiercely and did better than most people thought. The League of Nations, which was the predecessor to the UN, in fact, kicked Russia out essentially for its illegal invasion. So there was a lot of harshness and harsh reaction from the world, but the Finns were essentially alone in their battle in the fighting on the ground. Similarly, Ukraine is essentially on its own in battling because it's not part of NATO. Russia has been very, very clear. In fact, I spoke with someone at the Defense Ministry in Finland who told me that they're aware that Russia has been incredibly clear. It does not want NATO on its border. Finland is not part of NATO and that, because it doesn't want the expansion of this Western defensive pact, it would consider that an aggressive move. So Finland, of course, is keeping that in mind. Obviously, we see how Russia reacted to even what they say was one of their reasons for invading Ukraine was to prevent it from joining NATO and going more westward. You can find Tami's full story in today's episode description. A Black man who was face down on the ground has been shot in the back of the head by a Grand Rapids Michigan police officer, killing him. Police released video yesterday of the April 6th shooting of Patrick Lyoya. It combined police footage, a home security camera, and a cell phone video showing the unnamed officer pull over the 26 year old for a license plate that he said didn't match the car. The two then struggled, and the officer was eventually lying on top of Lyoya before shooting him. This part is from the officer's body camera before a clip of video shot by a third party watching the incident. A warning, the following is graphic. Police: No, no, no. Stop, stop. Put your hands where I can see them. Stop. 1950, we've got one running. Stop. Stop. ...Stop. Taser. Dispatcher: How many you cars you got going? Drop, taser! Everyone. Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who represented the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others, is representing Lyoya's family. He released a statement yesterday demanding the officer be fired, arrested, and prosecuted. Crump and Lyoya's family are expected to hold a news conference this afternoon. Texas governor, Greg Abbott, is urging three other Mexican governors to come to an agreement after he and the governor of Nuevo León state announced yesterday that they'll end new additional border inspections in Texas at the Nuevo León crossing point. The move came after Governor Samuel García promised additional security steps on the Mexican side, but Governor Abbot said similar inspections would continue at other crossings along the Texas/Mexico border until other Mexican governors agree to similar deals. Border crossing delays last week turned into protests this week with truckers blocking traffic. Protests have affected crossings that handle some $440 billion a year in trade. Both the Biden administration and US Customs and Border Protection have criticized the Texas inspections as did Mexico's Department of Foreign Affairs. Abbot last week ordered state police to inspect shipments to Texas citing both cartels and immigration. But truckers interviewed say they already face strict inspections and wonder why they're being singled out. Many already cross back and forth between Texas and Mexico several times a day delivering goods to warehouses. Tax season is a bit less painful this year for many taxpayers thanks to larger than average refunds. Reporter Elisabeth Buchwald says refunds are averaging just over $3,200 so far this season. Elisabeth Buchwald: There's a couple reasons why refunds are coming in higher than last year. The first reason would be the Child Tax Credit. It was enhanced last year. So people who were getting around $2,000 for children six to 16 are now getting around $3,000. That also includes 17 year olds who previously weren't eligible, and then also you have the credit increasing for children under six from $2,000 to $3,600. Parents could have elected to have that in monthly payments from July to December, and then get the rest when they fill out their tax returns. But if they wanted to get it all at once, they could wait until they file their taxes. So that's going to trigger a bigger refund if they did that. The other thing is there's the Earned Income Tax Credit that was expanded, both dollar amount and eligibility. Some age restrictions were lifted. Also people who didn't get a third stimulus check, they can get that in the form of a refund when they file their taxes. Or if, for instance, they got a stimulus check but they had a child afterwards, they can still claim that extra $1,400 that you get from having a dependent. These are all a lot of things I would say tied to COVID stimulus that are helping boost these refunds going into this year. It seems that this year is unique from other years because of these COVID provisions. There aren't any plans that have been finalized at least to extend, for instance, the Child Tax Credit amounts that we were seeing in 2021. So if that doesn't get passed, then it will just go back to normal refunds. But that could change. There could be stimulus money going out especially for gas. Legislators are talking about that. But as of now, I would say don't expect this level of refunds for coming years. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us every day of the year wherever you like to find your podcasts.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 14th of April 2022. Today, an arrest in the Brooklyn subway attack, plus how some people in Finland are preparing for the possibility of Russian invasion and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ A suspect in the case surrounding this week's Brooklyn subway has been arrested. 62-year-old Frank R. James was arrested yesterday after a manhunt that lasted more than 24 hours. NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig. James Essig: We believe, but this is still early in the investigation, that after firing his weapon 33 times at innocent New York City subway riders, Mr. James boarded an R Train that had pulled into the station, went one stop up and exited at 25th Street Station. The gun used in this - a nine millimeter Glock, which was recovered at this crime scene - was purchased by Mr. James in 2011 in Ohio. We tracked Mr. James and his last known whereabouts was 7th Avenue and 9th Street in Park Slope entering the subway. Minutes ago, thankfully, NYPD patrol officers from the 9th Precinct responded to St. Mark's and 1st Avenue where they apprehended him without incident. James is set to appear in court today on a charge related to terrorist or other violent acts against mass transit systems and carries a sentence of up to life in prison. He was arrested after calling himself into the city's crime stoppers line. The attack came Tuesday morning during rush hour in Brooklyn, New York's Sunset Park neighborhood. Authorities say the suspect put on a gas mask, threw two smoke grenades, and then opened fire 33 times at passengers as the train pulled into the station. Ten people were shot and at least 19 others were taken to hospitals. A motive is still not clear, but officials are investigating social media posts where the suspect threatened violence. More people in Finland are preparing for the possibility of war with Russia. In the week since Russia invaded Ukraine, thousands of Finns have signed up with training associations to sharpen their military skills or learn new ones like first aid. Reporter Tami Abdollah tells us why some feel threatened by their neighbors to the east. Tami Abdollah: Finland has a really fascinating history with Russia. They share a lengthy 830-mile border, and they have kind of traumatic memories of battles from the 20th century with Russia, including in the late 1930s when they were involved in what's known as the Winter War, and Russia invaded Finland without a declaration of war. In fact, a lot of Finnish folks harken back to that era. They remember it, even though it was 90-plus years ago, well, nearly 90 years ago, I should say. They recall how Russia invaded, and they lost 11% of their land. In fact, I spoke with a Finn who basically was like, ""Yeah, at the time, it was very, very similar to Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" They were against huge odds. The Finns fought fiercely and did better than most people thought. The League of Nations, which was the predecessor to the UN, in fact, kicked Russia out essentially for its illegal invasion. So there was a lot of harshness and harsh reaction from the world, but the Finns were essentially alone in their battle in the fighting on the ground. Similarly, Ukraine is essentially on its own in battling because it's not part of NATO. Russia has been very, very clear. In fact, I spoke with someone at the Defense Ministry in Finland who told me that they're aware that Russia has been incredibly clear. It does not want NATO on its border. Finland is not part of NATO and that, because it doesn't want the expansion of this Western defensive pact, it would consider that an aggressive move. So Finland, of course, is keeping that in mind. Obviously, we see how Russia reacted to even what they say was one of their reasons for invading Ukraine was to prevent it from joining NATO and going more westward. You can find Tami's full story in today's episode description. A Black man who was face down on the ground has been shot in the back of the head by a Grand Rapids Michigan police officer, killing him. Police released video yesterday of the April 6th shooting of Patrick Lyoya. It combined police footage, a home security camera, and a cell phone video showing the unnamed officer pull over the 26 year old for a license plate that he said didn't match the car. The two then struggled, and the officer was eventually lying on top of Lyoya before shooting him. This part is from the officer's body camera before a clip of video shot by a third party watching the incident. A warning, the following is graphic. Police: No, no, no. Stop, stop. Put your hands where I can see them. Stop. 1950, we've got one running. Stop. Stop. ...Stop. Taser. Dispatcher: How many you cars you got going? Drop, taser! Everyone. Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who represented the families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others, is representing Lyoya's family. He released a statement yesterday demanding the officer be fired, arrested, and prosecuted. Crump and Lyoya's family are expected to hold a news conference this afternoon. Texas governor, Greg Abbott, is urging three other Mexican governors to come to an agreement after he and the governor of Nuevo León state announced yesterday that they'll end new additional border inspections in Texas at the Nuevo León crossing point. The move came after Governor Samuel García promised additional security steps on the Mexican side, but Governor Abbot said similar inspections would continue at other crossings along the Texas/Mexico border until other Mexican governors agree to similar deals. Border crossing delays last week turned into protests this week with truckers blocking traffic. Protests have affected crossings that handle some $440 billion a year in trade. Both the Biden administration and US Customs and Border Protection have criticized the Texas inspections as did Mexico's Department of Foreign Affairs. Abbot last week ordered state police to inspect shipments to Texas citing both cartels and immigration. But truckers interviewed say they already face strict inspections and wonder why they're being singled out. Many already cross back and forth between Texas and Mexico several times a day delivering goods to warehouses. Tax season is a bit less painful this year for many taxpayers thanks to larger than average refunds. Reporter Elisabeth Buchwald says refunds are averaging just over $3,200 so far this season. Elisabeth Buchwald: There's a couple reasons why refunds are coming in higher than last year. The first reason would be the Child Tax Credit. It was enhanced last year. So people who were getting around $2,000 for children six to 16 are now getting around $3,000.

The ""equity action plans"" were released on the same day Biden is visiting North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the largest historically Black college and university in the nation. It's his third visit to an HBCU as president. Other members of his cabinet, including the vice president, have made a combined dozen visits to HBCUs. “Equity goes to the heart of our success as a nation when the typical Black family has just 1/8 the wealth of the typical white family,” said Susan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser. ""When at least 35% of Americans in rural and tribal communities lack adequate high speed internet, that restricts growth and competitiveness well beyond rural America.""  The administration's investment in HBCUs is one the more than 300 concrete actions officials said are being taken to get in the ""guts of government"" to improve service  to underserved communities. Others include: The actions are an outgrowth of an executive order Biden signed his first day in office directing every federal agency to come up with ways to address any disparities in policies and programs. ""Delivering the promise of America is not the work of one department,"" Biden said in a video message Thursday. ""It has to be the business of the whole of the federal government."" Such efforts have gotten some pushback, including the Transportation Department's guidance that funding from a major infrastructure package will ""advance equitable access to transportation.” Republican lawmakers have complained to Biden that ""excessive consideration of equity, union memberships, or climate"" when implementing the infrastructure law passed last year would be counterproductive.  Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has said highway funding should not be ""a vehicle for the administration’s woke agenda.”  While the infrastructure package received bipartisan support, Republicans have blocked Democrats' sweeping voting rights bill. Bipartisan negotiations on police reform legislation broke down last year.  Democrats lack enough votes in the Senate to pass those bills over GOP opposition. Some civil rights groups have also pushed the administration to cancel student loan debt, which falls disproportionally on Black Americans.  Biden recently extended the moratorium on federal student loan payments through Aug. 31. He backed, during the 2020 campaign, forgiving up to $10,000 in debt per borrower.  While some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have pressed Biden to use his executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in debt, Biden has said he believes such action must come from Congress.  ""If Congress were to send him a bill to cancel $10,000 in student debt,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this month, ""he'd be happy to sign it.""

Several Facebook posts have questioned the cause of recent inflation, pinning the blame on the amount of money in circulation. ""Our government has printed over $8 trillion,"" reads text in a March 29 post, which includes a picture of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. ""And they're blaming inflation on Putin?"" Another post from March 21, based on a screenshot of a tweet, says something similar: ""They really printed 8 trillion dollars...Now food, rent and gas all higher than ever. And somehow convinced ppl this is about Russia.""  Other popular posts make the same claim. Together, the posts have garnered over a thousand shares and interactions. Social media users offered varying defenses of the $8 trillion figure, which caused confusion based on different meanings of the word ""printed."" Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks ""Printed"" money can refer to physical cash, but it is also used to refer to money ""created"" by the Federal Reserve via a computer that adds to the overall money supply. The originator of this claim – conservative group Turning Point Action – said it was referring to the Federal Reserve element, but many users took it to reference physical cash. ""Printing paper with nothing to back it up,"" wrote one commenter. ""Common sense knows where that will end up."" The post is potentially misleading in either case, however. The Federal Reserve does have a balance sheet of $9 trillion, but it hasn't added $8 trillion anytime recently. And that number isn't close to accurate in terms of physical cash, of which there is about $2 trillion currently in circulation, according to Lydia Washington, a spokesperson for the Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who posted the claim. The March 29 post includes a logo for Turning Point Action, the advocacy arm of Turning Point USA. The conservative group originally created the post, according to spokesperson Andrew Kolvet. In an email, Kolvet pointed to news reports from June 2021, which said the Federal Reserve's assets had topped $8 trillion. ""Printing"" is a common term for when the Federal Reserve injects non-paper money into the financial system. That was indeed a sharp increase from past practice, as the assets had hovered around $4 trillion from 2014 to 2020. The asset balance is currently about $9 trillion. But the post's use of the Biden picture implies a connection between that figure and his administration. But Federal Reserve assets have only grown by about $1.6 trillion since he took office in January 2021. More:Inflation rose at fastest pace in 40 years in March as consumer prices jumped 8.5% The only way the post's claim about ""printing"" $8 trillion in this fashion adds up is if one tallies the money injected by the Federal Reserve over the last decade and a half. The post contains no language referencing such an extended timespan. The large-scale virtual printing starting in 2020 occurred as the Fed attempted to prop up an American economy seriously slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In exchange for adding newly-made, non-paper dollars to major banks in the U.S., the Fed is receiving large amounts of bonds. As a result, banks have more cash on hand and are more willing to lend that cash. Combined with lower interest rates, those who need to borrow money find it easier to do so. Another social media user who shared the claim told USA TODAY it was based on data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis showing the amount of ""M1"" currency in circulation. While M1 currency includes cash, it also includes other liquid categories such as money in checking accounts. As a result, M1 data shouldn't be used to draw conclusions about the amount of printed currency in circulation. The $8 trillion is even further off base in terms of the physical cash printed – which many social media users thought the post was referring to. Fact check: $1.5 trillion spending bill passed with bipartisan support in Congress Physical money in the U.S. comes from several different sources. Coins are produced by the Mint, while printed dollars of all denominations are made by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The amount of currency the bureau produces is determined by the Fed, which sends annual print orders. Once that money is printed, the Fed ships currency to 28 cash offices, which then distribute the money to banks. The order for fiscal year 2021 – which ended in September 2021 – resulted in $325 billion being printed, Washington said. For the ongoing 2022 fiscal year, the Fed has issued a print order ranging from $310 to $356 billion. More:Is the U.S. headed for a recession? This Wall Street bank thinks so. That's an increase from print orders of around $200 billion in 2019 and 2020, driven higher by the COVID-19 pandemic. The volume is based on the board's estimate of currency demand in the coming year. That estimate is determined by forecasted currency inventories, destruction rates of unfit notes, trends in net payments and other factors, the print order says. Based on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that the U.S. has printed $8 trillion. There is indeed more than $8 trillion in assets on the Federal Reserve balance sheet (now $9 trillion, actually), but it was added intermittently dating back to 2008. Less than $2 trillion has been added during Biden's administration.  Many social media users are interpreting this as a reference to the amount of physical currency in circulation, which is far from accurate. The government printed about $300 billion in each of the last two fiscal years.

It’s celebrated for eight days, except in Israel where it’s celebrated for seven. This year’s Passover starts Friday and ends April 23. Friday is also Good Friday, the Friday before Easter Sunday. The two holidays are later than usual this year — Easter Sunday is uncommonly late, falling on April 17 for the first time in 62 years. Both holidays are linked to the moon: Easter occurs after the Paschal Moon, and the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles. Players and organizations across Major League Baseball will honor Jackie Robinson Friday, the 75th anniversary of Robinson breaking the major league color barrier. Robinson made history – and helped usher in the civil rights movement – in 1947 when he made his Brooklyn Dodgers debut against the Boston Braves at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. As part of Jackie Robinson Day, all major league players, managers, coaches and umpires will wear Robinson's No. 42 in Dodger blue for the first time. MLB retired Robinson's number in 1997 and all uniformed personnel have worn 42 on Jackie Robinson Day since 2009. The Dodgers will play at home in Los Angeles Friday night, facing the Cincinnati Reds (10:10 p.m. ET, Apple TV+). They will be joined by Robinson's 99-year-old widow, Rachel, and her son David. Earlier in the day, several Dodgers players will take part in events in Pasadena, California, where Robinson grew up.  After two solid nights of action earlier this week, the NBA's play-in tournament will conclude Friday night with two more win-or-go-home matchups as the last teams to take part in the playoffs will be decided. First, in an Eastern Conference matchup, Darius Garland and the Cleveland Cavaliers will host Trae Young and the Atlanta Hawks (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). The Cavaliers may have injured center and second leading scorer Jarrett Allen for the game. Allen fractured his left middle finger on March 6 and has missed 19 consecutive games. The winner of the game will be the East's No. 8 seed and face the Miami Heat in the first round. Later in the Western Conference, CJ McCollum and the New Orleans Pelicans visit Los Angeles to play Paul George and the Clippers (10 p.m. ET, TNT). The winner of that matchup will be the No. 8 seed in the West and earn a best-of-seven clash with the Phoenix Suns, who finished the regular season 64-18, the NBA's best record.

He cited police data indicating that 95% of the casualties had died from sniper fire and gunshot wounds. He added that more bodies were being found every day, under the rubble and in mass graves. “Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,” Nebytov said. “The number of killed civilians has surpassed 900 — and I emphasize, these are civilians, whose bodies we have discovered and handed over for forensic examination.” He added: “The most victims were found in Bucha, where there are more than 350 corpses.” According to Nebytov, utilities workers in Bucha had been gathering up and burying bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Nebytov added that Russian troops were “tracking down” people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views.

China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by strategic partner Russia, or even refer to the conflict as a war.  ROME — The war in Ukraine loomed over the traditional Good Friday procession at the Colosseum in Rome because the Vatican’s choice of a Russian woman as one of the cross-bearers angered Ukrainians. Participants in the solemn torchlit procession in the ancient arena Friday night took turns carrying a plain, tall and slim cross as part of the commemoration of Jesus’ suffering and death by crucifixion. Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican and the archbishop of Kyiv earlier this week denounced the Vatican’s plan to have a Ukrainian woman and a Russian woman carry the cross together during the procession. They objected to projecting what they saw as the idea of reconciliation while Ukraine is ravaged by war unleashed by Russia. The Vatican didn’t respond to the protests. Pope Francis has denounced the Feb. 24 invasion and attacks on Ukraine as a “sacrilege,″ but has refrained from naming Russia as the aggressor. Other faithful applauded the decision to pair the two women.

Oleh Sinehubov said Friday in a Telegram post that 34 other people were wounded. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has been heavily hit by shelling and rocket attacks during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The city’s position about 25 miles south of Russia and 100 miles north of the separatist eastern regions of Ukraine gives it significant strategic importance. — Associated Press Two Ukrainian Neptune missiles struck the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, which later sank, according to a senior U.S. Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Pentagon officials had previously said they could not confirm the Ukrainian claim, but they also did not refute it. The warship Moskva, which has a history that goes back to days of the Cold War, sank into the Black Sea on Thursday in the latest blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Losing the vessel, built in Ukraine during the Soviet era and named after the Russian capital, represents a military setback and symbolic defeat for Russia as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after stumbling in the north. -Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY; The Associated Press Ukrainian officials are using facial recognition technology to scan the faces of Russian troops who have died in Ukraine and notify their families, according to a report from The Washington Post. Ukraine has scanned more than 8,600 faces and notified hundreds of families since Russia invaded the country using software from the U.S. firm Clearview AI, according to the Post. The country's IT Army, which comprises volunteer hackers and activists, told the outlet they also sometimes send photos of the abandoned bodies of soldiers to their families. The aim is to cause dissent from Russians and discourage other fighters, the Post reported. But critics said it could be a form of psychological warfare.  ""If it were Russian soldiers doing this with Ukrainian mothers, we might say, ‘Oh, my God, that’s barbaric,'"" said Stephanie Hare, a London-based surveillance researcher, told the Post. ""And is it actually working? Or is it making them say: ‘Look at these lawless, cruel Ukrainians, doing this to our boys?'"" A Clearview AI executive told the Post that Ukrainians are also using the software to confirm the identities of people at military checkpoints and make sure no Russians infiltrate. Hoan Ton-That, the chief executive, told the outlet that it could deter Russian troops from committing war crimes if they fear being identified by the software. Moscow on Friday said it will expel 18 members of the European Union’s delegation from Russia, a retaliation for the EU’s decision to expel Russian diplomats from Belgium earlier this month.  “As a response to the unfriendly actions of the European Union, 18 employees of the EU Delegation to Russia have been declared ‘persona non grata’ and will have to leave the territory of the Russian Federation in the near future,” reads a statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In response to the move, the EU said Friday it “deplores” Russia’s “unjustified, baseless decision” to remove its diplomats, calling the decision a “pure retaliatory step.” The EU on April 5 designated 19 Russian diplomats as personae non gratae for “engaging in activities contrary to their diplomatic status,” and ordered them to leave Belgium, where they were being hosted, according to Reuters. -Ella Lee Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his country's bravery late Thursday and said Ukraine should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the Russians “gave us a maximum of five.” In a video address, Zelenskyy called it “an achievement of millions of Ukrainians, of everyone who on Feb. 24 made the most important decision of their life – to fight.” He added: ""But they didn’t know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized European countries that continue to purchase Russian oil in an interview with the BBC.  “We don’t understand how you can make money out of blood,” Zelenskyy said. “Unfortunately, this is what some countries have been doing – European countries.” Zelenskyy called out Germany and Hungary in particular for not participating in the Russian oil embargo many other countries, including the U.S., have put in place. He added that while countries like the U.K. and U.S. have been helpful in providing weapons, Ukraine “needs them sooner and more of them.” “The priority word is ‘sooner,’” he said. “The priority word’s ‘quickly,’ the priority word’s ‘now.’ Because we are fighting now.” The BBC’s full interview with Zelenskyy will air April 16 on the BBC News Channel. Some 2.7 million people with disabilities are at ""grave risk of harm"" due to the war in Ukraine, the United Nations warned Friday. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said it received reports that people with disabilities, including children, are stranded in homes, residential care institutions and orphanages without necessary medication, food, water or other basic needs. Many have been separated from their support networks, making it more difficult to navigate their surroundings, the committee said.  The group also warned that women with disabilities are at a greater risk of sexual violence that has been reported across Ukraine.  The group called on Russia to “immediately” end the war and “observe and respect the principles of international human rights and humanitarian law.” Russia’s Defense Ministry on Friday promised to ramp up “the scale of missile attacks” on Kyiv in response to Ukraine’s “diversions on the Russian territory.” The statement comes a day after Russian authorities accused Ukrainian forces of launching airstrikes on residential buildings in one of the country’s regions on the border with Ukraine, in which seven people sustained injuries. According to Russian officials, some 100 residential buildings were damaged in Thursday’s attack on the Klimovo village in the Bryansk region. The Defense Ministry said that the Russian forces in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region shut down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter that was allegedly involved in the attack on the Bryansk region. Authorities in another border region, Belgorod, also reported Ukrainian shelling on Thursday. — Associated Press  Britain’s defense ministry says the loss of Russia’s naval flagship will likely force Moscow to change the way its naval forces operate in the Black Sea. The Moskva sank after being damaged in disputed circumstances. Ukraine says it struck the vessel with missiles, while Moscow acknowledged a fire on board but not any attack. In an update posted Friday on social media, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said the Soviet-era ship, which returned to operational service last year after a major refit, “served a key role as both a command vessel and air defence node.” It said the sinking “means Russia has now suffered damage to two key naval assets since invading Ukraine, the first being Russia’s Alligator-class landing ship Saratov on 24 March. Both events will likely lead Russia to review its maritime posture in the Black Sea.” The entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO would force Russia to strengthen its northwestern borders and place nuclear weapons in the region, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday. Medvedev noted on his Telegram channel that the length of Russia's land border with the NATO alliance would more than double. One of Russia's explanations for its invasion of Ukraine was concern over possible NATO expansion there. “Naturally, these borders will have to be strengthened. The grouping of ground forces and air defense will be seriously strengthened, and significant naval forces will be deployed in the waters of the Gulf of Finland,” Medvedev wrote, adding that keeping the region's non-nuclear status is ""out of the question.""

State officials have promised a full investigation. Meanwhile, protesters rallied this week in downtown Grand Rapids, calling for justice in his death.  During a press conference Thursday, the Lyoya family and their attorneys called on authorities to release the name of the officer, fire and prosecute him for the death of Lyoya.  The officer, who has not been publicly identified, was put on administrative leave, Grand Rapids Police Chief Eric Winstrom previously said.  ""I want to know the person who killed my son,"" said Patrick Lyoya's father, Peter, who also called for an arrest and conviction.

At the news conference Thursday, attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family, compared the treatment of Black people in the U.S. by police to what Russian soldiers are doing in Ukraine. The national civil rights attorney has previously represented the families of George Floyd, killed by Minneapolis police in May 2020, and Breonna Taylor, killed by Louisville, Kentucky, police in March 2020. “We are condemning Russian soldiers for shooting civilians in Ukraine in the back of the head,"" Crump said. ""Why aren’t we condemning police officers here in the United States of America shooting Black civilians in the back of the head? It's a simple question. If it's wrong in Ukraine ... it's wrong in Grand Rapids, Michigan.""

In the video, Lyoya and a passenger were pulled over by the unnamed officer for a traffic stop.

He ran around the car, the officer tackled him and they appeared to struggle over the officer's stun gun for about 90 seconds, Police Chief Eric Winstrom said.

The footage is a compilation of videos from a cellphone, a home security camera, a dashboard camera and the officer's body camera, which was deactivated during the struggle.

With Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic confirmation in the books, a new poll suggests a majority of Americans are uncertain whether it's worth all the fuss. Nearly seven in 10 Americans see the constitutionally mandated task of confirming a Supreme Court nominee as more about politics than substance, according to an exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos poll conducted after Jackson's confirmation. Only about 36% of people say the marathon of hearings leads to better justices on the high court. The skepticism appears to be shared across party identification: Fewer than half of both Republicans and Democrats think the hearings lead to better outcomes.  ""I think it's already decided who they're going to (vote for) before they even start talking to each other or interviewing each other,"" said Teresa Griesse, a 68-year-old business owner from Missouri who identifies as an independent. ""I believe it's politics. I don't believe it's a fair choice."" Jackie Johnson, a 74-year-old sales representative for the Georgia lottery who identifies as a Democrat, said the outcome depends on who's in office.  ""It's a two-sided thing. It's like a game of baseball: one side's gotta win,"" Johnson said. Hazing:Constitutional questions, cafeteria choices await Ketanji Brown Jackson  Diversity:Judge Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation ends idea of 'Black seat' Wait:Jackson confirmed in a hurry. Getting on the Supreme Court? That'll take time. If Americans are turned off by confirmation hearings, they appear to share the sentiment with the justices themselves, outside experts and even senior Senate aides – some of whom described them as ""kabuki theater"" and ""insufferable"" to a commission created by President Joe Biden last year to study the politicization of the Supreme Court. Public support for the Supreme Court has fallen in recent months as its 6-3 conservative majority takes up a series of culture war issues such as access to abortion, the availability of handguns and the constitutionality of affirmative action in college admissions. But some, including Chief Justice John Roberts, have warned that the exceedingly partisan confirmation process has played a role in harming the court's above-the-fray image. ""When you have a sharply political, divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,"" Roberts said in 2016. Jackson, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, was confirmed 53-47 on April 7 and will be sworn in as the 116th Supreme Court justice later this year. The Harvard-educated lawyer and Miami native will become the first Black woman to serve on the court in its 233-year history, a milestone even some of her critics acknowledged. Less than half – about four in ten Americans –  said Jackson was treated fairly at her hearings last month. The number rose to 55% for those who tuned in to watch.  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee peppered Jackson with questions about critical race theory, how often she attends church and how she would define the word ""woman."" She faced a barrage of questions about her judicial philosophy, her work as a federal public defender and her sentencing in criminal cases. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in particular, slammed Jackson on sentences she handed down for people convicted of possessing or distributing child pornography, which were frequently below guidelines set by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Jackson's supporters pointed to Sentencing Commission data that shows most federal judges issue sentences below the guidelines in child porn cases. Sentencing:A look at the child porn cases at issue in Jackson's Senate hearings Philosophy:After hearings, experts debate how Jackson would interpret Constitution It's not clear how much of that criticism cut through, particularly given the war raging in Ukraine, a recent jump in COVID-19 cases and the fact that Jackson's confirmation wouldn't upset the current 6-3 balance on the Supreme Court. Just under two-thirds of respondents said Jackson's ""judicial philosophy"" was a reason to oppose her – roughly the same as the share of people who cited her ""record on the vulnerable and children."" ""Judge, you gave him three months,"" Hawley, widely considered to be a possible GOP presidential candidate in 2024, pressed Jackson about one of the child pornography cases during the hearings. ""My question is, do you regret it – or not?"" ""Senator, what I regret is that in a hearing about my qualifications to be a justice on the Supreme Court, we have spent a lot of time focusing on this small subset of my sentences,"" Jackson responded at one point.  About two in 10 Americans said they watched some or all of the Senate confirmation hearings live, according to the poll. Roughly one-third said they learned about the hearings through news coverage. Nearly half said they didn't follow the hearings at all. Griesse said she watched ""very, very little"" of the hearings, while 29-year-old Jonathan White of New Jersey, who identifies as a Republican, said he watched all of it. ""She's overly qualified and they don't want to hear about it,"" White said of Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. No one – aside from perhaps Jackson herself – came out of the four-day series of hearings looking significantly better than before the gavel fell, the poll suggests. About 24% – including 41% of Republicans – said they had a more favorable impression of Hawley, Cruz and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., after the hearings. Senate Democrats fared only slightly better, with 30% saying they had a more favorable impression.  Those numbers were highly dependent on the party affiliation of the respondent.   By comparison, 40% of respondents said they had a more favorable view of Jackson after the hearings. Overall, 49% of Americans said they supported Jackson's confirmation – a number that rose to nearly two-thirds among those who said they followed the hearings. About 64% of Americans said it is significant there will soon be four women on the Supreme Court for the first time in its history: Jackson and Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett.  ""The significance of Jackson's confirmation, and all it represents, did not go unnoticed by the American public,"" said Cliff Young, president of the poll firm Ipsos. ""However, in our deeply partisan landscape, a strong majority see the nomination process as nothing more than politics as usual, and the hearing did little to change deeply-rooted attitudes about politics in America."" The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,005 Americans, taken April 12-13, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The Constitution requires that the Senate provide its ""advice and consent"" on presidential nominees to the Supreme Court, but it doesn't require hearings – and for most of the nation's history, senators didn't convene them. The first Supreme Court confirmation hearing was set in 1916 when President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, who would go on to be one of the court's most influential associate justices.  In modern times, both sides have alleged political shenanigans. Republicans point to President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in 1987, which Democrats torpedoed over his judicial philosophy. And they blame Democrats for the frenzy that surrounded the confirmation of Associate Justices Clarence Thomas in 1991 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Thomas faced allegations that he sexually harassed a former co-worker. Kavanaugh faced allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct. Both men denied the allegations during tense Senate hearings and were narrowly confirmed. Democrats note Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's 2016 nominee to the court, Merrick Garland, by arguing confirmations shouldn't take place months out from a presidential election. Four years later, after the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Republicans then rushed through President Donald Trump's nominee, Barrett, just weeks before the 2020 election. Today, with a few exceptions, the Senate confirmation process has tended to be more predictable, with nominees growing increasingly adept at not directly answering questions and final votes largely locked into place before the hearings begin. Jackson picked up three Republican votes – Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah.  In announcing her support for Jackson, Murkowski pointed in part to the judge's qualifications, which, she said, ""no one questions."" Johnson, the Georgia saleswoman, said Jackson's performance made her proud.  ""I don't know if I could've been that strong and stayed as calm as she did,"" she said."

For the latest on Ukraine, click here. Russian forces stepped up attacks on Saturday, with scattered strikes in Kyiv and western Ukraine in a reminder that no region is out-of-bounds despite Russia's pivot toward the east.  Russian troops struck a military target in Kyiv that killed one and injured several and shelled an oil refinery in Lysychansk that caught fire. After Russia's Black Sea flagship was sunk by Ukrainian missiles, Russia warned Friday there would be more attacks on the capital's military targets. The southern Mykolaiv region was battered Friday and Saturday. According to the presidential office, airstrikes Friday killed five and wounded 15. The head of the regional legislature, Hanna Zamazeyeva, also said Saturday that 39 people have been wounded in the past 24 hours. Zamazeyeva said the targets included several residential blocks “where there are no military facilities.” Ukraine’s presidential office reported Saturday that missile strikes and shelling over the past 24 hours occurred in eight regions: Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv in the east, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Kirovohrad in the central Ukraine and Mykolaiv and Kherson in the south.

KHARKIV, Ukraine — Russia’s bombardment of cities around Ukraine on Saturday included an explosion in Kharkiv that destroyed a community kitchen. Associated Press journalists at the scene recorded the immediate aftermath of the apparent missile attack. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said three people were killed and 34 wounded by missile strikes Saturday in that city alone. The kitchen was set up by World Central Kitchen, which is run by celebrity chef José Andrés to establish feeding systems in disaster and war zones. Andrés tweeted that the non-governmental organization’s staff members were shaken but safe. The organization says it has now reached 30 cities across the country, providing nearly 300,000 meals a day. Andrés said the attack in Kharkiv shows that “to give food in the middle of a senseless war is an act of courage, resilience and resistance” and that his group’s chefs will keep cooking for Ukraine. — Associated Press A Russian general whose troops have been besieging the Ukrainian port of Mariupol was buried on Saturday in St. Petersburg after dying in battle, the governor said. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Frolov was deputy commander of the 8th Army, which Russian media identified as being among the forces battering Mariupol for weeks. Gov. Alexander Beglov released a statement saying Frolov “died a heroic death in battle” without saying where or when he was killed. Photographs on Russian news websites showed his grave at a St. Petersburg cemetery piled high with red and white flowers. Ukraine has claimed that several Russian generals and dozens of other high-ranking officers have been killed during the war. At least seven other deaths of generals have been reported; Russia has not confirmed all of them. -The Associated Press A key strategic city in Ukraine has now endured more than six weeks of a brutal Russian siege, putting up a fierce resistance that has so far helped thwart Moscow's plans to control eastern Ukraine's industrial heartland.  But shortages of weapons and supplies are threatening Mariupol's ability to resist Russian forces. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday the fate of Mariupol will be key in determining whether negotiations can end the war.  “The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol – what they are doing now – can put an end to any format of negotiations,” Zelenskyy told The Associated Press. Once a city of 450,000, now only 120,000 people live there. At least 21,000 people have been killed in Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said. Bodies were “carpeted through the streets.”  The city was thrust into the international spotlight in early March with the bombing of a maternity hospital, an attack Western leaders have described as a war crime. The airstrike killed three civilians, including a child, and left 17 wounded. Russian cyberhackers are posing as the Security Service of Ukraine in hopes of tricking Ukrainians into downloading viruses, Ukraine’s information protection agency said Saturday.  The State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine said in a Telegram post that the bad actors are using popular messengers and asking users to download a file with instructions on “how to act during the wartime period,” but the file is a virus. The main targets of the attacks are civil servants, the agency said.  “The enemy does not stop trying to organize cyber attacks in Ukraine,” the agency said. “And although they are usually unsuccessful, each of us must pay attention to information security.” The information protection agency affirmed that the Security Service of Ukraine does not send out such messages and encouraged Ukrainians to think twice before engaging with similar messages.  - Ella Lee Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine’s richest man, is resolved to help rebuild the besieged city of Mariupol so it can again compete globally some day, he said in an interview with Reuters. The biggest company in Akhmetov’s financial and industrial holding company, System Capital Management, is the mining conglomerate Metinvest, which is headquartered in Mariupol. The steelmaker, which is the biggest in Ukraine, vowed Friday never to operate under Russian occupation.  ""My ambition is to return to a Ukrainian Mariupol and implement our (new production) plans so that Mariupol-produced steel can compete in global markets as before,"" Akhmetov told Reuters. Mariupol massacre:'Why? Why? Why?' Ukraine's Mariupol descends into despair He added that for Metinvest, the war started in 2014 when the company lost all its assets in Crimea and the temporarily occupied territory of Donbas. Still, that made the business “tougher and stronger,” he said. As Ukraine’s largest private business, Akhmetov is “confident” System Capital Management will play a key role in rebuilding Mariupol.   One person was killed and several wounded in a missile strike that hit Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, early Saturday, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a Telegram post. “Our anti-aircraft defense forces are doing everything possible to protect us, but the enemy is intruding and ruthless,” he said. “It is no secret that one of the Russian generals has been stating for days that they are ready for missile attacks on the capital of Ukraine. And as we can see, they are doing so.” In an earlier statement on Ukrainian television, Klitschko said numerous people were hospitalized and doctors are “fighting for their lives.” He encouraged Kyiv residents to refrain from returning to the city if possible. Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio said Friday that Italy’s ambassador to Kyiv is officially back in Ukraine’s capital. “It is the symbol of an Italy that wastes no time, never stops believing in diplomacy and persistently seeks peace,” Di Maio tweeted Friday. Italy’s embassy in Kyiv will reopen Monday and be “fully operational,” Di Maio added. The move comes after the European Union earlier this month resumed  its diplomatic presence in Kyiv after pulling out of the nation when Russia invaded in February, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and 12 other British officials are banned from entering Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Saturday, citing “unprecedented hostile actions” by Britain’s government. “The Russophobic course of the British authorities, whose main task is to stir up a negative attitude towards our country, curtail bilateral ties in almost all areas, is detrimental to the well-being and interests of the inhabitants of Britain itself,” reads the ministry’s statement. “Any sanctions attacks will inevitably hit their initiators and receive a decisive rebuff.” Russia’s foreign ministry claimed Britain is “deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine,” by providing Ukraine with weapons and coordinating with NATO and other Western allies to impose large-scale sanctions on Russia.  The ministry claimed additional British politicians who “contribute to whipping up anti-Russian hysteria” would soon be added to the list of banned individuals.  Amid the devastation of an invasion from Russia, Ukrainians also are trying to dodge COVID-19. Some 400 cases of COVID-19 are recorded daily in Ukraine, Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko said in an interview with Ukrainian television channel TCH. Lyashko explained that at the start of the war, about 4,000 cases were recorded daily. Numbers have continued to drop since then. Still, about 2,900 patients are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19, he said.  The health minister added that the scope of the nation’s COVID-19 statistics are limited by the ongoing war, noting that eastern regions of Ukraine are not reporting numbers, nor are they required to. An upcoming national holiday in Russia could be an important milestone in that country's invasion of Ukraine, a war that has been more difficult than the Kremlin anticipated. May 9 is Victory Day, marking the Russian defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 at the end of World War II. Officials in both Ukraine and the West see it as a date by which Russian President Vladimir Putin could target progress in the war. The date – marking the end of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War – is one that has gained significance in Putin's tenure ""and has become a foundational moment in the Kremlin’s politics of memory and Russian national identity,"" said Hannah Chapman, assistant professor of political science at Miami University. The Kremlin has staged massive shows of strength to mark the day, with parades and other displays of military might.  But not everyone agrees.

Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv’s regional police force, said the bodies had been abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. He cited police data indicating that 95% of the casualties had died from sniper fire and gunshot wounds. He added that more bodies were being found every day, under the rubble and in mass graves. “Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,” Nebytov said. “The number of killed civilians has surpassed 900 — and I emphasize, these are civilians, whose bodies we have discovered and handed over for forensic examination.” He added: “The most victims were found in Bucha, where there are more than 350 corpses.” According to Nebytov, utilities workers in Bucha had been gathering up and burying bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Nebytov added that Russian troops were “tracking down” people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views. Two Ukrainian Neptune missiles struck the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, which later sank, according to a senior U.S. Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Pentagon officials had previously said they could not confirm the Ukrainian claim, but they also did not refute it. The warship Moskva, which has a history that goes back to days of the Cold War, sank into the Black Sea on Thursday in the latest blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine.

Russian forces stepped up attacks on Saturday, with scattered strikes in Kyiv and western Ukraine in a reminder that no region is out-of-bounds despite Russia's pivot toward the east.  Russian troops struck a military target in Kyiv that killed one and injured several and shelled an oil refinery in Lysychansk that caught fire. After Russia's Black Sea flagship was sunk by Ukrainian missiles, Russia warned Friday there would be more attacks on the capital's military targets. The southern Mykolaiv region was battered Friday and Saturday. According to the presidential office, airstrikes Friday killed five and wounded 15. The head of the regional legislature, Hanna Zamazeyeva, also said Saturday that 39 people have been wounded in the past 24 hours. Zamazeyeva said the targets included several residential blocks “where there are no military facilities.” Ukraine’s presidential office reported Saturday that missile strikes and shelling over the past 24 hours occurred in eight regions: Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv in the east, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Kirovohrad in the central Ukraine and Mykolaiv and Kherson in the south.

Associated Press journalists at the scene recorded the immediate aftermath of the apparent missile attack. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said three people were killed and 34 wounded by missile strikes Saturday in that city alone. The kitchen was set up by World Central Kitchen, which is run by celebrity chef José Andrés to establish feeding systems in disaster and war zones. Andrés tweeted that the non-governmental organization’s staff members were shaken but safe. The organization says it has now reached 30 cities across the country, providing nearly 300,000 meals a day. Andrés said the attack in Kharkiv shows that “to give food in the middle of a senseless war is an act of courage, resilience and resistance” and that his group’s chefs will keep cooking for Ukraine. — Associated Press A Russian general whose troops have been besieging the Ukrainian port of Mariupol was buried on Saturday in St. Petersburg after dying in battle, the governor said. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Frolov was deputy commander of the 8th Army, which Russian media identified as being among the forces battering Mariupol for weeks. Gov.

""All over the world, all the countries have to be worried,"" Zelenskyy told CNN's ""State of the Union,"" highlighting a string of Easter Sunday interviews devoted mostly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskyy said he would welcome a visit to Ukraine by President Joe Biden and said he hopes the president will continue to provide aid to his embattled nation. The future of the war, he said, could hinge on how well Ukraine resists a new Russian offensive in the eastern part of his country. ""It can influence the course of the whole war,"" Zelenskyy told CNN, ""because I don't trust the Russian military and Russian leadership."" In that eastern region, Mariupol has not surrendered to the Russians, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Sunday. He spoke on ABC News' ""This Week"" hours after a Russian-set 6 a.m. deadline for surrender in the besieged city. Shmyhal said only Kherson had fallen to Russian control.  Zelenskyy said Saturday that the situation in Mariupol is ""inhuman"" after six weeks of holding out against relentless Russian forces.

Belgium, Estonia, and Bulgaria are barring all Russian ships from their ports beginning Sunday. Their announcement comes the same day as Italy's, as part of expanded EU sanctions announced earlier this month. Ships already in Italian ports must leave immediately “after completing their commercial activity,″ according to a notice sent to port authorities throughout the country. The bans apply to all Russian-flagged ships, including those that have changed their flag from Russia to any other nationality since Feb. 24, the date of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EU has imposed five rounds of sanctions against Russia, including the banning of ships in its fifth round. Leaders are still weighing a ban on Russian oil, with many European countries dependent on it.  – Celina Tebor WASHINGTON – Ukraine’s foreign minister is describing the situation in Mariupol as dire and heartbreaking and says Russia’s continued attacks there could be a “red line” that ends all efforts to reach peace through negotiation. Dmytro Kuleba tells CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the remaining Ukrainian military personnel and civilians in the port city are basically encircled by Russian forces.

The leader of the Anglican church said Easter is a time for peace and not “blood and iron.” Noting that in the Eastern Orthodox church followed by many in Russia and Ukraine Sunday marks the start of Holy Week – the week leading to Easter – he said ”let this be a time for Russian cease-fire, withdrawal and a commitment to talks.” VATICAN CITY – In an Easter Sunday message aimed at the world but heavily focused on Ukraine, Pope Francis raised two worries – the risk of nuclear warfare and that other armed conflicts on the globe will go unnoticed. In a speech from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, the pope quoted a declaration from scientists in the 1950s in which they posed the question: “Shall we put an end to the human race, or shall mankind renounce war?” The pope has repeatedly made anguished pleas for a cease-fire and negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. In his Easter message, Francis lamented that “so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing.” He expressed hope that the war in Europe will “also make us more concerned about other situations of conflict, suffering and sorrow” in situations “that we cannot overlook and do not want to forget.” Among the places he cited were Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. He singled out Yemen, suffering from a conflict “forgotten by all, with continuous victims.” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, the first EU leader to do so since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Nehammer, who visited Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of the Moscow trip, told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" in an interview broadcast on Sunday that it was a ""frank and tough"" conversation including discussion of ""war crimes"" Nehammer said he witnessed in Bucha, Ukraine. The Austrian leader related that Putin said he ""would cooperate with an international investigation, on one hand, and on the other hand, he told me that he doesn't trust the western world."" ""So it was a tough discussion between each other. But I tried to convince him that, for example, the former Yugoslavian war showed us that international investigation is useful to prosecute the war criminals,"" Nehammer said. Nehammer, who said his country is now home to 58,000 Ukrainian refugees, said Putin uses ""his own war logic"" but understands ""what is going on in Ukraine"" and ""believes he is winning the war."""

Ukrainians defend… [+4577 chars]","Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, April 17. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Monday, April 18, as Russia's invasion continues.  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Sunday that Russia's war on his country is far from over, and the world should be vigilant against the possible use of nuclear and chemical weapons by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ""All over the world, all the countries have to be worried,"" Zelenskyy told CNN's ""State of the Union,"" highlighting a string of Easter Sunday interviews devoted mostly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskyy said he would welcome a visit to Ukraine by President Joe Biden and said he hopes the president will continue to provide aid to his embattled nation. The future of the war, he said, could hinge on how well Ukraine resists a new Russian offensive in the eastern part of his country. ""It can influence the course of the whole war,"" Zelenskyy told CNN, ""because I don't trust the Russian military and Russian leadership."" In that eastern region, Mariupol has not surrendered to the Russians, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Sunday. He spoke on ABC News' ""This Week"" hours after a Russian-set 6 a.m. deadline for surrender in the besieged city. Shmyhal said only Kherson had fallen to Russian control.  Zelenskyy said Saturday that the situation in Mariupol is ""inhuman"" after six weeks of holding out against relentless Russian forces.

A visual guide to key military equipment and locations USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►Russia bombarded the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Sunday, destroying a community kitchen run by celebrity chef José Andrés. ►Russian forces shelled an oil refinery in the Ukrainian city of Lysychansk on Saturday, and a large fire erupted, a regional governor reported. ► U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and 12 other British officials are banned from entering Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Saturday, citing “unprecedented hostile actions” by Britain’s government. Belgium, Estonia, and Bulgaria are barring all Russian ships from their ports beginning Sunday. Their announcement comes the same day as Italy's, as part of expanded EU sanctions announced earlier this month. Ships already in Italian ports must leave immediately “after completing their commercial activity,″ according to a notice sent to port authorities throughout the country. The bans apply to all Russian-flagged ships, including those that have changed their flag from Russia to any other nationality since Feb. 24, the date of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EU has imposed five rounds of sanctions against Russia, including the banning of ships in its fifth round. Leaders are still weighing a ban on Russian oil, with many European countries dependent on it.  – Celina Tebor WASHINGTON – Ukraine’s foreign minister is describing the situation in Mariupol as dire and heartbreaking and says Russia’s continued attacks there could be a “red line” that ends all efforts to reach peace through negotiation.

He says the Ukrainians “continue their struggle” but that the city effectively doesn’t exist anymore because of massive destruction.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Monday, the 18th of April 2022. Today, the latest from Ukraine as we start a new week, plus a series of Easter weekend shootings, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Explosions apparently caused by missiles hit the western Ukraine city of Lviv earlier today. The city has been spared some of the war's worst in Ukraine, but has not been completely immune. And at least six people were killed there in today's violence. Meanwhile, Russia's focused offensive in Ukraine's east is largely centered right now on taking control of the port city of Mariupol. But a few thousand fighters are holding on to a massive steel mill there, the city's last pocket of resistance. Capturing Mariupol would be a massive victory for Russia, securing a land corridor to the Crimean peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia has relentlessly shelled the city throughout its invasion, and Ukrainian authorities estimate more than 21,000 people have been killed there. Russia has gone after civilians, hitting a maternity hospital, and a theater where civilians had taken shelter. Russia has continued to shell Kharkiv as well, Ukraine's second biggest city. One woman covered in blood, Valentina Ulyanova, said this. Taylor Wilson translating for Valentina Ulyanova: ""All windows, all furniture, all destroyed. And door, too."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told ABC News yesterday that Ukraine is prepared to end the war through diplomacy if possible, but does not have intention to surrender. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with Russian president Vladimir Putin this past week in a first by a European leader since the invasion began in February. He said Putin is in his own war logic on Ukraine. Authorities in both South Carolina and Pittsburgh are still searching for answers after a series of mass shootings over the weekend. In Pittsburgh, two people were killed and eight injured after gunfire at a house party early Sunday morning. In Columbia, South Carolina, 14 people were injured when gunfire broke out inside a crowded mall. Police chief Skip Holbrook. Skip Holbrook: We have three people detained. What we know is at least three people were seen with firearms inside the mall, and at least one person fired a weapon. That could change. This is still early. We don't believe this was random. I think that's very important in situations like this. We believe that the individuals that were armed knew each other, and there was some type of conflict that occurred that resulted in gunfire. This was not a situation where we had some random person show up at a mall to discharge a firearm and just injure people. And another nine people were injured at a shooting in a nightclub in Hampton County, South Carolina. Tax day is here. If you've been procrastinating, today's the last day to submit your federal taxes. Or you can file for an extension, but you'll have to also do that by today. Americans had an extra weekend to prepare their returns because of the observance of Emancipation Day in Washington DC on April 15th. And residents in Massachusetts and Maine have an extra day through April 19th because of the Patriots' Day holiday in those states. Still, tax season is ending the earliest it has since 2019.

Then at 8:30, the Utah Jazz will try to do the same in Dallas against the Mavericks on NBA TV. The Mavs may again be without star Luka Dončić. That's followed by the Golden State Warriors up a game on the Denver Nuggets at 10:00 Eastern on TNT. The action follows an eventful opening weekend that saw the Minnesota Timberwolves shock the Memphis Grizzlies on their floor, and the Boston Celtics won on a last second buzzer beater over the Brooklyn Nets in Game One. The Nets' Kyrie Irving also gave double middle fingers to a heckling Boston crowd at one point. Irving for much of the season was not allowed to play home games because he refused to get vaccinated for COVID-19. For more coverage all playoffs long, stay with USA TODAY Sports. The Boston Marathon is back today. Its 126th running comes just six months after the 2021 race, which was postponed until October because of the pandemic.

Now, that possibility is all but certain, Cy… [+3350 chars]","Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Monday, April 18. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Tuesday, April 19, as Russia's invasion continues.  Russia has launched its long-foreshadowed offensive in eastern Ukraine offensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Monday, vowing that his people will continue to fight and ""defend ourselves.""  “Now we can already state that the Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,” Zelenskyy announced Monday in a video address, stating that a significant portion of the Kremlin's army was concentrated in the effort.  He added: “No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” In recent days, Russia has reinforced its invading force in Ukraine, adding about 11 battalion tactical groups and as many as 11,000 troops, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Monday. Russian forces on Monday increased assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. “The occupiers attempted to break through our defenses,” said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council. “Fortunately, our military is holding out. They passed through only two cities — this is Kreminna and another small town.” A Ukrainian military official said street battles have begun and evacuation is impossible in the town of Kreminna. That’s one of only two spots where the Ukrainians said the Russians managed to break through on Monday along a front stretching for hundreds of miles. Luhansk regional military administrator Serhiy Haidai said the town came under heavy artillery overnight, setting seven residential buildings on fire, and that the Olympus sports complex where the nation’s Olympic team trains was targeted. Haidai later said on Ukrainian TV that Russians took control of the city after “leveling everything to the ground,” so his guys retreated to regroup and keep on fighting. “It simply makes no sense to stand in one place, to die for everyone, without causing significant damage to the enemy,” he said. RUSSIA'S ARSENAL: What weapons are being used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine? A visual guide to key military equipment and locations USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►Germany’s employers and unions joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. They say a boycott would lead to factory shutdowns and job losses in the bloc’s largest economy. ►Ukraine took another step in its bid for European Union membership, completing a questionnaire that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen handed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month. ►For a second day, Ukraine's government halted civilian evacuations. Government officials said Russian forces were targeting humanitarian corridors with shelling and blocking routes. ►Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Monday that the city risks losing about 200,000 jobs as foreign companies leave the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, dismissed the impact of Western sanctions, saying his country ""has withstood the unprecedented pressure."" ►Russia is creating separatist states and introducing the Russian ruble in occupied parts of Ukraine's Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. ►The Russian military forcibly removed over 100 children from Mariupol, many taken from hospitals without parents, the Crimean Human Rights Group reported, citing Mariupol's mayoral adviser Petro Andryushchenko. Russian forces have started dropping bunker-buster bombs on a Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainians are refusing to surrender, the commander of the Azov Regiment of the National Guard said Monday. Denys Prokopenko, whose soldiers have been holding out against Russian forces in the key southern port city, said in a video message that the bombs are dropping even though civilians are sheltering in the plant’s tunnels. Russia estimated that 2,500 Ukrainian troops and about 400 foreign mercenaries were dug in. The U.S. said nearly a dozen Russian battalion tactical groups have been tied up trying to defeat them. Along with the soldiers about 1,000 civilians are also inside the Azovstal steel plant. Reports from CNN and Reuters say Russian forces have been advancing on the plant and fights have broken out on the streets surrounding it.  Those sheltering include women, children and elderly, Myhailo Vershynin, the chief of the Mariupol patrol police, told CNN. He added while the plant had reserves of food and water, supplies were quickly running out.  Russia moved more heavy artillery, helicopters and command and control units into the region ahead of launching its offensive in eastern Ukraine as heavy fighting continued, including near the strategic city of Izyum, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Monday. In all, there about 76 Russian battalion tactical groups in Ukraine. About 12 of those battalions are engaged in heavy fighting around the besieged Black Sea port city of Mariupol, which remains contested and isolated from other Ukrainian forces, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe intelligence assessments.  Moscow said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles, while its artillery hit an additional 315 targets and its warplanes conducted 108 strikes. The claims could not be independently verified. Russian bombers have also launched long-range cruise missiles at Kyiv and Lviv, the official said. The targets appeared to be military facilities, but the regional governor in Lviv said at least seven people were killed and 11 more, including a child, were injured. ""Many of the Russian strikes we've seen in recent days have targeted military installations, military adjacent installations,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a Monday news conference. ""But the fact is that Russia, more than just launching an invasion, more than just launching a war, is undertaking a campaign of terror, a campaign of brutality, a campaign of despicable aggression against the people of Ukraine.” Airstrikes by Russia's military killed at least seven people and injured 11 more – including one child – early Monday in Lviv in western Ukraine, the regional governor said. The deaths in Lviv were confirmed by regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy. He said four rockets were fired, striking three targets including several warehouses not used by Ukraine's military and a service station near Lviv Railway Station. The deaths were the first to be reported in the city since Russia's assault on Ukraine started in late February. On March 13, Russia fired 30 cruise missiles at the Yavoriv military training base, outside the city of Lviv, killing at least 35 people and wounding 134. Overnight blasts were also reported in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, in the north in Kharkiv and in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea port city Odesa. Kozytskyy said a preliminary investigation indicated the rockets that hit Lviv were fired from the direction of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water that links Asia and Europe. An ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin currently being held by Ukrainian authorities on a treason charge offered himself in exchange for the evacuation of civilians in the besieged city of Mariupol. Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party in Ukraine, made the plea in a video posted Monday by Ukraine’s state security service, who captured Medvedchuk last week in a special operation. Medvedchuk, 67, escaped from house arrest shorty before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began earlier this year. Medvedchuk appealed to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the video. Shortly after the video was published, two British men who surrendered to Russian forces in Mariupol also pleaded for their release. The men identified themselves as Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin in the videos posted by Russian state media. Fighting continued to rage Monday in eastern Ukrainian cities as Russian forces sought to make advances the the Luhansk region, Ukrainian officials said. Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, said Monday that the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna were ""under the greatest threat"" and that the city of Kreminna had been captured, according to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform. In nearby Zolote, at least two people were killed and four others injured in a strike, Haidai said, according to Ukrinform on Sunday. Meanwhile, a Russian strike on Kramatorsk destroyed several residential buildings Monday, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional state administrator in Donetsk, said via Telegram. Farther west, Ukrainian forces were able to push back Russian troops and liberate several settlements around the city of Izyum, said Alexander Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine's Defense Ministry, Ukrinform reported. But the city of Kharkiv was hit in a Russian strike, killing at least three people and wounded three others, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. The British Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update Monday that Ukrainian forces' defense of the besieged city of Mariupol ""has severely tested Russian forces."" Russia has had to divert troops and supplies to Mariupol, in turn slowing its advances elsewhere, the U.K. assessment said, adding, ""Russian commanders will be concerned by the time it is taking to subdue Mariupol."" Ukrainian forces are largely holed up in the Azovstal steel mill as the city has been decimated over several weeks of Russia's attacks. Ukrainian officials have said its troops will not surrender, and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Russia's continued attacks could be a “red line” that ends efforts to reach peace through negotiation.  White House officials have repeatedly warned that evolving intelligence suggests Russia may be exploring potential cyberattacks against the United States. Now, that possibility is all but certain, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said Sunday. ""We have to assume that there's going to be a breach,"" Easterly said on ""60 Minutes."" ""There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack."" Russia is known to have powerful cyber actors. U.S. intelligence agencies and federal prosecutors have concluded that the Russian government sought to sway the 2016 presidential election. Recently, Microsoft said it disrupted Russian cyberattacks targeting Ukraine, the U.S., and European Union.  Lisa Monaco, U.S. Deputy Attorney General, told Bill Whitaker on ""60 Minutes"" that Russian state actors are already looking for weaknesses in U.S. cybersecurity and infrastructure.

We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” In recent days, Russia has reinforced its invading force in Ukraine, adding about 11 battalion tactical groups and as many as 11,000 troops, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Monday. Russian forces on Monday increased assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. “The occupiers attempted to break through our defenses,” said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council. “Fortunately, our military is holding out. They passed through only two cities — this is Kreminna and another small town.” A Ukrainian military official said street battles have begun and evacuation is impossible in the town of Kreminna. That’s one of only two spots where the Ukrainians said the Russians managed to break through on Monday along a front stretching for hundreds of miles. Luhansk regional military administrator Serhiy Haidai said the town came under heavy artillery overnight, setting seven residential buildings on fire, and that the Olympus sports complex where the nation’s Olympic team trains was targeted. Haidai later said on Ukrainian TV that Russians took control of the city after “leveling everything to the ground,” so his guys retreated to regroup and keep on fighting. “It simply makes no sense to stand in one place, to die for everyone, without causing significant damage to the enemy,” he said. RUSSIA'S ARSENAL: What weapons are being used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine? A visual guide to key military equipment and locations USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►Germany’s employers and unions joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. They say a boycott would lead to factory shutdowns and job losses in the bloc’s largest economy. ►Ukraine took another step in its bid for European Union membership, completing a questionnaire that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen handed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month. ►For a second day, Ukraine's government halted civilian evacuations. Government officials said Russian forces were targeting humanitarian corridors with shelling and blocking routes. ►Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Monday that the city risks losing about 200,000 jobs as foreign companies leave the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, dismissed the impact of Western sanctions, saying his country ""has withstood the unprecedented pressure."" ►Russia is creating separatist states and introducing the Russian ruble in occupied parts of Ukraine's Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. ►The Russian military forcibly removed over 100 children from Mariupol, many taken from hospitals without parents, the Crimean Human Rights Group reported, citing Mariupol's mayoral adviser Petro Andryushchenko. Russian forces have started dropping bunker-buster bombs on a Mariupol steel plant where Ukrainians are refusing to surrender, the commander of the Azov Regiment of the National Guard said Monday. Denys Prokopenko, whose soldiers have been holding out against Russian forces in the key southern port city, said in a video message that the bombs are dropping even though civilians are sheltering in the plant’s tunnels. Russia estimated that 2,500 Ukrainian troops and about 400 foreign mercenaries were dug in. The U.S. said nearly a dozen Russian battalion tactical groups have been tied up trying to defeat them. Along with the soldiers about 1,000 civilians are also inside the Azovstal steel plant. Reports from CNN and Reuters say Russian forces have been advancing on the plant and fights have broken out on the streets surrounding it.  Those sheltering include women, children and elderly, Myhailo Vershynin, the chief of the Mariupol patrol police, told CNN. He added while the plant had reserves of food and water, supplies were quickly running out.  Russia moved more heavy artillery, helicopters and command and control units into the region ahead of launching its offensive in eastern Ukraine as heavy fighting continued, including near the strategic city of Izyum, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Monday. In all, there about 76 Russian battalion tactical groups in Ukraine. About 12 of those battalions are engaged in heavy fighting around the besieged Black Sea port city of Mariupol, which remains contested and isolated from other Ukrainian forces, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe intelligence assessments.  Moscow said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles, while its artillery hit an additional 315 targets and its warplanes conducted 108 strikes. The claims could not be independently verified. Russian bombers have also launched long-range cruise missiles at Kyiv and Lviv, the official said. The targets appeared to be military facilities, but the regional governor in Lviv said at least seven people were killed and 11 more, including a child, were injured. ""Many of the Russian strikes we've seen in recent days have targeted military installations, military adjacent installations,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a Monday news conference. ""But the fact is that Russia, more than just launching an invasion, more than just launching a war, is undertaking a campaign of terror, a campaign of brutality, a campaign of despicable aggression against the people of Ukraine.” Airstrikes by Russia's military killed at least seven people and injured 11 more – including one child – early Monday in Lviv in western Ukraine, the regional governor said. The deaths in Lviv were confirmed by regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy. He said four rockets were fired, striking three targets including several warehouses not used by Ukraine's military and a service station near Lviv Railway Station. The deaths were the first to be reported in the city since Russia's assault on Ukraine started in late February. On March 13, Russia fired 30 cruise missiles at the Yavoriv military training base, outside the city of Lviv, killing at least 35 people and wounding 134. Overnight blasts were also reported in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, in the north in Kharkiv and in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea port city Odesa. Kozytskyy said a preliminary investigation indicated the rockets that hit Lviv were fired from the direction of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water that links Asia and Europe. An ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin currently being held by Ukrainian authorities on a treason charge offered himself in exchange for the evacuation of civilians in the besieged city of Mariupol. Viktor Medvedchuk, the former leader of a pro-Russian opposition party in Ukraine, made the plea in a video posted Monday by Ukraine’s state security service, who captured Medvedchuk last week in a special operation. Medvedchuk, 67, escaped from house arrest shorty before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began earlier this year. Medvedchuk appealed to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the video. Shortly after the video was published, two British men who surrendered to Russian forces in Mariupol also pleaded for their release. The men identified themselves as Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin in the videos posted by Russian state media. Fighting continued to rage Monday in eastern Ukrainian cities as Russian forces sought to make advances the the Luhansk region, Ukrainian officials said. Serhiy Haidai, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, said Monday that the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna were ""under the greatest threat"" and that the city of Kreminna had been captured, according to Ukrainian state media Ukrinform. In nearby Zolote, at least two people were killed and four others injured in a strike, Haidai said, according to Ukrinform on Sunday. Meanwhile, a Russian strike on Kramatorsk destroyed several residential buildings Monday, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional state administrator in Donetsk, said via Telegram. Farther west, Ukrainian forces were able to push back Russian troops and liberate several settlements around the city of Izyum, said Alexander Motuzyanyk, spokesman for Ukraine's Defense Ministry, Ukrinform reported. But the city of Kharkiv was hit in a Russian strike, killing at least three people and wounded three others, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. The British Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update Monday that Ukrainian forces' defense of the besieged city of Mariupol ""has severely tested Russian forces."" Russia has had to divert troops and supplies to Mariupol, in turn slowing its advances elsewhere, the U.K. assessment said, adding, ""Russian commanders will be concerned by the time it is taking to subdue Mariupol."" Ukrainian forces are largely holed up in the Azovstal steel mill as the city has been decimated over several weeks of Russia's attacks. Ukrainian officials have said its troops will not surrender, and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Russia's continued attacks could be a “red line” that ends efforts to reach peace through negotiation.  White House officials have repeatedly warned that evolving intelligence suggests Russia may be exploring potential cyberattacks against the United States. Now, that possibility is all but certain, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said Sunday. ""We have to assume that there's going to be a breach,"" Easterly said on ""60 Minutes."" ""There's going to be an incident. There's going to be an attack."" Russia is known to have powerful cyber actors. U.S. intelligence agencies and federal prosecutors have concluded that the Russian government sought to sway the 2016 presidential election. Recently, Microsoft said it disrupted Russian cyberattacks targeting Ukraine, the U.S., and European Union.  Lisa Monaco, U.S. Deputy Attorney General, told Bill Whitaker on ""60 Minutes"" that Russian state actors are already looking for weaknesses in U.S. cybersecurity and infrastructure. ""We're talking military intelligence actors, deploying malware, malicious code, on thousands of computers in hundreds of countries,"" Monaco said Sunday. ""We're seeing them deploy that code and take control of these computers. It's like an army of infected computers that, with a single command, can be deployed to do everything from gathering information, stealing information, and sometimes to have destructive effect."" In his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian troops in southern Ukraine have been carrying out torture and kidnappings. “Torture chambers are built there,” he said. “They abduct representatives of local governments and anyone deemed visible to local communities.” Russia has come under increasing scrutiny as mounting evidence builds of military attacks against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine, leading U.S. President Joe Biden to call Putin's actions ""genocide.""  “This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians,” Zelenskyy said.  Belgium, Estonia, and Bulgaria barred all Russian ships from their ports beginning Sunday.

After wrapping up this weekend, Coachella will return April 22 through 24.  What'd you miss so far? Staffers from The Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, were at the Empire Polo Club this weekend and most had never been the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival before. But whether you're a newbie or this is your 10th time at the event, it's hard to deny that these moments were made for the Coachella history books.  More:Billie Eilish insists she shouldn't headline Coachella, then delivers powerful, polished set Who doesn't love to watch a wild fan test their luck against security guards (but only when nobody is harmed in the process, of course)? Disclosure's 7:10 p.m. set drew one of the biggest crowds Saturday, but one attendee in particular wanted to get up close.  A man dressed in a purple shirt confidently strolled past two security guards into the photo pit directly in front of the stage, an area which requires specific credentials. He was quickly ushered back out, but he was just getting started. With the same two security guards blocking the area, the man got on his belly and did an army crawl into the legs and feet of the security guards, who looked on in disbelief. Remarkably, it worked. He had leverage on the two security guards and he squirted past them. They caught up with him 15 feet later and yanked him back outside the photo pit.  He did it again, successfully getting through and running toward the front of the stage until he was tackled to the ground — but not before one of the security guards got a selfie. — Shad Powers They found love in a hopeless place: the dusty fields of the Empire Polo Grounds. Lily and Jeronie Alcantara met through friends at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012. This week, 10 years, later, they returned to the desert after tying the knot in Las Vegas on April 13. “The first day, he’s like, ‘Hey, who are you trying to see? You can be my Coachella girlfriend for the weekend,’ and then the weekend became 10 years,” Lily recalled Sunday from her group’s tent near the festival entrance.  The couple, who live in San Diego, came to the site with some friends around 3 a.m. Thursday to secure their front-line spot.  Given their breakneck week of events — they came straight from Las Vegas to Indio to get their spot — the couple hadn’t even gotten a chance to cut into a wedding cake until Sunday, before heading onto the grounds for Day 3 of the festival. — Tom Coulter The Desert Sun successfully predicted several special guests at Coachella Weekend 1, but one that none of us saw coming was Shania Twain. During his Friday night headlining set, Harry Styles pretended to act confused when the opening chords of ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman!"" played behind him. To everyone's surprise, Shania Twain herself suddenly appeared in a dress almost as shiny as Styles' to sing her hit song with him.  After their duet, the pair hugged and shared a touching moment when Styles thanked her for being the soundtrack to several memories between Styles and his mother.  ""In the car, with my mother as a child, this lady taught me to sing,"" said Styles. ""She also told me that men are trash. To you, for the memories you gave me with my mother, I will be forever grateful,"" he said. — Niki Kottmann Coachella 2022: Harry Styles dazzles in festival debut, Shania Twain joins on stage Late afternoon on Sunday, a helicopter flew over the festival grounds pulling a banner with the following message: “Kanye was busy minting Catalina whales.” What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours. No seriously, please tell us what it means because this left several Desert Sun reporters scratching our heads while googling “Kanye Catalina whales.” It seems to maybe have something to do with “NFTs” and “blockchains,” but as a group of local news and arts reporters our knowledge of these terms is nonexistent. The Catalina Whale Mixer “is a Web3 global entertainment franchise, created with you and for you,” according to its website.  “The Catalina Whale Mixer was created for all Whales; in life, in business, and in culture. It was created for those who refuse to live within the limitations others set for you, who take risks, work hard, party hard, and live life to the fullest,” states the website.  Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, was originally set to headline on Sunday night, but pulled out less than two weeks before the festival. Ye was replaced with Swedish House Mafia and The Weeknd. — Erin Rode There are plenty of contenders for the most memorable outfit at Coachella, but if you look at the wide range of musical acts that played during Weekend 1, none stuck out more than the band Surf Curse, whose members wore the outfits of Dorothy and her companions from “The Wizard of Oz.” Despite the afternoon heat, singer and drummer Nick Rattigan donned a lion costume throughout the set — “The worst thing is the mane,” he quipped — and eventually launched himself into the crowd by announcing “the lion is coming into the den.” We’ll see if the members of Surf Curse wear the same outfits or opt for something that better withstands the heat during Weekend 2. — Tom Coulter During Run the Jewels' Sunday set, Killer Mike referenced Richard B.

A close-up of Russian president Vladimir Putin's eyes interjected the sad imagery, during and after which lead singer Damiano David yelled an expletive directed at the politician.  Although the K-pop group 2NE1 wouldn't be known to many who aren't fans of the genre, it was a Big Deal that the band reunited Saturday — for the first time since 2015 — for a performance during 88rising's set.

Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks The post generated close to 12,000 interactions and close to 600 shares in less than a week. Similar posts have amassed hundreds of interactions on Facebook and Twitter. But the claim is false. While there has been an inflation spike in 2021 and 2022, it's not as high as the post claims.  USA TODAY reached out to Eric Trump and social media users who shared the claim for comment. The most well-known measure of inflation is the consumer price index (CPI) calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, according to the Brookings Institution.  The index tracks the change in the cost of a ""basket"" of 80,000 goods typical consumers purchases each month, William Hauk, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina, told USA TODAY in an email. Inflation occurs when this basket becomes more expensive over time. Inflation is calculated on a monthly basis, but annual inflation can be calculated by either averaging the inflation for each month or examining only the December figure reported at the end of each year. Based on CPI figures, those calculations show the following percentage change year over year: Inflation - monthly average Inflation - December of each year Neither approach generates figures in line with Eric Trump's Facebook post. There is also little chance the inflation rate rises to 14% in the near future, Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo, told USA TODAY. ""At 8.5%, March is likely to mark the peak in inflation this cycle,"" House said. ""The level of prices is very likely to continue to rise throughout this year, but the pace is expected to moderate as consumer spending slows."" Though the post significantly overstates the increase, inflation has indeed jumped in 2021 and 2022. A combination of monetary and fiscal policies designed to speed economic recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the spike, Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University, told USA TODAY in an email. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero, which has made it easier for people to borrow money, Furman said. The 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security package and the 2021 American Rescue Plan sent checks to households to help combat pandemic-related unemployment.  With these measures staving off a recession, consumer spending and demand – which was pent-up during the pandemic –  increased and drove up prices. Fact check: Baseless NESARA conspiracy theory resurfaces online ""The effects probably weren’t seen that much in 2020 inflation because, during the height of the pandemic, unemployment rates were high and consumers were largely staying home, so the money was either replacing lost income or people weren’t able to spend much of it,"" Hauk said.  Supply chains in certain areas have been unable to keep up with the rising consumer demand and shortage of labor, which has also pushed prices higher. Flexport, a company that arranges shipments, told USA TODAY last month that delivery time from Asian factories to West Coast ports is about 110 days, which is an increase of 40 to 50 days compared to before the pandemic. More recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to disruptions in the food market and increased oil prices, which account for a large fraction of inflation, Hauk said. ""Combine all these factors together, and you have a recipe for higher prices,"" Hauk said. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that an image shows inflation rates from 2017 to 2022. The inflation rates listed in the post are not accurate. Inflation has spiked amid the pandemic recovery and ongoing supply chain issues, but it has only reached about half the level claimed in the post.  Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Check out the 5 Things podcast:  The federal government said Monday passengers traveling on airplanes and other forms of public transportation won't be required to wear a face mask for now after a federal judge in Florida ruled the federal mask mandate exceeded the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which failed to justify the order and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures. A Biden administration official said the ruling means that, for now, the mask mandate is not in effect. The Transportation Security Administration said it won't enforce it. The official noted the CDC recommends people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings to fight the spread of COVID. A consequence of the decision is it has created a confusing patchwork of rules for passengers as they navigate airports and transit systems on Tuesday and going forward. Major airlines have dropped the mask requirement. Airports weren't as fast to do away with masks, with several expressing uncertainty about the ruling and taking a wait-and-see approach.  President Joe Biden is traveling to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Tuesday to discuss how investments in infrastructure will improve the country's ports and waterways. The president is expected to highlight how these investments will strengthen supply chains and keep goods moving to help lower prices. Biden's visit comes as Americans continue to face record-high gas prices and rising inflation rates. The soaring gas prices, climbing before the war in Ukraine but skyrocketing since, have underscored the challenge of transitioning the nation toward clean and renewable energy — a key part of Biden’s economic agenda. Biden has responded to the recent spike in gas prices by tapping into the nation's oil reserves, pushing the U.S. petroleum industry to boost production and courting despotic nations abroad for more oil to compensate for a ban on Russian energy imports he imposed. Lawyers for the family of Patrick Lyoya, an unarmed Black man killed by police in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said they will release results from an independent autopsy Tuesday. Details emerged last week about Lyoya after police released video of the fatal traffic stop, which occurred April 4. It shows Lyoya was shot by a white police officer after a struggle. Despite the Lyoya family asking for police to release the name of the officer, the department has not done so and no charges have been issued. The official autopsy report is being shared with state police and won't immediately be released to the public. But a separate autopsy was performed by Dr. Werner Spitz, a 95-year-old forensic pathologist who worked on investigations following the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., among other high-profile cases. One of the lawyers representing Lyoya's family is Ben Crump, who represented the families of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many others. A winter storm is expected to make weather in the Northeast feel more like February than April on Tuesday. Heavy, accumulating snow is forecast to spread across portions of the region through Tuesday, Accuweather said. The snow is likely to cause travel disruptions, particularly in the mountains from West Virginia to northwestern New England, the forecaster added. Many areas are projected to see 6-12 inches of snow, and some spots could see as much as 2 feet, AccuWeather said. Snowfall rates of 2-3 inches per hour are possible. Closer to the coast, heavy rain and howling winds will dominate the weather headlines. Cities from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine, are at risk of a period of urban flooding, AccuWeather said.  Contributing: The Associated Press"

A Biden administration official said the ruling means that, for now, the mask mandate is not in effect. The Transportation Security Administration said it won't enforce it. The official noted the CDC recommends people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings to fight the spread of COVID. A consequence of the decision is it has created a confusing patchwork of rules for passengers as they navigate airports and transit systems on Tuesday and going forward. Major airlines have dropped the mask requirement. Airports weren't as fast to do away with masks, with several expressing uncertainty about the ruling and taking a wait-and-see approach.  President Joe Biden is traveling to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Tuesday to discuss how investments in infrastructure will improve the country's ports and waterways. The president is expected to highlight how these investments will strengthen supply chains and keep goods moving to help lower prices. Biden's visit comes as Americans continue to face record-high gas prices and rising inflation rates. The soaring gas prices, climbing before the war in Ukraine but skyrocketing since, have underscored the challenge of transitioning the nation toward clean and renewable energy — a key part of Biden’s economic agenda. Biden has responded to the recent spike in gas prices by tapping into the nation's oil reserves, pushing the U.S. petroleum industry to boost production and courting despotic nations abroad for more oil to compensate for a ban on Russian energy imports he imposed. Lawyers for the family of Patrick Lyoya, an unarmed Black man killed by police in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said they will release results from an independent autopsy Tuesday. Details emerged last week about Lyoya after police released video of the fatal traffic stop, which occurred April 4. It shows Lyoya was shot by a white police officer after a struggle. Despite the Lyoya family asking for police to release the name of the officer, the department has not done so and no charges have been issued. The official autopsy report is being shared with state police and won't immediately be released to the public. But a separate autopsy was performed by Dr. Werner Spitz, a 95-year-old forensic pathologist who worked on investigations following the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., among other high-profile cases. One of the lawyers representing Lyoya's family is Ben Crump, who represented the families of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many others. A winter storm is expected to make weather in the Northeast feel more like February than April on Tuesday. Heavy, accumulating snow is forecast to spread across portions of the region through Tuesday, Accuweather said. The snow is likely to cause travel disruptions, particularly in the mountains from West Virginia to northwestern New England, the forecaster added. Many areas are projected to see 6-12 inches of snow, and some spots could see as much as 2 feet, AccuWeather said. Snowfall rates of 2-3 inches per hour are possible. Closer to the coast, heavy rain and howling winds will dominate the weather headlines. Cities from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine, are at risk of a period of urban flooding, AccuWeather said.  Contributing: The Associated Press"

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 19th of April 2022. Today, the Donbas offensive, plus no more mask mandates on planes, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ Russian forces attacked today along a broad front in Eastern Ukraine. It appears that a long anticipated new offensive in Ukraine's Donbas region is here. Ukraine's general staff said in a statement, ""The occupiers made an attempt to break through our defenses along nearly the entire front line."" Moscow backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years. In the mostly Russian speaking Donbas, they've declared two independent republics, Donetsk and Luhansk, that have been recognized by Russia. And Russia has declared the capture of the Donbas to be its main goal in the war after attempts to take the capital of Kyiv failed. US military officials say Russia has added artillery and ground combat forces in the region. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. John Kirby: I mean, we have seen the Russians continue to flow in enablers, capabilities that will help them fight in the Donbas going forward. That's artillery, rotary aviation, helicopter support, command and control enablers. And we do believe that they have reinforced the number of battalion tactical groups in the east and the south of Ukraine. Now, we can't say specifically where all these battalions, these tactical groups are going, but we have seen over the last few days that they've added now more than 10 to what they already had there in that part of the country. Separate and distinct from that, Bob, we have continued to see the concentration of their airstrikes and artillery in the Donbas and in the south, particularly around and in Mariupol. That's where the preponderance of their strike activity has gone. And the fighting in Mariupol, as you guys have all seen, continues. The Ukrainians are still resisting. The city has not fallen to the Russians, but they continue to pound it from the air and through long range fires. Russia has confidence that years of separatist movements in the region will help them get lots of local support in the fights to come. But Ukrainian soldiers waiting for Russian forces are confident. Taylor Wilson translating for a Russian soldier: ""As I said back in 2016, if they step on our territory, let them come in. They will stay here forever. There is enough land for everyone to be buried. Even if they just walk in one or one and a half meters, there won't be questions. They will get what they deserve."" Russia gained control of the city of Kreminna yesterday, bringing them closer to the city of Slovyansk. It's seen as a major target of the Russian offensive. Slovyansk was taken by pro-Russian fighters in 2014 before Ukrainian forces retook it months later. Airlines are ditching their face mask rules for the first time in two years. Delta, United, American, Southwest and other airlines announced yesterday that they're dropping face mask requirements immediately. The move comes after a federal judge in Florida voided a CDC mandate. It was announced in January of 2021 and set to expire yesterday, though the CDC said it would extend the mandate an additional 15 days, marking the mask mandate's fifth extension. But the Biden White House said the Florida ruling means that for now the mask mandate is not in effect. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. Jen Psaki: CDC recommended continuing the order for additional time, two weeks, to be able to assess the latest science in keeping with its responsibility to protect the American people. So this is obviously a disappointing decision. The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask in public transit. As you know, this just came out this afternoon. So right now, the Department of Homeland Security, who would be implementing, and the CDC are reviewing the decision. And of course, the Department of Justice would make any determinations about litigation. Some US airports are still requiring masks as of this morning. And while airlines are ditching masking rules for domestic flights, they'll still require them on certain international flights for now. It's been two years since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down workplaces around the world and sent whoever could work at home to do so. Nowadays, more and more employers are again requiring their staffs to be on-site, but not everyone is on board. Economic Opportunity Reporter Charisse Jones has more. Charisse Jones: I think that there are certainly people who want to get back to the office. They want to get that real face time with their managers. They want to see colleagues. They want that demarcation, that line between work and home. But you have a lot of folks who are starting to get concerned about the cost of commuting as they resume going back to the office, especially with inflation hitting a 40 year high and gas prices ranging above $4 a gallon on average. And so for the folks who are reluctant to go back to the office, that's one more straw on the camel's back. So we had a poll that Harris Poll did for USA TODAY, and it found that 78% of the people that we talked to were concerned about the cost of gas, which is averaging more than $4 a gallon right now, in terms of going back to the office. You had 72% who were worried about the costs of buying groceries, just having to make your lunch or buy lunch now that you were out and about again. 38% were fretting about fares on buses and trains. And so you have a lot of folks, especially millennials and parents that have kids under 18, about 63% of them are worried about childcare costs, who are worried about just stretching their budgets at a time when prices have really elevated. They're straining their budgets. And the idea of now having to go back to the office on top of losing work-life balance and spending time in traffic, paying that extra cost is something that's keeping them up a little bit at night. You can find Charisse's full story in today's episode description. President Joe Biden will make an appearance in Portsmouth, New Hampshire today. There, he plans to discuss how investments in infrastructure will improve the country's ports and waterways. He's expected to especially highlight how those investments will strengthen supply chains and keep goods moving to help lower prices. Biden's visit comes as Americans continue to face record high gas prices and rising inflation rates. Prices were already rising before the war in Ukraine, but have been skyrocketing since. Biden and his administration have responded by tapping the nation's oil reserves and pushing the US petroleum industry to boost production. He's also courted countries abroad, like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, to compensate for his ban on Russian energy imports. Stargazers will have a chance to catch the Lyrid meteor shower this week, late at night, but those who are up in the early mornings could glimpse another phenomenon. Four planets in our solar system will appear to line up in the sky. Reporter Jordan Mendoza tells us how we can see it. Jordan Mendoza: Good news. If you want to see Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter all at the same time, now is the time to do so. So they're all going to be able to be seen in the early morning sky. So we're talking about the hour before the sun rises, if you just happen to look where the sun rises. So if you look towards the east, you'll see all the planets in alignment. And the thing that's cool about it is that as this week goes on, they're going to seem as if they're in a diagonal line, like they're all perfectly lined up. And it's fascinating because this is happening because of their rotations. Obviously, they're not all lined up right next to each other in the solar system because of their orbits, but they're all in the same path at the same exact time. So it's really interesting to see how that's going to look. And people can see it with their own two eyes. You don't need a telescope. You don't need binoculars to see it. You can see it if it's dark enough for you out there. Right now, you can see it at any point every morning for the rest of the month, but as the month goes on, you'll see them start to shift a little bit. And then also from April 25th to the 27th, you're going to see the moon join in, which is really cool. So you'll see the moon each of those three mornings. It's going to just shift underneath different planets. So it's going to be a really cool scene for people that love space and love looking at the planets. I wouldn't say it's common. It's definitely something that you don't see every day. In December 2020, it was a huge deal. It was called the Great Conjunction, when Jupiter and Saturn were basically lined up around each other. And those are two of the biggest planets that we have in our solar system. So people were really psyched about it. But it is something super rare, but it's not going to be the rarest thing that we see this year, because in late June and into early July, we're going to see Mercury join this group of planets. So you'll be able to see Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn all in the morning sky. So this is going to be a cool event. You can see up to four planets. But just in a couple of months, you're going to be able to see five, which is really cool for people that are really interested in seeing what our planets can look like. Check out Jordan's piece in today's episode description. And you can find new episodes of 5 Things each morning, all year long. Thanks to PJ Elliott for his great work on the shownd I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY."

Latest news.,"Russian forces have launched an offensive spanning over a 300-mile front in its long-anticipated attack on eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said Monday.
Russian forces completely retreated from … [+2255 chars]","Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Tuesday, April 19. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Wednesday, April 20, as Russia's invasion continues.  Russia's attacks in eastern Ukraine mark a new phase in the war as U.S. officials believe they will prelude a major offensive in the Donbas region, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Tuesday. The assault, stretching some 300 miles from northeastern Ukraine to the country’s southeast since Monday, comes as Russia continues to add to its forces in Ukraine and resupply those already inside the country, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings. The Russians inserted two battalion tactical groups into Ukraine in the last day, to increase the number to 78, the official said. Russian battalions vary in size from about 800 to 1,000 troops. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials acknowledged Tuesday the war had entered a new phase. Ukraine’s military said “the occupiers made an attempt to break through our defenses along nearly the entire frontline,” while Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the goal was ""full liberation"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian forces said Russia was dropping heavy bombs to flatten the remains of a steel plant and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying in Mariupol. The Russians, who invaded Feb. 24, have faced a spirited and effective resistance from Ukrainian troops and lost about 25% of the combat force deployed by President Vladimir Putin, the U.S. official said. The new phase of the war and resupplied Russian forces came as President Joe Biden was expected to announce a new security assistance package in the coming days that will include additional artillery and ammunition, according to a U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, though details of the package were still being finalized.  Last week, in anticipation of Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine, Biden approved an $800 million package including additional helicopters and the first provision of American artillery.

Russian forces completely retreated from … [+2255 chars]","Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Tuesday, April 19. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Wednesday, April 20, as Russia's invasion continues.  Russia's attacks in eastern Ukraine mark a new phase in the war as U.S. officials believe they will prelude a major offensive in the Donbas region, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Tuesday. The assault, stretching some 300 miles from northeastern Ukraine to the country’s southeast since Monday, comes as Russia continues to add to its forces in Ukraine and resupply those already inside the country, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings. The Russians inserted two battalion tactical groups into Ukraine in the last day, to increase the number to 78, the official said. Russian battalions vary in size from about 800 to 1,000 troops. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials acknowledged Tuesday the war had entered a new phase. Ukraine’s military said “the occupiers made an attempt to break through our defenses along nearly the entire frontline,” while Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the goal was ""full liberation"" in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian forces said Russia was dropping heavy bombs to flatten the remains of a steel plant and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying in Mariupol. The Russians, who invaded Feb. 24, have faced a spirited and effective resistance from Ukrainian troops and lost about 25% of the combat force deployed by President Vladimir Putin, the U.S. official said. The new phase of the war and resupplied Russian forces came as President Joe Biden was expected to announce a new security assistance package in the coming days that will include additional artillery and ammunition, according to a U.S. official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, though details of the package were still being finalized.  Last week, in anticipation of Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine, Biden approved an $800 million package including additional helicopters and the first provision of American artillery. The U.S. has sent about $2.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's reelection may be in jeopardy. A federal judge on Monday ruled that a group of Georgia voters can proceed with legal efforts seeking to disqualify U.S Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for reelection to Congress, citing her role in the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol. The challenge filed last month with the Georgia secretary of state's office alleges that Greene, a Republican, helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021 riot that disrupted Congress from certifying Joe Biden's presidential election victory. That violates a rarely cited provision of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection, according to the challenge. The amendment says no one can serve in Congress ""who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same."" Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Cawthorn faced similar disputes: In January of this year, a group of North Carolina voters told state officials they want U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn disqualified as a congressional candidate for his involvement with the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. It's Amy and Chelsey with today's top stories out of Washington. From airlines to rideshare companies, transportation providers have quickly pivoted after a federal judge in Florida voided the federal mask mandate Monday. U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said the mandate exceeded the authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which failed to justify the order and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures. ""As a result of a court order, effective immediately and as of April 18, 2022, CDC’s January 29, 2021 order requiring masks on public transportation conveyances and at transportation hubs is no longer in effect,"" the CDC said in a statement also posted on its website. ""Therefore, CDC will not enforce the order. CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in indoor public transportation settings at this time."" Is the mask mandate overturned forever? White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the Justice Department was still reviewing the federal court’s decision and hasn’t determined whether to appeal, adding that the review process could take a couple of days. The mask mandate had been extended by 15 days last week and was set to expire on May 3. Psaki defended the administration's extension, arguing it was made to assess an increase in COVID-19 cases. ""We still feel that is entirely reasonable based on the latest science, and public health decisions shouldn't be made by the courts,"" Psaki said. ""They should be made by public health experts."" Are masks required on planes? Every major U.S. airline has now made face masks optional for passengers and employees.

President Joe Biden must walk a fine line between pursuing an agenda that may cost the Democratic party votes in the 2022 midterms while attracting those voters who want to see bold moves on climate action. He has already tapped into the nation’s oil reserves to boost oil production, but says the long-term solution is renewable energy. ""Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether,"" Biden said at the White House late last month. ""We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability."" Progressive Democrats agree that wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are the way out of the fuel crisis. But conservatives are pushing for more domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal to relieve fuel prices, which could reach $6 per gallon. Progressives on Capitol Hill also acknowledge the possibility that legislation that does not emphasize fossil fuels will be blocked in Congress if Republicans take back the House in November. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is already proposing to remove restrictions on natural gas development, restart the federal onshore and offshore leasing program pushed by then-President Donald Trump, and immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline. ""The solution is obvious: rapidly increase American energy production, thus replacing Russian oil and gas with energy made in the U.S.A.,"" he said last month. Ever had quitter's remorse?

Are masks required on planes? Every major U.S. airline has now made face masks optional for passengers and employees. That includes Delta, United, American and Southwest as well as Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant, and newer airlines like Breeze and Avelo. Do I need to wear a mask in an Uber or Lyft? Masks are now optional for riders and drivers on Uber and Lyft.

President Joe Biden must walk a fine line between pursuing an agenda that may cost the Democratic party votes in the 2022 midterms while attracting those voters who want to see bold moves on climate action. He has already tapped into the nation’s oil reserves to boost oil production, but says the long-term solution is renewable energy. ""Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether,"" Biden said at the White House late last month. ""We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability."" Progressive Democrats agree that wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are the way out of the fuel crisis. But conservatives are pushing for more domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal to relieve fuel prices, which could reach $6 per gallon. Progressives on Capitol Hill also acknowledge the possibility that legislation that does not emphasize fossil fuels will be blocked in Congress if Republicans take back the House in November. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is already proposing to remove restrictions on natural gas development, restart the federal onshore and offshore leasing program pushed by then-President Donald Trump, and immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline. ""The solution is obvious: rapidly increase American energy production, thus replacing Russian oil and gas with energy made in the U.S.A.,"" he said last month. Ever had quitter's remorse?

In 1854, a mother washed her baby’s diaper in a town well, touching off an epidemic that killed 616 people.  Within 250 yards of a water pump outside London, “upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera” occurred in 10 days. Dr. John Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow went to town officials and despite their reticence about his theories, he persuaded them to take the handle off the pump. The outbreak of cholera almost immediately ended. Today, scientists consider Snow to be the father of epidemiology. Hundreds died in that 1854 superspreader event, but millions have benefited because of the lessons learned.  We decided to help:My dad and I went to Poland and Ukraine to help refugees, including teens just like me I was part of a John Snow moment in 2014, when we had an HIV outbreak in rural Scott County, Indiana. At the time, I served as Indiana's health commissioner. Out of what was clearly a disastrous public health moment, syringe service programs were implemented first in Indiana, then in Kentucky, then in communities across America – particularly so in conservative ones. The example set and the lessons learned likely prevented thousands of hepatitis and HIV infections.   The recent Gridiron Club event in Washington, D.C., was by any objective measure a public health disaster. A mass gathering occurring during a global pandemic – attended by government leaders, members of the media who’ve regularly reported on the pandemic, and even the Centers of Disease Control Prevention director and the chief medical adviser to the president – resulted in the infection of 70 attendees and counting. (A team of USA TODAY journalists attended the Gridiron.) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Attorney General Merrick Garland are among the high-ranking government leaders who have tested positive for COVID-19 this month. However, with sufficient scrutiny (and humility), this could prove to be another John Snow moment. There are so many unanswered questions about the details of the event – what the protective protocols were, who was impacted, what we thought we knew, what turned out to be wrong – but the answers to those questions can help us do better and save lives in the future.  One of the unanswered questions about the Gridiron dinner harkens directly back to John Snow’s cholera outbreak: Who was infected? Just as in 1854, we now need thorough and transparent contact tracing so we can ascertain the source of the outbreak and determine precipitating factors. World Health Organization:Infodemic spreads faster than viruses Was the index case someone who had been recently infected but followed CDC guidance about leaving isolation early (where a study showed up to 40% may be still infectious)? Was it someone who is immunocompromised and carrying a higher than expected viral load? Was that person carrying a new variant? Knowing these answers helps us prevent the next outbreak.   Contact tracing also means determining everyone who was infected – and this speaks to health equity. So far, we’ve heard about attendees who were infected, but what about the staff working the event? It’s hard to believe that more than 70 attendees were infected but that no workers at the event were – workers who almost certainly had less wealth, were less likely to be insured and had much less choice in whether or not to be there in the first place. Every news report of an infected attendee doing “well” doesn’t mention the likely more vulnerable workers who may have been exposed is perpetuating health inequities.  Another source of possible inequity involves availability of treatment. How many of the diagnosed attendees at this event were given oral antiviral treatment – treatment that still isn’t available to most Americans and may not have been available to the workers at the event? Suggesting everyone infected has had a mild case without including key variables, such as access to treatment, encourages others to engage in risky behaviors without all the tools and knowledge to protect themselves.  Progressive wrong about Justice Thomas:And they have been for decades What was the vaccination and boost status of the individuals at the event who were infected? There is important information to be gleaned about whether or not third and fourth shots played a role in who was protected versus who wasn’t.   What were the other protective protocols? We know there was no masking requirement. It would be nice to also know whether any ventilation precautions were taken. One of the most helpful but least used preventive measures for gatherings is thought to be promoting proper ventilation. As with most things involving COVID-19, analysis of this event has been reduced to politics, finger-pointing and hyperbole. That has distracted us from discussing the potentially lifesaving lessons to be gleaned from a critical scientific and health equity assessment. Simply put, the American people deserve better from the White House COVID response team, public health officials and the news media. But despite politicians and pundits suggesting otherwise, mass gatherings that lead to mass infections cannot become our “new normal."" Up to 30% of people experience long-COVID symptoms even after a mild case, so despite the talk of most of the diagnosed doing well, statistically speaking not all of them will feel that way in six or 12 months. We also can’t normalize those with the resources to protect themselves returning to normal at the expense of a service industry that is victimized. Unfortunately, it's looking like it could repeat with the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on April 30.  Finally, there are many unanswered questions and potentially low-hanging fruit that can accelerate us toward a safer return to normal – if, like John Snow, we only have the courage to challenge conventional wisdom and dig a little deeper.  Dr. Jerome Adams, a former U.S. surgeon general, is a distinguished professor and executive director of health equity initiatives at Purdue University. Follow him on Twitter: @JeromeAdamsMD"

The Ukrainian General Staff said in a statement that defeating the last resistance in the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol remains Russia's top priority.

Ron DeSantis' battle with Disney continues Wednesday during a special legislative session on redistricting in the state of Florida. DeSantis expanded the scope of the session Tuesday, announcing that lawmakers will consider repealing the governing structure for Disney's Florida properties. This move could end special privileges the company has long enjoyed – and appears aimed at punishing Disney for speaking out against the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" law. The legislation, HB 3C and SB 4-C, the ""Independent Special Districts"" bill, quickly advanced in the House and Senate. Republicans on the House State Affairs Committee slammed Disney as ""perverted by a woke mob"" and ""goofy with power"" before the measure passed by a 14-7 vote and headed to committees. DeSantis has been aggressive in going after Disney in the wake of the company's criticism on HB 1557, the legislation officially known as the Parental Rights in Education act but derided by critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.  Hundreds of thousands of people still don't have power Wednesday morning after heavy, wet snow blanked swaths of the northeast from New England to West Virginia Tuesday. The nor'easter dumped 18 inches of heavy snow on Virgil, in central New York, while parts of eastern Pennsylvania received up to 14 inches of snowfall, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Snow fall was measured in states including Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia, the agency reported. The storm interrupted power to more than 350,000 utility customers in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. By early Wednesday morning, that number dropped to about 139,000, according to poweroutage.us, a website that tracks power outages across the country. At one point, around 47,000 customers were without power in northeast Pennsylvania, and about 27,400 remained without power by 1:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, poweroutage.us also reported.  Wednesday is April 20, or 4/20, or ""420,"" a day that has become known internationally as an unofficial celebration of all things cannabis-related. The somewhat-hazy origins of 420, also known as ""Weed Day,"" can be traced back to 1971, when a group of California high schoolers agreed to meet at 4:20 p.m. with map in hand to search for a plot of marijuana plants that had been abandoned by its owner.

As the song goes, he ""ain't as good as he once was,"" but 21-year-old TobyKeith – that'd be the dog, not the singer – broke a world record for being the world's oldest dog. Born on Jan. 9, 2001, TobyKeith, of Florida, was 21 years and 66 days old on March 16 when Guinness World Records confirmed he was the oldest dog alive. ""People can’t believe how good he looks for his age,"" the dog's owner, Gisela Shore, told Guinness. Two decades after she adopted him from a shelter as a puppy, people started to wonder about TobyKeith – was he the oldest dog alive? He had long surpassed the average life expectancy of a chihuahua, 12 to 18 years. Guinness confirmed that TobyKeith was a world record holder. Shore said good genetics, a healthy diet and a loving home were the secrets to his old age. According to Guinness, the oldest dog ever recorded was an Australian cattle dog that lived 29 years and 5 months. Ukrainian forces fought in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday after a Russian ultimatum to troops holed up in the Azovstal steel mill to lay down their arms passed without a mass surrender. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a social media post that the Ukrainian forces inside the sprawling steel plant faced attacks from the Russian military. Amid the siege in Mariupol and a shift in the fighting to eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials are considering a new military aid package. Four flights of U.S. arms, including howitzers, arrived in Eastern Europe in the past 24 hours, part of the $800 million aid package approved last week. Russia continues to attack in eastern Ukraine and reinforce its troops in the region for a broader offensive. 👉 More headlines: Ukraine Foreign Ministry wants four-day 'humanitarian pause'; Janet Yellen walks out of Russia's G-20 remarks.

The roller coaster price of gas might be headed up another hill. Gas prices have steadily decreased since reaching record highs in early March, but experts predict the fall won't last much longer as seasonal demand and the rise of oil prices are expected to increase the price at the pump. As of Wednesday, the national average for a regular gallon of gas is $4.11, according to AAA. Though it's still a ways to go to the national record – not adjusted for inflation – of $4.33 reached March 11, it is the first weekly increase since the average was $4.07 one week ago. In audio from multiple 911 calls released Wednesday, Kalabrya Haskins, wife of the late Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins, told the operator her husband was stuck on the side of a busy interstate near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and was walking to get gas on the morning he died after being struck by a dump truck. Kalabrya Haskins told the operator she was at home in Pittsburgh and was unable to reach Haskins on his phone, so she called 911 so officials could check on him. In addition to the audio of the 911 calls, the Florida Highway Patrol released a traffic crash incident report Wednesday that indicated Haskins was struck by a second vehicle after the dump truck. The incident took place April 9, when Haskins attempted to cross lanes of oncoming traffic on Interstate 595. He was 24.

As the song goes, he ""ain't as good as he once was,"" but 21-year-old TobyKeith – that'd be the dog, not the singer – broke a world record for being the world's oldest dog. Born on Jan. 9, 2001, TobyKeith, of Florida, was 21 years and 66 days old on March 16 when Guinness World Records confirmed he was the oldest dog alive. ""People can’t believe how good he looks for his age,"" the dog's owner, Gisela Shore, told Guinness. Two decades after she adopted him from a shelter as a puppy, people started to wonder about TobyKeith – was he the oldest dog alive? He had long surpassed the average life expectancy of a chihuahua, 12 to 18 years. Guinness confirmed that TobyKeith was a world record holder. Shore said good genetics, a healthy diet and a loving home were the secrets to his old age. According to Guinness, the oldest dog ever recorded was an Australian cattle dog that lived 29 years and 5 months. Ukrainian forces fought in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday after a Russian ultimatum to troops holed up in the Azovstal steel mill to lay down their arms passed without a mass surrender. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a social media post that the Ukrainian forces inside the sprawling steel plant faced attacks from the Russian military. Amid the siege in Mariupol and a shift in the fighting to eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials are considering a new military aid package. Four flights of U.S. arms, including howitzers, arrived in Eastern Europe in the past 24 hours, part of the $800 million aid package approved last week. Russia continues to attack in eastern Ukraine and reinforce its troops in the region for a broader offensive. 👉 More headlines: Ukraine Foreign Ministry wants four-day 'humanitarian pause'; Janet Yellen walks out of Russia's G-20 remarks.

The roller coaster price of gas might be headed up another hill. Gas prices have steadily decreased since reaching record highs in early March, but experts predict the fall won't last much longer as seasonal demand and the rise of oil prices are expected to increase the price at the pump. As of Wednesday, the national average for a regular gallon of gas is $4.11, according to AAA. Though it's still a ways to go to the national record – not adjusted for inflation – of $4.33 reached March 11, it is the first weekly increase since the average was $4.07 one week ago. In audio from multiple 911 calls released Wednesday, Kalabrya Haskins, wife of the late Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins, told the operator her husband was stuck on the side of a busy interstate near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and was walking to get gas on the morning he died after being struck by a dump truck. Kalabrya Haskins told the operator she was at home in Pittsburgh and was unable to reach Haskins on his phone, so she called 911 so officials could check on him. In addition to the audio of the 911 calls, the Florida Highway Patrol released a traffic crash incident report Wednesday that indicated Haskins was struck by a second vehicle after the dump truck. The incident took place April 9, when Haskins attempted to cross lanes of oncoming traffic on Interstate 595. He was 24.

The deputy commander of the Azov regimen… [+4209 chars]","Editor's note: On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his troops would not storm the steel mill in Mariupol and instead will block exits. This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Wednesday, April 20. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, April 21. Ukrainian forces continued to fight in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday after a Russian ultimatum to troops holed up in the Azovstal steel mill to lay down their arms passed without a mass surrender. About 1,000 civilians, including women and children, were still trapped in the steel mill along with Ukrainian soldiers, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday.  Zelenskyy said Russia has stonewalled Ukraine’s attempts to negotiate a safe exit for them. “We are open to different formats of exchange of our people for Russian people, Russian military that they have left behind,” he said. Ukraine also has tried to get Russia to agree on a humanitarian corridor to evacuate the 120,000 people who Zelenskyy said remain under siege in Mariupol. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk added the planned evacuation had failed because of Russia wouldn't observe a cease-fire. ""The humanitarian corridor didn’t work as planned,"" she said. Vereshchuk also charged that “due to the sloppiness” of the Russian military, it has failed to timely deliver those who were willing to evacuate to an area where Ukrainian buses were waiting for them. She said that efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol will resume Thursday.  Amid the siege in Mariupol and a shift in the fighting to eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials are also considering a new military aid package for Ukraine. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told CNN Wednesday that another round of security assistance would be announced ""in very short order."" Four flights of U.S. arms, including howitzers, arrived in eastern Europe in the last 24 hours, part of the $800 million aid package approved last week, according to a senior Defense Department official. U.S. troops have begun training about 50 Ukrainians to use the howitzers, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly about military operations. The training will take about a week and is occurring outside Ukraine. Those Ukrainians will then train their own forces on the equipment. Meanwhile, Russia continues attacks in eastern Ukraine and to reinforce its troops in the region for a broader offensive. The Russians have moved artillery units, headquarters staffs and helicopter units into the eastern Ukraine to support In the last 24 hours, four additional Russian battalion tactical groups have been sent into Ukraine, the official said. The battalions, of about 800 to 1,000 troops, have been built up over the last few weeks. They include infantry, artillery and logistics units. RUSSIA'S ARSENAL: What weapons are being used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine?  USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM:Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►The U.S. unveiled another round of sanctions Tuesday targeting Russian officials and organizations tied to the Kremlin. One batch announced by the Secretary of State targeted more than 600 individuals involved in suppressing dissent, media and democracy in the region. Another announced by the Treasury Department targeted banks and networks being used to evade U.S. sanctions.  ► More than 5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, according to a U.N. refugee agency's latest tally as of Wednesday. ►Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Wednesday the country would supply protective equipment like helmets and vests to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian organizations. Though it has provided humanitarian aid, Israel has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons and other direct military assistance. ►Nuclear regulators have regained phone contact with operators of the Chernobyl power plant more than a month after contact was lost, the International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. ►Russian and Belarusian tennis players will be barred from competing at Wimbledon due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the event's organizers said Wednesday.  'THE MORE WE CAN ALL HELP, THE BETTER':Tech CEO and family spend spring break helping colleagues in war-ravaged Ukraine The Luhansk governor said Russian forces now control 80% of the region, which is one of two regions that make up the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. One of Russia’s stated goals is to expand the territory in the Donbas under the control of Moscow-backed separatists. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region. Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, who renewed their offensive this week in eastern and southern Ukraine, have strengthened their attacks in the Luhansk region. After seizing Kreminna, Haidai said the Russians now are threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna and he has urged all residents to evacuate immediately. The Donetsk region, also part of the Donbas, has seen extremely heavy fighting as well — particularly around the port city of Mariupol. -The Associated Press Pentagon press secretary John Kirby is downplaying Russia’s launch of a new intercontinental ballistic missile that the Kremlin is counting on as the center of its nuclear strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the Sarmat missile uniquely capable of penetrating anti-missile defenses. And Russia’s space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin provocatively called Wednesday’s test flight “a present to NATO.” But Kirby said “Russia properly notified the United States under its New START obligations that it planned to test this ICBM. Such testing is routine. It was not a surprise. We did not deem the test to be a threat to the United States or its allies.” A 91-year-old Holocaust survivor has died in a basement in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol. The Auschwitz Memorial announced the death of Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova. The Jewish organization Chabad.org reported that her daughter shared the news after arriving with the rest of her family at a safe location, saying she died April 4, pleading for water in a freezing basement. She was 10 years old when the Nazis occupied Mariupol and killed thousands of Jews in a single day, including her mother. She survived in a basement then, and died in a basement in the same city 81 years later. Workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, say Russian troops dug trenches in contaminated soil and even stole radioactive materials after seizing control of the plant last month, likely exposing themselves to harmful levels of radiation.  Thousands of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone in the earliest hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, churning up highly contaminated soil.  A nuclear risk 'nightmare'?:After seizing Chernobyl, Russian troops exposed themselves to radiation. For more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor. A close inspection of their trenches was impossible because even walking on the dirt is discouraged. Some soldiers even stole highly radioactive materials as souvenirs or possibly to sell. “I think from movies they have the imagination that all dangerous small things are very valuable,” Valerii Semenov, the plant’s main security engineer, told The Associated Press. The Ukrainian foreign ministry on Wednesday said a four-day ""humanitarian pause"" was necessary to evacuate civilians after the United Nations chief called for a brief halt to hostilities for Easter. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called for the four-day pause beginning Thursday to observe Holy Week in the Orthodox Christian tradition. Guterres said it was even more necessary given the intensified attacks in eastern Ukraine this week ""We fully share the view that the humanitarian pause is necessary for the safe evacuation of thousands of civilians who wish to leave the dangerous zones of ongoing and possible hostilities, especially from the long-suffering Mariupol,"" Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. – Ryan Miller Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine's Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko walked out of a Group of 20 meeting Wednesday as Russia's representative started talking. Several finance ministers and central bank governors also left the room, according an official familiar with the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event was not public. Some ministers and central bank governors who attended the meeting virtually turned their cameras off when the Russia representative spoke, the person said. The incident came amid the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, in which finance heads gather to tackle the world's most pressing issues. The brutal effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine have taken center stage, and Treasury officials said earlier this week that Yellen would try to avoid contact with Russian officials who plan to attend some Group of 20 events virtually. President Joe Biden has said that Russia should not remain a member of the G-20, an international body of the world's biggest economies that promotes economic cooperation between countries. Elina Miliushnikova watched her 7-month-old son sleep in his crib late Tuesday in her darkened Kharkiv apartment, hours after Russian rockets blasted the district where her parents live. ""Today we are really sad and depressed,"" Miliushnikova, 31, told USA TODAY via WhatsApp before retreating to the building's basement for the night. ""All day we hear the sound of rockets."" Nearly two months into the war, Russian forces are escalating attacks on eastern Ukraine in what officials from both nations say marks a new phase of the invasion. Civilians concerned about the renewed assaults this week are stocking up on supplies, preparing exit plans and calling out to the world for assistance. Read more about their efforts here. – Grace Hauck MOSCOW – The Kremlin’s spokesman says Russia has presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands as part of peace talks and is now awaiting a response from Kyiv. Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters Wednesday that Russia has passed on a draft document containing “absolutely clear, elaborate wording” to Ukraine and now “the ball is in their court, we’re waiting for a response.” LET'S DRINK TO UKRAINE!':Odesa Jews celebrate a wartime Passover under curfew Peskov didn’t give further details. He blamed Ukraine for the slow progress in negotiations, and claimed that Kyiv constantly deviates from previously confirmed agreements. “The dynamic of work on the Ukrainian side leaves much to be desired, the Ukrainians do not show a great inclination to intensify the negotiation process,” he said. Ukraine presented Russia with its own draft last month in Istanbul, where the two sides held talks aimed at ending the conflict. It has been unclear how regularly the two sides have spoken to each other since then. U.S. officials are considering a new military aid package for Ukraine that includes American artillery cannons while working with allies in eastern Europe to send them Soviet-era long-range rockets to reach deeper into Russian lines, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. The new arms would follow an $800 million package approved last week that included howitzers. It comes as Russia has focused its forces in eastern Ukraine, where artillery and armored vehicles are expected to play a central role in the fighting. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that more military aid will likely be sent to Ukraine in coming months. The U.S. artillery will come from existing stocks and not affect readiness, the official said. When asked by a reporter Tuesday whether his administration would be sending more artillery to Ukraine, President Joe Biden responded, ""yes,"" but did not elaborate. – Tom Vanden Brook Estonia says it is prohibiting public meetings where people display Russian flags and military symbols during the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which is traditionally celebrated by the Baltic country’s sizable ethnic-Russian population to mark the end of World War II. Among the banned symbols are the flags of the Soviet Union and Russia, USSR military uniforms and the black-orange Ribbon of Saint George worn in Russia to mark the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in WWII. The ban is valid until May 10 and applies to the capital, Tallinn, and its surrounding areas. WHERE ARE NATO COUNTRIES? What is NATO? Military alliance in spotlight as Russia tries to forbid Ukraine membership DEADLINE FOR VICTORY? Russia's Victory Day on May 9 could mark key deadline in its invasion of Ukraine Russian troops were advancing toward Zaporizhzhia with battles occurring within the region, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday. The head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, Oleksandr Starukh, described the new advance as ""a massive offensive,"" according to state news agency Ukrinform. The city's regional council also warned of the Russian advance, CNN reported. Starukh said the area around the town of Polohy had worsened with daily attacks, Ukrinform reported, while the regional council said Russian troops were making advances in the direction of nearby Huliaipole and Pokrovske, CNN reported. The city of Zaporizhzhia is part of a humanitarian evacuation route from Mariupol that deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said would take take place Wednesday. Remaining residents in the port city of Mariupol should leave as Russian forces encircle the last pocket of Ukrainian defense inside the Azovstal steel mill, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said Wednesday. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Facebook a humanitarian corridor for women, children and older people had been agreed upon. Boychenko said buses, including one that that would pick up residents near the steel mill, would be used in the evacuation. Prior attempts relied on private cars as buses were unable to access to besieged city on the Sea of Azov. “Do not be frightened and evacuate to Zaporizhzhia, where you can receive all the help you need — food, medicine, essentials — and the main thing is that you will be in safety,” Boychenko wrote in a statement issued by the city council. More than 400,000 people lived in Mariupol before the Russian invasion, with at least half having since fled, Boychenko said. Russian shelling for weeks has left the city flattened and citizens without food or water.  Contributing: The Associated Press"
2022-04-20 10:04:07+00:00,Russia targets remaining Ukrainian resistance in devastated Mariupol: Live updates,"USA TODAY, Celina Tebor, USA TODAY",USA Today,usa-today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/04/20/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/7375163001/,Russian troops issued a new ultimatum for Ukrainian troops in Mariupol's Azovstal steel mill. Latest Ukraine news.,"Russian troops issued a new ultimatum for Ukrainian troops in Mariupol's Azovstal steel mill to surrender on Wednesday after they ignored Tuesday's deadline.
The deputy commander of the Azov regimen… [+4209 chars]","Editor's note: On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his troops would not storm the steel mill in Mariupol and instead will block exits. This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Wednesday, April 20. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Thursday, April 21. Ukrainian forces continued to fight in the besieged city of Mariupol on Wednesday after a Russian ultimatum to troops holed up in the Azovstal steel mill to lay down their arms passed without a mass surrender. About 1,000 civilians, including women and children, were still trapped in the steel mill along with Ukrainian soldiers, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday.  Zelenskyy said Russia has stonewalled Ukraine’s attempts to negotiate a safe exit for them. “We are open to different formats of exchange of our people for Russian people, Russian military that they have left behind,” he said. Ukraine also has tried to get Russia to agree on a humanitarian corridor to evacuate the 120,000 people who Zelenskyy said remain under siege in Mariupol. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk added the planned evacuation had failed because of Russia wouldn't observe a cease-fire. ""The humanitarian corridor didn’t work as planned,"" she said. Vereshchuk also charged that “due to the sloppiness” of the Russian military, it has failed to timely deliver those who were willing to evacuate to an area where Ukrainian buses were waiting for them. She said that efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol will resume Thursday.  Amid the siege in Mariupol and a shift in the fighting to eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials are also considering a new military aid package for Ukraine. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told CNN Wednesday that another round of security assistance would be announced ""in very short order."" Four flights of U.S. arms, including howitzers, arrived in eastern Europe in the last 24 hours, part of the $800 million aid package approved last week, according to a senior Defense Department official. U.S. troops have begun training about 50 Ukrainians to use the howitzers, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly about military operations. The training will take about a week and is occurring outside Ukraine. Those Ukrainians will then train their own forces on the equipment. Meanwhile, Russia continues attacks in eastern Ukraine and to reinforce its troops in the region for a broader offensive. The Russians have moved artillery units, headquarters staffs and helicopter units into the eastern Ukraine to support In the last 24 hours, four additional Russian battalion tactical groups have been sent into Ukraine, the official said. The battalions, of about 800 to 1,000 troops, have been built up over the last few weeks. They include infantry, artillery and logistics units. RUSSIA'S ARSENAL: What weapons are being used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine?  USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM:Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►The U.S. unveiled another round of sanctions Tuesday targeting Russian officials and organizations tied to the Kremlin. One batch announced by the Secretary of State targeted more than 600 individuals involved in suppressing dissent, media and democracy in the region. Another announced by the Treasury Department targeted banks and networks being used to evade U.S. sanctions.  ► More than 5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, according to a U.N. refugee agency's latest tally as of Wednesday. ►Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Wednesday the country would supply protective equipment like helmets and vests to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian organizations. Though it has provided humanitarian aid, Israel has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons and other direct military assistance. ►Nuclear regulators have regained phone contact with operators of the Chernobyl power plant more than a month after contact was lost, the International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. ►Russian and Belarusian tennis players will be barred from competing at Wimbledon due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the event's organizers said Wednesday.  'THE MORE WE CAN ALL HELP, THE BETTER':Tech CEO and family spend spring break helping colleagues in war-ravaged Ukraine The Luhansk governor said Russian forces now control 80% of the region, which is one of two regions that make up the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. One of Russia’s stated goals is to expand the territory in the Donbas under the control of Moscow-backed separatists. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region. Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, who renewed their offensive this week in eastern and southern Ukraine, have strengthened their attacks in the Luhansk region. After seizing Kreminna, Haidai said the Russians now are threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna and he has urged all residents to evacuate immediately. The Donetsk region, also part of the Donbas, has seen extremely heavy fighting as well — particularly around the port city of Mariupol. -The Associated Press Pentagon press secretary John Kirby is downplaying Russia’s launch of a new intercontinental ballistic missile that the Kremlin is counting on as the center of its nuclear strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the Sarmat missile uniquely capable of penetrating anti-missile defenses. And Russia’s space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin provocatively called Wednesday’s test flight “a present to NATO.” But Kirby said “Russia properly notified the United States under its New START obligations that it planned to test this ICBM. Such testing is routine. It was not a surprise. We did not deem the test to be a threat to the United States or its allies.” A 91-year-old Holocaust survivor has died in a basement in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol. The Auschwitz Memorial announced the death of Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova. The Jewish organization Chabad.org reported that her daughter shared the news after arriving with the rest of her family at a safe location, saying she died April 4, pleading for water in a freezing basement. She was 10 years old when the Nazis occupied Mariupol and killed thousands of Jews in a single day, including her mother. She survived in a basement then, and died in a basement in the same city 81 years later. Workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, say Russian troops dug trenches in contaminated soil and even stole radioactive materials after seizing control of the plant last month, likely exposing themselves to harmful levels of radiation.  Thousands of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone in the earliest hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, churning up highly contaminated soil.  A nuclear risk 'nightmare'?:After seizing Chernobyl, Russian troops exposed themselves to radiation. For more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor. A close inspection of their trenches was impossible because even walking on the dirt is discouraged. Some soldiers even stole highly radioactive materials as souvenirs or possibly to sell. “I think from movies they have the imagination that all dangerous small things are very valuable,” Valerii Semenov, the plant’s main security engineer, told The Associated Press. The Ukrainian foreign ministry on Wednesday said a four-day ""humanitarian pause"" was necessary to evacuate civilians after the United Nations chief called for a brief halt to hostilities for Easter. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called for the four-day pause beginning Thursday to observe Holy Week in the Orthodox Christian tradition. Guterres said it was even more necessary given the intensified attacks in eastern Ukraine this week ""We fully share the view that the humanitarian pause is necessary for the safe evacuation of thousands of civilians who wish to leave the dangerous zones of ongoing and possible hostilities, especially from the long-suffering Mariupol,"" Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. – Ryan Miller Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine's Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko walked out of a Group of 20 meeting Wednesday as Russia's representative started talking. Several finance ministers and central bank governors also left the room, according an official familiar with the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event was not public. Some ministers and central bank governors who attended the meeting virtually turned their cameras off when the Russia representative spoke, the person said. The incident came amid the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, in which finance heads gather to tackle the world's most pressing issues. The brutal effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine have taken center stage, and Treasury officials said earlier this week that Yellen would try to avoid contact with Russian officials who plan to attend some Group of 20 events virtually. President Joe Biden has said that Russia should not remain a member of the G-20, an international body of the world's biggest economies that promotes economic cooperation between countries. Elina Miliushnikova watched her 7-month-old son sleep in his crib late Tuesday in her darkened Kharkiv apartment, hours after Russian rockets blasted the district where her parents live. ""Today we are really sad and depressed,"" Miliushnikova, 31, told USA TODAY via WhatsApp before retreating to the building's basement for the night. ""All day we hear the sound of rockets."" Nearly two months into the war, Russian forces are escalating attacks on eastern Ukraine in what officials from both nations say marks a new phase of the invasion. Civilians concerned about the renewed assaults this week are stocking up on supplies, preparing exit plans and calling out to the world for assistance. Read more about their efforts here. – Grace Hauck MOSCOW – The Kremlin’s spokesman says Russia has presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands as part of peace talks and is now awaiting a response from Kyiv. Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters Wednesday that Russia has passed on a draft document containing “absolutely clear, elaborate wording” to Ukraine and now “the ball is in their court, we’re waiting for a response.” LET'S DRINK TO UKRAINE!':Odesa Jews celebrate a wartime Passover under curfew Peskov didn’t give further details. He blamed Ukraine for the slow progress in negotiations, and claimed that Kyiv constantly deviates from previously confirmed agreements. “The dynamic of work on the Ukrainian side leaves much to be desired, the Ukrainians do not show a great inclination to intensify the negotiation process,” he said. Ukraine presented Russia with its own draft last month in Istanbul, where the two sides held talks aimed at ending the conflict. It has been unclear how regularly the two sides have spoken to each other since then. U.S. officials are considering a new military aid package for Ukraine that includes American artillery cannons while working with allies in eastern Europe to send them Soviet-era long-range rockets to reach deeper into Russian lines, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. The new arms would follow an $800 million package approved last week that included howitzers. It comes as Russia has focused its forces in eastern Ukraine, where artillery and armored vehicles are expected to play a central role in the fighting. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that more military aid will likely be sent to Ukraine in coming months. The U.S. artillery will come from existing stocks and not affect readiness, the official said.

Today Biden's dilemma on energy, plus a new evacuation effort in Mariupol and more. Here are some of the top headlines: ♦ President Joe Biden is facing a dilemma when it comes to energy. He's made clean energy a huge part of his agenda, but amid skyrocketing gas prices, Biden's been forced to tap into oil reserves while also pushing petroleum companies to ramp up production. Washington correspondent Ledyard King has more. Ledyard King: President Biden was already facing an uphill climb to meet these ambitious climate change agenda goals that he had set out during the campaign and that he had started to work on in the first weeks of his presidency. And then boom, here comes the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here comes the decision to ban the import of Russian oil, which accounts for about 8% of our own energy consumption. And you know, that oil has to be made. That lack of oil has to be made up somehow, so he's tapped into the reserves and he's urged oil companies to ramp up production, at least in the short term. But obviously it's a mixed message. Here you have a president who wants to claim the mantle of the greatest climate president ever, all of a sudden asking oil companies to produce more gas. And so it's this dilemma that he faces. The advocates behind the climate movement have so far, been willing to acknowledge Biden's dilemma and they say, ""Look, a short term release of more oil, or production, or gas, to help consumers through this very troubling time."" I mean, gas approaching $6 a gallon. They have said, ""We get it. Let's, the short term, ease the pain."" But long term, they still expect Biden to fulfill his climate, or at least pursue his climate agenda, and Biden himself has said the same thing. You know what we're doing in the short term, won't undermine, shouldn't undermine, the long term goals of reducing climate change. You can find this full story in today's episode description. Russia is heavily focusing on the coastal Ukrainian city of Mariupol on this Wednesday. A small group of a few thousand Ukrainian troops is holding out at the Azovstal steel mill there, but Russia dropped bombs on the plant and Ukrainian authorities say Russia also hit a hospital in Mariupol, where hundreds were staying. A humanitarian corridor is supposed to open today to allow for more evacuations out of the city but Russia has blocked off such evacuation convoys in the past. And Russia said it sent airstrikes around Zaporizhzhia, the destination for many Mariupol evacuees. Russia also struck near Dnipro, as well as Kharkiv and Kramatorsk. Earlier this month, a strike on a train station in Kramatorsk killed nearly 60 people. Many residents still there, like Elena Panova  have had to rely on aid to get by, lining up for food, while missiles hit in the background. Taylor Wilson translating for Elena Panova: ""You see a lot of people have lost their jobs. For example, my employer is an entrepreneur and he is gone. We were left unemployed, no financial support. I've spent the money I had, yet we are trying to be here and to do like this. The charity foundations are helping.""

Governor Ron DeSantis' battle with Disney rolls on today during a special legislative session on redistricting in the state of Florida. DeSantis expanded this scope of the session yesterday, announcing that lawmakers will consider repealing the current governing structure for Disney's Florida properties. That move could end special privileges, the company has long had, and it's likely aimed at punishing Disney for speaking out against the so-called, ""Don't Say Gay"" law. Officially known as the Parental Rights In Education Act, the legislation signed into law last month, states that classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through third grade. LGBTQ rights organizations say the bill could discriminate against gay and transgender individuals and even prevent students from discussing their LGBTQ families. Disney CEO, facing pressure to take a stand, called DeSantis to express disappointment in the law. Hundreds of nursing homes shut down or closed wings during the COVID -19 pandemic and as Health Reporter Ken Alltucker tells us, the problem could get worse as government assistance runs out. Ken Alltucker: Nursing homes nationwide, and particularly in some regions like rural areas in some big cities, are having trouble attracting enough workers. It's been a long standing issue that even pre-dated the COVID-19 pandemic. But what a lot of experts are telling me and homes are telling me is that it worsen during the pandemic. First of all, because you know, a lot of these workers, often low wage positions like nurses aides, were put in harm's way during the early days of the pandemic before there was enough protective equipment for them to wear and certainly before the vaccines were available. And that's when most deaths happened in nursing homes. Since then, and during the pandemic, you're seeing a broader issue in labor markets being really tight, so the unemployment rate is low right now, so people have a lot of choices, particularly for these low wage nurse aid jobs. They might have other opportunities to get raises elsewhere and higher wage jobs. One outgrowth of that is nurse staffing agencies. These are independent staffing agencies that place workers in healthcare facilities, hospitals, outpatient centers, nursing homes, et cetera. They've played a pretty important role in getting workers into these buildings. And so, because they're so much demand for their services, they're charging rates, some homes tell me two to three times what the pre-pandemic rates were. So these are pretty expensive bills for nursing homes to pay. Now, the federal government has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to nursing homes and in aid during the pandemic and some homes use that money to pay for these wages that they needed to hire these temporary workers, these staffing agency workers to fill shifts at their homes, so that's been that. But you know, what they're saying is it's not really a long term solution and there really needs to be more effort to attract workers there to these homes. Check out Ken's full story and more of his work in today's episode description. Happy 4/20. Today has become known around the world as an unofficial celebration of all things cannabis related and is also known as Weed Day. Its origins can be traced back to 1971, when a group of California high schoolers agreed to meet at 4:20 PM. They had a map and a plan to search for a plot of marijuana plants, supposedly abandoned by its owner. Nowadays weed is more of a societal norm in much of the country, and there are even some civic festivities planned, including a party in Weed, California. And in places where cannabis is legal, dispensaries are offering promotions and discounts. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Since then, and during the pandemic, you're seeing a broader issue in labor markets being really tight, so the unemployment rate is low right now, so people have a lot of choices, particularly for these low wage nurse aid jobs. They might have other opportunities to get raises elsewhere and higher wage jobs. One outgrowth of that is nurse staffing agencies. These are independent staffing agencies that place workers in healthcare facilities, hospitals, outpatient centers, nursing homes, et cetera. They've played a pretty important role in getting workers into these buildings. And so, because they're so much demand for their services, they're charging rates, some homes tell me two to three times what the pre-pandemic rates were. So these are pretty expensive bills for nursing homes to pay. Now, the federal government has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to nursing homes and in aid during the pandemic and some homes use that money to pay for these wages that they needed to hire these temporary workers, these staffing agency workers to fill shifts at their homes, so that's been that. But you know, what they're saying is it's not really a long term solution and there really needs to be more effort to attract workers there to these homes. Check out Ken's full story and more of his work in today's episode description. Happy 4/20. Today has become known around the world as an unofficial celebration of all things cannabis related and is also known as Weed Day. Its origins can be traced back to 1971, when a group of California high schoolers agreed to meet at 4:20 PM. They had a map and a plan to search for a plot of marijuana plants, supposedly abandoned by its owner. Nowadays weed is more of a societal norm in much of the country, and there are even some civic festivities planned, including a party in Weed, California. And in places where cannabis is legal, dispensaries are offering promotions and discounts. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

This is the new Babi Yar,” Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said, referring to the site of multiple Nazi massacres in which nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed in 1941. Boychenko and the city council in Mariupol accused Russians of burying civilians killed in Manhush, about 12 miles west of Mariupol, in large trenches they had dug. He said “the bodies started disappearing from the streets of the city,” charging that the Russians were “hiding the trace of their crimes and using the mass grave as one of the instruments for that.” “Then Hitler killed Jews, Roma and Slavs. And now Putin is destroying Ukrainians. He has already killed tens of thousands of civilians in Mariupol,” Boychenko said. “This requires a strong reaction from the entire world. We need to stop the genocide by any means possible.” Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor who is not currently in the city, posted satellite photos to Telegram claiming to show the growing mass grave, according to CNN. He said the graves appear about 100 feet deep. The accuracy of these claims and images could not be immediately verified. The jarring claim came the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted victory in the battle for Mariupol, even as hundreds of Ukrainian troops hold out in and around a sprawling steel plant in the city. President Joe Biden pushed back on Putin's claim, saying there isn't evidence yet of a Russian victory. “It’s questionable whether he does control Mariu pol,” Biden said. “There’s no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.” RUSSIA'S ARSENAL: What weapons are being used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine?  USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM:Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel NEW PHASE OF WAR:As Russia escalates attacks, what a new phase of war means for Ukrainians in the east Latest developments: ►A poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows 54% of Americans think President Joe Biden has been “not tough enough” in his response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Thirty-six percent think his approach has been about right, while 8% say he’s been too tough. ►Britain announced new sanctions on 26 companies and military leaders, including some generals accused of ""committing atrocities"" on the front lines. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the sanction targets ""have blood on their hands."" ►Chinese leader Xi Jinping reaffirmed his rejection of sanctions for Russia and again refused to criticize Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He once again called for a negotiated settlement of the crisis. Russia announced it was barring more than two dozen high-profile Americans from entering the country, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg over U.S. sanctions and harsh criticism of the Kremlin.  In a statement on its website Thursday, the ministry said that the move came as a response to “ever-widening anti-Russian sanctions” brought on by the Biden administration. It claimed to be targeting top executives, public intellectuals and journalists shaping what it referred to as “the Russophobic narrative” prevailing in US public debate. Alongside Harris and Zuckerberg, the ban includes top defense and justice officials; the CEOs of LinkedIn and Bank of America; high-profile foreign affairs commentators; as well as the editor of the Russia-focused Meduza news website. In a statement Thursday, the ministry said that the travel bans would apply “in perpetuity” and that the sanctions list would be updated “shortly” in responsible to the “hostile actions” of Western authorities. But one of the people targeted by the sanctions, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price, said he views the designation as an honor. “I have to say it is nothing less than an accolade to earn the ire of a government that lies to its own people, brutalizes its neighbors and seeks to create a world where freedom and liberty are put on the run and, if they have their way, extinguished,” Price told reporters in Washington. President Joe Biden announced additional military aid for Ukraine on Thursday totaling about $800 million, matching the same amount designated last week as Russia concentrates withering attacks on the eastern region of Donbas.  ""We will never fail in our efforts to defend freedom and oppose tyranny,"" Biden said from the White House Roosevelt Room. The U.S. military aid to Ukraine includes 72 155mm howitzers, 72 trucks to tow them and 144,000 artillery rounds, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. The howitzers will outfit five Ukrainian artillery battalions specifically for fighting in the Donbas, Kirby said. Also included are 121 Phoenix Ghost drones developed by the U.S. Air Force specifically for the Ukrainians, Kirby said. The drones have abilities to the Switchblade kamikaze drones, which are single-use, armed drones that fit in a backpack. They are designed with cameras, guidance systems and abort systems. Biden said not all the U.S. assistance is being advertised. “Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well,” Biden said, taking about surface-to-air Javelin missiles and playing off a famous line from President Theodore Roosevelt. The latest infusion of security assistance brings the total U.S. aid to Ukraine during Joe Biden’s presidency to about $4 billion, $3.4 billion of it since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Biden said more military help will be coming. The U.S. also will provide $500 million more in financial assistance for Ukraine to sustain salaries, pensions and other government programs, Biden said. That is on top of $500 million committed for similar purposes last month. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday that ""we know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild.” Nineteen Ukrainians were released from Russian captivity Thursday in a second prisoner swap to take place this week, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereschuk said in a Facebook post.  ""Today we bring home 19 people, including 10 military (including 2 officers) and 9 civilians,"" she wrote. ""This time there are wounded among the fired, and this is very important. Well now they will be able to get full treatment and go through a rehabilitation course."" She credited President Volodymyr Zelensky's ""constant personal involvement"" in the process. The release came two days after 76 Ukrainians, including 60 soldiers, were returned to their families. The number of Russian prisoners involved in the exchange was not released, but previous exchanges have involved equal numbers of Ukrainians and Russians. Ukrainians displaced by the war will be allowed to seek temporary refuge in the United States under a new program the Biden administration announced Thursday. President Joe Biden has promised the U.S. would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. Starting next week, Ukrainians can apply for a streamlined approval process to enter the United States for up to two years under the Uniting for Ukraine program. To qualify, they must have been a resident of Ukraine as of Feb. 11 and have a U.S sponsor. They also will be required to undergo a background check, pass biometric screenings and complete vaccinations and meet other public health requirements. People who want to sponsor a refugee must undergo background screenings to make sure they are able to support the refugees and won’t exploit or abuse them. The number of refugees who have fled Ukraine has surpassed 5 million and continues to rise. Another 7.7 million have been displaced within the country, the U.N. says. The U.S. will ban Russian ships from U.S. ports in retaliation for the war in Ukraine. No ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a U.S. port or access U.S. shores, President Joe Biden said Thursday. Biden said the ban would further deny Russia “the benefits of international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.” Earlier this month, the European Union banned Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing ports in its 27-nation bloc but provided exemptions for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. The United Kingdom and Canada also have banned Russian ships from their ports. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in the battle for Mariupol on Thursday and canceled plans to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in a sprawling steel plant. Putin called the military effort to liberate Mariupol a ""success"" and urged Ukrainian troops holed up in the Azovstal plant to surrender, promising ""decent treatment"" for all and medical attention to the wounded. He ordered Russian troops to blockade the plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters remained inside the Azovstal steel plant.  ""There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,"" Putin said. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot fly through."" Biden, responding to a question from a reporter Thursday, pushed back at Putin's claims. “It’s questionable whether he does control Mariupol,” Biden said. “There’s no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.” Contributing: The Associated Press"

It claimed to be targeting top executives, public intellectuals and journalists shaping what it referred to as “the Russophobic narrative” prevailing in US public debate. Alongside Harris and Zuckerberg, the ban includes top defense and justice officials; the CEOs of LinkedIn and Bank of America; high-profile foreign affairs commentators; as well as the editor of the Russia-focused Meduza news website. In a statement Thursday, the ministry said that the travel bans would apply “in perpetuity” and that the sanctions list would be updated “shortly” in responsible to the “hostile actions” of Western authorities. But one of the people targeted by the sanctions, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price, said he views the designation as an honor. “I have to say it is nothing less than an accolade to earn the ire of a government that lies to its own people, brutalizes its neighbors and seeks to create a world where freedom and liberty are put on the run and, if they have their way, extinguished,” Price told reporters in Washington. President Joe Biden announced additional military aid for Ukraine on Thursday totaling about $800 million, matching the same amount designated last week as Russia concentrates withering attacks on the eastern region of Donbas.  ""We will never fail in our efforts to defend freedom and oppose tyranny,"" Biden said from the White House Roosevelt Room. The U.S. military aid to Ukraine includes 72 155mm howitzers, 72 trucks to tow them and 144,000 artillery rounds, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. The howitzers will outfit five Ukrainian artillery battalions specifically for fighting in the Donbas, Kirby said. Also included are 121 Phoenix Ghost drones developed by the U.S. Air Force specifically for the Ukrainians, Kirby said. The drones have abilities to the Switchblade kamikaze drones, which are single-use, armed drones that fit in a backpack. They are designed with cameras, guidance systems and abort systems. Biden said not all the U.S. assistance is being advertised. “Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well,” Biden said, taking about surface-to-air Javelin missiles and playing off a famous line from President Theodore Roosevelt. The latest infusion of security assistance brings the total U.S. aid to Ukraine during Joe Biden’s presidency to about $4 billion, $3.4 billion of it since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Biden said more military help will be coming. The U.S. also will provide $500 million more in financial assistance for Ukraine to sustain salaries, pensions and other government programs, Biden said. That is on top of $500 million committed for similar purposes last month. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday that ""we know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild.” Nineteen Ukrainians were released from Russian captivity Thursday in a second prisoner swap to take place this week, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereschuk said in a Facebook post.  ""Today we bring home 19 people, including 10 military (including 2 officers) and 9 civilians,"" she wrote. ""This time there are wounded among the fired, and this is very important. Well now they will be able to get full treatment and go through a rehabilitation course."" She credited President Volodymyr Zelensky's ""constant personal involvement"" in the process. The release came two days after 76 Ukrainians, including 60 soldiers, were returned to their families. The number of Russian prisoners involved in the exchange was not released, but previous exchanges have involved equal numbers of Ukrainians and Russians. Ukrainians displaced by the war will be allowed to seek temporary refuge in the United States under a new program the Biden administration announced Thursday. President Joe Biden has promised the U.S. would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. Starting next week, Ukrainians can apply for a streamlined approval process to enter the United States for up to two years under the Uniting for Ukraine program. To qualify, they must have been a resident of Ukraine as of Feb. 11 and have a U.S sponsor. They also will be required to undergo a background check, pass biometric screenings and complete vaccinations and meet other public health requirements. People who want to sponsor a refugee must undergo background screenings to make sure they are able to support the refugees and won’t exploit or abuse them. The number of refugees who have fled Ukraine has surpassed 5 million and continues to rise. Another 7.7 million have been displaced within the country, the U.N. says. The U.S. will ban Russian ships from U.S. ports in retaliation for the war in Ukraine. No ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a U.S. port or access U.S. shores, President Joe Biden said Thursday. Biden said the ban would further deny Russia “the benefits of international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.” Earlier this month, the European Union banned Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing ports in its 27-nation bloc but provided exemptions for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. The United Kingdom and Canada also have banned Russian ships from their ports. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in the battle for Mariupol on Thursday and canceled plans to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in a sprawling steel plant. Putin called the military effort to liberate Mariupol a ""success"" and urged Ukrainian troops holed up in the Azovstal plant to surrender, promising ""decent treatment"" for all and medical attention to the wounded. He ordered Russian troops to blockade the plant. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters remained inside the Azovstal steel plant.  ""There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,"" Putin said. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot fly through."" Biden, responding to a question from a reporter Thursday, pushed back at Putin's claims. “It’s questionable whether he does control Mariupol,” Biden said. “There’s no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.” Contributing: The Associated Press"

There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 21st of April 2022. Today, what's the latest with masking on planes? Plus the last stand in Mariupol and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  ♦ The CDC has decided that its order requiring masks on planes and other public transit is still needed. In a statement, the agency wrote, ""It is CDC's continuing as assessment that at this time, an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health. CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary. CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC's legal authority to protect public health."" That comes after a Florida federal judge, earlier this week, voided the federal mask mandate for travelers. But the CDC decision will not immediately change the end to that mask mandate. Instead, the Department of Justice has now filed an appeal. That means you can keep that mask off on a plane or bus if you want to for now. But the back and forth has thrown the Biden administration into an awkward situation. If the appeal succeeds and passengers are forced to wear masks on planes again, President Joe Biden could face political blowback. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, though, said the Justice Department's appeal is needed. Jen Psaki: The objective here is of course to appeal the 15-day extension, but also to preserve the CDC authority over the long term. Because as we've noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs in the pandemic. And we certainly want the CDC to continue to have this authority. After the Florida judge's ruling this week, every major US airline and many airports, though not all, said they would no longer enforce face coverings. The same goes for Uber, Lyft, Greyhound and Amtrak. Those on the front lines of enforcing masking rules have been employees, like flight attendants. Sara Nelson, head of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said the biggest issue this week was how the change in masking rules happened. Sara Nelson: First of all, there's really a mixed bag of reaction to the end of the federal mask mandate. There are some people who are very excited because they don't want to have to wear the mask for 14, 15, 16 hour days. And they feel confident being vaccinated and taking the steps to protect themselves. The way that this was rolled out, this gave no ability for people to understand what the rules were once again. And here, the frontline workers, the flight attendants and other workers at the airport, were caught holding the bag once again, when people thought that they bought a ticket, came to the airport, got on a flight with a certain set of rules and they changed midflight. The federal mask mandate was announced in January of 2021, replacing previous masking rules in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic. Before the judge's decision, the mandate was set to last until at least May 3rd. Effective treatments for COVID-19 are now widely available. So why are they not being used? Patient Safety Reporter Karen Weintraub has an answer. Karen Weintraub: There are two classes of treatments. One is called antivirals and one is called monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies have been around longer, we heard about them when President Trump was sick with COVID. And the idea is that it gives you the things your body would naturally have to fight off disease. As the virus has evolved, the earlier monoclonals don't work anymore. There's only one that still does. So there are limited options with monoclonal antibodies. With antivirals, there are two options. One is called Paxlovid, it's from Pfizer. And the other is called Molnupiravir, from Merck and Ridgeback Therapeutics. And those help your body fight off the virus before it can gain a real foothold. Paxlovid in particular has been shown to be extremely effective, preventing 90% of hospitalizations. Essentially, or at the beginning of this year, shortly after Paxlovid and Molnupiravir were approved, there weren't a lot of doses available. Particularly Paxlovid, it's hard to produce, it took a while to produce. So there weren't very many doses available. And lots of people were sick with COVID and needed doses. Now, there are plenty of doses available, fewer people are sick, but they're not being prescribed very much. In large part, it seems because primary care doctors don't know about them, and sick people don't know to ask for them. So I think it's important to get the word out that these exist. They are aimed at high-risk people, at the people who would likely have a bad course of disease if they did get sick, so somebody who is say over 65, or immunocompromised, or has a number of ailments. So they're not aimed at 20-year-old healthy people, but they do prevent hospitalizations in people who are more likely to be hospitalized with COVID. You can find more of Karen on Twitter @kweintraub. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the coastal city of Mariupol. His order instead is to block the Azovstal steel mill, where a few thousand remaining Ukrainian troops are trying to hold on to the strategic port city. Mariupol has been relentlessly hit with Russian shelling for months, with few pauses. Officials estimate more than 20,000 people have been killed there. Evacuations have been sporadic, but four buses of civilians managed to escape yesterday, with another attempt set for today. About a thousand civilians are currently trapped, along with Ukrainian soldiers, at the steel mill. Meanwhile, Russia's offensive in Ukraine's East continues to spread. The Governor of Luhansk said Russian forces now control 80% of the region, one of two that make up the Donbas in Eastern Ukraine. Before Russia invaded, Ukraine's Kyiv government controlled about 60%. Russia has stated that its goal is to control the Donbas, which is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy equipment factories. The United Nations Refugee Agency now says that more than 5 million people have fled Ukraine, a country of 44 million. Many of them, like Mariupol refugee Viktoriya Savyichkina, are in Poland. Taylor Wilson translating for Viktoriya Savyichkina: ""We wanted to go immediately because all the houses were destroyed. We sat in the cellars afraid to go out. Everything was plundered, marauding, people wanted to eat. We also had no water."" Russia says it has presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict. Though, just days ago, Putin said talks were at a dead end. It was not clear when the draft was sent or whether it offered anything new to Ukraine, who offered their own demands last month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, but one of his top advisors said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it. Moscow has long demanded that Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. And Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. The founder and CEO of JustAnswer, a company that sources professional services, advanced the salaries of his nearly 300 employees who live and work in Ukraine, ahead of Russia's invasion there in recent months. And more recently, Andy Kurtzig and his family spent their spring break helping their colleagues on the ground there. Money & Tech Reporter Terry Collins has more. Terry Collins: Their goal is to deliver bags with much needed medical supplies, military gear. That includes body armor, night vision goggles and drones. And the goal, was also for Kurtzig to meet with some of his employees, and let them know that he's more than just their boss, he's their friend and he's going to be willing to do whatever he can to help them. He's still going to continue to pay their salaries, whether if they're in Ukraine or in other parts of Europe. For example, when he went over to the Ukrainian border, he was able to give body armor and other military equipment to one of his workers, who's fighting with the Ukrainian army. So in another instance, he said that he and another JustAnswer executive, they went through hours going through customs and the like, trying to make sure they can get over to certain places. And he said, at one point when they were coming back, that he could hear bombs and things like, that he thought wasn't too far for him, but for him, it was a pretty harrowing experience. But in the end, he said it's all worth it. And he plans to go back again if he can. He normally goes about twice a year, but had some reservations regarding with the conflict. But listening to his daughter, and they had a family meeting, they decided, ""Let's go, let's see what we can do to help."" And so it's one of the many examples that we see of [inaudible 00:10:33], to several tech entrepreneurs who have either employees or companies based in Ukraine, which is a tech hotbed, doing all they can to help out their workers. Kurtzig said, ""This is not about just a war about tanks and bombs, but about freedom and truth."" He said that, ""We're trying to do our part to spread the truth. The more we can all help the better."" So Kurtzig believes that by him going, hopefully he sets an example and maybe other tech entrepreneurs may go that extra step, in addition to giving all the money and resources that they have, to maybe if they can, if they can do so safely, go see their workers. Let them know that you're there for them, and that you care about them. In addition to some of the other hard to find supplies that he and his family brought in, they said they also brought in a truckload of food, bedding and other items for Ukrainian refugees, and delivered a lot of those to a refugee food kitchen and logistics center in Slovakia. And they also visited a refugee center and food operation in Poland. Basically, he was trying to make the most of a week in trying to get out as much supplies that he could, and see as many people as possible, just to let them know that he cares.

Florida's House of Representatives will vote today on legislation that would repeal a 56-year-old law that allows Disney to self-govern its 38 square miles of theme parks and more in Central Florida. And an additional measure would strip Disney of special social media protections as well. The move is seen as punishment by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis for Disney speaking out against the so-called, 'Don't Say Gay' bill. DeSantis signed that legislation into law this month, which states that classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through third grade in the state. The Governor's fight with Disney is unprecedented with the company bringing in $75 billion to the state a year. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Through his own words, we will show how he went from a father to one of the many citizens in Ukraine who have decided to fight back against the Russian invasion.  You can follow his story from the first dispatch he sent when he was with his family and talking about why he decided to fight the Russian invasion to when he reached Kyiv to help train volunteers.  Most of the diary is marked premium for subscribers, but this page will provide previews and a gathering point. You can subscribe here to get full access to the diary and all of USA TODAY's subscriber content.  Illarion has been communicating with me through the Telegram app that has become popular in Ukraine.  His words are haunting and powerful, especially as I listen to his children in the background.  ""What can I tell you about this war? It is difficult to say a couple of words,"" he says. ""I would never ever imagine my four children dropping their toys and running to sit in the thickest doorway in the house because of cruise missiles above our city; ballistic missiles. ""And I would never imagine this and I will never forgive Russia.""  Read: A father decides to fight and protect Ukraine  'It was a horrible feeling to see your country in a state of war' It was 10 p.m. in Kyiv when he sent me his audio message. In this second dispatch, Illarion sounds different. He says he's exhausted emotionally, and barely speaks above a whisper. It is nighttime when he recorded it and he is at a friend's house in the city of Cherkasy, outside of Kyiv. Illarion sounds drained, he pauses often and his voice falters as he tells me that it's his oldest son's birthday and that the child was a ""little upset"" with his father for leaving; he tells me that during the daylong drive, the two men were calling their wives.

Through his own words, we will show how he went from a father to one of the many citizens in Ukraine who have decided to fight back against the Russian invasion.  You can follow his story from the first dispatch he sent when he was with his family and talking about why he decided to fight the Russian invasion to when he reached Kyiv to help train volunteers.  Most of the diary is marked premium for subscribers, but this page will provide previews and a gathering point.

Biden said he will ban Russian ships from U.S. ports, following the European Union and other countries that imposed a similar ban. In the White House's Roosevelt Room, Biden said the military aid will ensure a steady flow of weapons and equipment into Ukraine over the next few weeks and send an unmistakable message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine,"" Biden said. 'Speak softly and carry a large Javelin': Biden unveils latest $800M military aid package. Ukraine updates The latest infusion of security assistance, which matches the amount committed last week, includes 72 howitzers, 72 trucks to tow them, 121 Phoenix Ghost drones, other heavy artillery and 144,000 rounds of ammunition. Biden said the aid will ""further augment Ukraine's ability"" to fight Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas region. “We're in a critical window now of time, where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said. The assistance brings the total U.S. aid to Ukraine during Biden’s presidency to about $4 billion. That includes $3.4 billion since Putin invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Biden said he's nearly exhausted the level of aid authorized by Congress last month and will seek approval of a supplemental budget request. Before his remarks, Biden met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal at the White House. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pushed Western allies, particularly the United States, to provide more aid amid allegations that Putin directed war crimes and genocide.  How much aid has US given to Ukraine? US military aid to Ukraine surpasses $3 billion under Biden. Here's what's been provided Biden said his administration is ""not sitting on"" funds for Ukraine approved by Congress, which are going directly to the ""front lines of freedom."" He said not all assistance is publicized. “Sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well,” Biden said, referring to surface-to-air Javelin missiles and playing off a famous line from President Theodore Roosevelt. Biden announced $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government. Biden pushed back against Putin's claims of victory in the heavily contested Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the Donbas region. ""It’s questionable whether he does control Mariupol,” said Biden, who departed on a presidential swing through Portland, Oregon, and Seattle after his speech. “There’s no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen.” Ukrainians displaced by the war will be allowed to seek temporary refuge in the USA under a program the Biden administration announced Thursday. Biden promised the United States would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled their homeland after it was invaded by Russian forces. Starting next week, U.S. citizens and groups will be able to apply to sponsor Ukrainian refugees under the Uniting for Ukraine program. They can apply through an online portal that will be available on the Department of Homeland Security website starting Monday. Kiev or Kyiv? 'We want to use our own names': Language experts explain importance of Ukrainian cities' spellings Ukrainians who are given permission to travel to the USA under the program will undergo a streamlined approval process that will allow them to live and work here for up to two years. To qualify, they must have been a resident of Ukraine as of Feb. 11 and have a U.S sponsor. They will be required to undergo a background check, pass biometric screenings, complete vaccinations and meet other public health requirements. Sponsors must undergo background screenings to make sure they are able to support the refugees and won’t exploit or abuse them. Biden said the program will complement legal pathways available to Ukrainians, such as immigrant visas and refugee processing, and will provide an expedited channel for Ukrainians who have a U.S. sponsor to secure legal migration from Europe to the USA. ""This program will be fast, it will be streamlined and it will ensure the United States honors its commitment to the people of Ukraine,"" he said. Refugee tracker:Millions of refugees flee Ukraine. Where are they going? The vetting process for refugees is expected to take about a week, said senior officials with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council, who described the program on the condition of anonymity. It has taken weeks for the administration to lay out a plan to accept the refugees – leaving thousands in limbo as they tried to map their next move. The delay led to some Ukrainians heading to the U.S.-Mexican border to seek asylum. Title 42, which allows U.S. border agents to expel asylum seekers to Mexico to prevent the spread of coronavirus, is still in place. There are exceptions to the policy, and some Ukrainians were processed to come to the USA. Ukrainians and southern border:Refugees from Ukraine wait in Tijuana for permission to enter US The United States has processed almost 15,000 undocumented Ukrainian nationals over the past three months, most of them entering the country through the border with Mexico, the homeland security officials said. Last month, 5,071 Ukrainian people were detained at land, sea or air borders, according to data from Customs and Border Protection. That was up from 1,146 Ukrainians who were detained in February. Many of the Ukrainians who were detained last month came through the U.S. southern border. This year, the administration announced deportation protections for Ukrainians already in the USA. The Department of Homeland Security granted temporary protected status to Ukrainians in early March. On Monday, the agency extended eligibility for the program, allowing those who arrived by April 11 to apply for TPS, which allows them to stay for 18 months and apply for work permits. Back into Ukraine:'We believe in the Ukrainian army': Historic flood of refugees slows as some decide to stay put Biden's ban on Russian ships from entering U.S. ports follows a series of escalating economic sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the war in Ukraine. No ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a U.S. port or access U.S. shores, Biden said. Biden said the ban would further deny Russia “the benefits of the international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.” This month, the European Union banned Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing ports in its 27-nation bloc but provided exemptions for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. The United Kingdom and Canada also banned Russian ships from their ports. Joey Garrison and Michael Collins cover the White House. Follow Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison and Collins @mcollinsNEWS.

Justice Department officials announced charges Wednesday against 21 people accused in connection with $149 million in false billings and theft from federal programs related to the government's COVID-19 response. The sweep of suspects from across the country included physicians, marketers and manufacturers of fake vaccination cards along with purveyors of phony cures. Among the defendants: a 53-year-old Colorado man was charged in an alleged scheme to forge hundreds of fake vaccination cards. Some of the cards, the suspect allegedly told an undercover agent, were sold to people headed to the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games last August, including three Olympians.

It's anything but. Russia stopped short of routing hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the strategic city’s giant steel plant. Both Ukraine and President Joe Biden have rejected Putin’s claim of victory. What is clear is that Mariupol’s residents have endured some of the worst atrocities committed by the Russians even as Russia has lost an estimated quarter of its combat forces in Ukraine – troops, aircraft, tanks ships and other equipment – since the war began Feb. 24. Though Putin was forced to retreat from his goal of taking Kyiv, he’s pushing for territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Military victories could give him the stronger hand he needs to wrest concessions in a peace negotiation, or at least allow him to save face at home.

""It is CDC's continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health,"" the agency said in a Wednesday statement. ""CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary. CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC’s legal authority to protect public health."" The decision has prompted the Justice Department to immediately file a notice of appeal in line with its promise Tuesday to appeal the judge’s ruling based on the CDC’s decision. U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said this week that the CDC failed to justify the order and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures. In response, the CDC said Monday it would no longer enforce its mask requirement on mass transportation systems, though masks were still recommended in indoor public settings. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki said an appeal is needed not just to preserve the 15-day extension of the mandate but to preserve ""CDC authority over the long-term"" in case the pandemic worsens again. ""Because as we've noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs of the pandemic. And we certainly want the CDC to continue to have this authority.""

The latest infusion of security assistance, which matches the amount committed last week, includes 72 howitzers, 72 trucks to tow them, 121 Phoenix Ghost drones, other heavy artillery and 144,000 rounds of ammunition. Biden said the aid will ""further augment Ukraine's ability"" to fight Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas region. “We're in a critical window now of time, where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said.

""It is CDC's continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health,"" the agency said in a Wednesday statement. ""CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary. CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC’s legal authority to protect public health."" The decision has prompted the Justice Department to immediately file a notice of appeal in line with its promise Tuesday to appeal the judge’s ruling based on the CDC’s decision. U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said this week that the CDC failed to justify the order and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures. In response, the CDC said Monday it would no longer enforce its mask requirement on mass transportation systems, though masks were still recommended in indoor public settings. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki said an appeal is needed not just to preserve the 15-day extension of the mandate but to preserve ""CDC authority over the long-term"" in case the pandemic worsens again. ""Because as we've noted from here, we expect there to be ups and downs of the pandemic. And we certainly want the CDC to continue to have this authority.""

Her appearance on the Grammy Awards alongside longtime peer Joni Mitchell was partially to introduce their mutual musical pal Brandi Carlile but also to acknowledge Raitt as a recipient of the vaunted lifetime achievement award. Billboard honored her with an Icon Award in March, and last week, Raitt’s 1989 album that spawned her career resurgence, “Nick of Time,” was added to the National Recording Registry. (She calls the album’s success “life-changing.”) At 72, Raitt has earned accolades undeniably deserved for a career stretching 50 years. But she isn’t allowing plaudits to derail her ambition. On Friday, Raitt releases “Just Like That,” her first album in six years. She recently launched a new tour – NRBQ, Lucinda Williams and Mavis Staples rotate as openers – and her set list, while peppered with fan favorites including “Something to Talk About,” “Love Sneakin’ Up on You” and her devastating version of “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” draws heavily from her sturdy new work. Joni Mitchell back onstage: The singing legend reemerged for her MusiCares tribute Calling from Rochester, New York, on the eve of the kickoff of her eight-month tour, the engaging Raitt delved into some of the songs on “Just Like That,” her respect for her friend the late John Prine, and why she is “heartsick” about the war in Ukraine. Question: In the last couple of months, you’ve been named a Billboard Icon and received a Grammy lifetime achievement award. Does the recognition still mean something? Bonnie Raitt: Absolutely. The recognition of my fans still coming out after 50 years is a thrill, but I wasn’t expecting to get these awards, so it was a delight. I still do this for the fun of it and the respect and the joy that the fans continue to give me. Having said that, I was really honored to be chosen for these. Q: This is your first new album in six years. Between your song ""Livin' for the Ones"" and a cover of Toots and the Maytals (“Love So Strong”), were you thinking of your good friend John Prine, who died of COVID-19 in 2020, and Toots Hibbert, who also died in 2020 after being hospitalized with COVID-19-like symptoms? Raitt: The first two nights of doing warm-up gigs for this tour in California and Nevada, I sang (Prine’s) “Angel From Montgomery” for the first time for a live audience since his passing, and it was very emotional. But in singing the Toots song and John’s song, it made them alive for me.  Q: “Waitin’ for You to Blow” is interesting in that it’s sung from the perspective of addiction.  Raitt: It’s alluding to the idea of recovery as an ongoing thing and to take stock of your behavior, but specifically the ways we delude ourselves. Like when the devil raises on your shoulder to tell you to have that piece of pie or tell someone their email went into a spam folder even though you forgot to read it. People think recovery has to do with not drinking or using or sex or gambling, but it’s really the way you have to take accountability for your behavior.   Spring album bounty: From Miranda to Hanson to Florence to Harry Q: Your guitar playing is as sharp as ever. How often do you play if you’re not recording or touring? Raitt: I never play except when I’m going to be recording or writing. I love to play my acoustic guitar in my house and get the shape of what a song is going to be, but I don’t fire up the electric very much without the band. The less I practice, the more fresh it feels. Q: As someone who has always been very visibly involved in numerous causes, this devastation in Ukraine must be hitting you hard. Raitt: I’m as sickened and as worried as I’ve ever been. I haven’t been this heartsick in many years. I’m sending as much help as I can. I’m on my knees. I’ll continue to dedicate the shows to Ukraine because they’re going to need our prayers.  Q: You’re going to be on the road through November. How much did you miss it? Raitt: What I missed the most was waking up in a different city and knowing I have to prove myself every night. I love traveling, I love visiting other cities. I have my favorite parks and restaurants. The sad thing about this tour is I can’t see family and friends along the way because I’m in a COVID bubble. But whatever it takes to stay safe. I’m just grateful this month is happening. Jewel speaks: 'This business is notoriously unkind to women as they get older'"

Alexander Skarsgård plays a 10th-century Viking seeking bloody justice in a period revenge fantasy, while Nicolas Cage plays a fictionalized version of himself – and pays meta tribute to the Cage film canon – opposite Pedro Pascal in a new action comedy. Youngsters will get a kick out of an animated comedy featuring a bunch of villainous animals who try being good for a change, and CNN premieres a very timely documentary about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Here's a guide to new movies that will satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their on-demand debut:   'The Northman':Why the bonkers Viking epic just had to have 'a naked sword fight on a volcano' Director Robert Eggers (""The Witch,"" ""The Lighthouse"") doesn't make bad movies and this one is his most accessible to date, with a very ripped Skarsgård starring as a Viking berserker who was supposed to rule an island kingdom but now is out for vengeance on the uncle (Claes Bang) who killed his father (Ethan Hawke). The violent epic navigates familiar narrative territory but is exquisitely crafted and absolutely nuts, with dark fantasy elements, buckets of blood, twisty betrayals, naked sword fighting and a low-key fabulous turn by Nicole Kidman as Skarsgård's onscreen mom. Where to watch: In theaters Cage plays eccentric movie star ""Nick Cage,"" who's had it with acting when he gets embroiled in a political kidnapping plot and works undercover for the feds in Spain by getting close to a Cage fanboy (a standout Pascal) they think is an international arms dealer. It's more conventional than it sounds on paper (though Cage does make out with his ""Wild at Heart""-era self) but it's an entertaining romp that works best when Cage and Pascal's characters get to know each other and watch ""Paddington 2"" together for a bromance to remember. 'Not the bees!':Nicolas Cage's grandpa inspired his bizarre 'Wicker Man' helmet and line While the animated comedy doesn't do anything vastly different from similar ""baddies with a heart of gold"" films (see: ""Megamind"" and ""Despicable Me""), the ""Reservoir Dogs""-as-animals vibe gives it a fun energy. The bank-robbing crew of Mr. Wolf (voiced by Sam Rockwell), Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina), Mr. Snake (Marc Maron), Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson) and Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos) get caught trying to steal a valuable trophy and figure out it feels good to do right and be loved. Set in 1961 England and based on a true story, the feel-good British dramedy stars Jim Broadbent as an aging taxi driver put on trial for stealing Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from London's National Gallery. The movie gets into the twists and turns of the intriguing story, with Broadbent inhabiting a charming bloke who just wants to help people and Helen Mirren as the loving but embattled wife who's tired of her husband's troublemaking activism. Daniel Roher's excellent documentary (which won audience awards at Sundance Film Festival) is essential viewing for those after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The film is a stranger-than-fiction deep dive into the life and almost-death of Navalny, charismatic dissident and President Vladimir Putin's chief political rival. The film features an entertaining phone call between Navalny and one of the guys who tried to poison him, but it works on an emotional level chronicling a man who has gone to extreme lengths to better his country.  Where to watch: CNN and CNN+ (both on Sunday)  A blender of so many movies it'll put your brain on ""frappe,"" the thriller features the ""Game of Thrones"" star as a burlesque dancer/author who goes on the run with a boy (Dean Scott Vasquez) and his dog after the kid's family is killed by her unhinged crime-boss ex (Sam Worthington).

Where to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Vudu In this unnerving little gem that worked the film festival circuit last year, impressive newcomer Anna Cobb stars as a teen girl who isolates herself in her attic bedroom, taking on the challenges of an online role-playing horror game and going down a rabbit hole full of psychological danger.

In an update posted Friday, the ministry says that ""a full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness."" Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted victory in the battle for Mariupol Thursday, even as hundreds of Ukrainian troops hold out in and around the Azovstal plant. President Joe Biden pushed back on Putin's claim, saying there isn't evidence yet of a Russian win. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said in order to cover up ""military crimes,"" Russian troops have buried as many as 9,000 civilians killed in the conflict in a nearby mass grave. ""The greatest war crime of the 21st century has been committed in Mariupol,"" he said.  Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast:  The funeral for Patrick Lyoya, the Congolese immigrant fatally shot by a Michigan police officer April 4, will take place Friday in the city of Grand Rapids. The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy, and Sharpton said his National Action Network is covering burial and funeral costs. Lyoya was fatally shot during a struggle with a Grand Rapids police officer following a traffic stop. Released video footage showed that Lyoya was shot while facedown on the ground, sparking protests. An independent autopsy report stated he was shot in the back of the head, family attorneys said. Police have not revealed the identity of the officer.   Friday is Earth Day, with rallies, protests and other events expected through the weekend. Earth Day's global organizer, EarthDay.org, has given this year's holiday the theme of ""Invest In Our Planet,"" and it will present a livestream of the Earth Day Climate Action Summit Friday. The annual observance spotlighting environmental issues comes just weeks after the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report warning that rapid mitigation measures are needed to avoid unsustainable global warming. Although Earth Day is not a federal holiday in the United States, Americans have observed it for 52 years. More than 1 billion people worldwide mark the day by working to instigate climate policy change and shift everyday human behavior. President Joe Biden will spend Earth Day in Seattle, speaking about a need to bolster the nation's resilience in the face of threats like wildfires, and a need to rapidly deploy clean energy, the White House said.  More help is on the way to contain one of the biggest blazes near Flagstaff, Arizona, which is expected to keep growing Friday. Spirits were lifted Thursday as helicopters for the first time were able to start dropping water on the flames, but ""there is high confidence that a widespread extreme and catastrophic fire weather event will occur on Friday,"" Santa Fe National Forest officials said. About 30 structures have been destroyed, but it's still unclear how many were homes, the county sheriff's office said. The 32-square-mile blaze is one of a half-dozen major wildfires that have raced across Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters have warned that warm weather, little to no precipitation and spring winds create a dangerous recipe for wildfires. The elements are ""pretty much on steroids in the atmosphere"" for Friday said Scott Overpeck with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The path to the 2022 NBA Finals is now more rocky for the two teams who matched up in the 2021 NBA Finals. Last season's Western Conference champs and this season's No. 1 overall seed, the Phoenix Suns, lost leading scorer Devin Booker to a strained right hamstring against the New Orleans Pelicans Tuesday night. In the Eastern Conference, last season's NBA champs, the Milwaukee Bucks lost their second-leading scorer Khris Middleton to a left-knee injury Wednesday night against the Chicago Bulls. Both players won't play Friday and they both could be out for weeks. Making matters worse, both teams fell in their respective Game 2s and find themselves tied 1-1 seeking to win back home court advantage Friday night. The Bucks will make the trip to play Game 3 in Chicago against the Bulls (ABC, 8:30 p.m. ET) and the Suns will travel to New Orleans to try to take Game 3 against the Pelicans (ESPN, 9:30 p.m. ET). Friday's action begins with the Atlanta Hawks, down 0-2, hosting the Miami Heat (ESPN, 7 p.m. ET). Contributing: The Associated Press"

Lyoya was fatally shot during a struggle with a Grand Rapids police officer following a traffic stop. Released video footage showed that Lyoya was shot while facedown on the ground, sparking protests. An independent autopsy report stated he was shot in the back of the head, family attorneys said. Police have not revealed the identity of the officer.   Friday is Earth Day, with rallies, protests and other events expected through the weekend. Earth Day's global organizer, EarthDay.org, has given this year's holiday the theme of ""Invest In Our Planet,"" and it will present a livestream of the Earth Day Climate Action Summit Friday. The annual observance spotlighting environmental issues comes just weeks after the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report warning that rapid mitigation measures are needed to avoid unsustainable global warming. Although Earth Day is not a federal holiday in the United States, Americans have observed it for 52 years. More than 1 billion people worldwide mark the day by working to instigate climate policy change and shift everyday human behavior. President Joe Biden will spend Earth Day in Seattle, speaking about a need to bolster the nation's resilience in the face of threats like wildfires, and a need to rapidly deploy clean energy, the White House said.  More help is on the way to contain one of the biggest blazes near Flagstaff, Arizona, which is expected to keep growing Friday. Spirits were lifted Thursday as helicopters for the first time were able to start dropping water on the flames, but ""there is high confidence that a widespread extreme and catastrophic fire weather event will occur on Friday,"" Santa Fe National Forest officials said. About 30 structures have been destroyed, but it's still unclear how many were homes, the county sheriff's office said. The 32-square-mile blaze is one of a half-dozen major wildfires that have raced across Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters have warned that warm weather, little to no precipitation and spring winds create a dangerous recipe for wildfires. The elements are ""pretty much on steroids in the atmosphere"" for Friday said Scott Overpeck with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The path to the 2022 NBA Finals is now more rocky for the two teams who matched up in the 2021 NBA Finals. Last season's Western Conference champs and this season's No. 1 overall seed, the Phoenix Suns, lost leading scorer Devin Booker to a strained right hamstring against the New Orleans Pelicans Tuesday night. In the Eastern Conference, last season's NBA champs, the Milwaukee Bucks lost their second-leading scorer Khris Middleton to a left-knee injury Wednesday night against the Chicago Bulls. Both players won't play Friday and they both could be out for weeks. Making matters worse, both teams fell in their respective Game 2s and find themselves tied 1-1 seeking to win back home court advantage Friday night. The Bucks will make the trip to play Game 3 in Chicago against the Bulls (ABC, 8:30 p.m. ET) and the Suns will travel to New Orleans to try to take Game 3 against the Pelicans (ESPN, 9:30 p.m. ET). Friday's action begins with the Atlanta Hawks, down 0-2, hosting the Miami Heat (ESPN, 7 p.m. ET). Contributing: The Associated Press"

CHERNIHIV, Ukraine – The sign on the road leading into this war-battered city says ""Welcome to Hell"" and inside a bombed-out hospital, we begin to see the horror of Russia’s attacks. A boy injured by bombs lies in a bed, his body broken, no painkillers to ease his suffering, his eyes glassy. A catheter snakes from beneath a brown floral blanket covering the narrow bed, emptying into a glass jar on the floor. The boy, Bagdan, is 13. His anxious mother paces the room, carrying a secret she hasn’t yet shared with him: The bombs killed his father. Nearby, another mother wipes away tears as she sits with her bedridden daughter, her legs broken by Russian bombs. Hand-drawn pictures by other children staying inside this powerless hospital basement decorate the walls. But they can't hide the grim reality of war outside. Bullet holes mark the hospital’s front windows and military vehicles patrol outside. Chernihiv is about 100 miles north of Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv and just 50 miles south of the Russian border. Fighting here has been intense for weeks, and I have accompanied the nonprofit rescue group Team Humanity as it chanced a dash into the city to extract women and children fleeing to safety. These children will have to stay behind because the group isn't set up to evacuate the injured. Mines and debris litter the streets outside, making travel dangerous. Russian bombs have destroyed much of the city and the smell of destruction fills the air, along with occasional fires. Burned-out and blown-up vehicles line the streets in this city of 285,000, along with a charred tank. Team Humanity is based in neighboring Moldova’s capital of Chisinau, and has made multiple trips into Ukraine, delivering food and medical supplies along the southern coast, from Odesa to Mykolaiv. Team Humanity’s co-founder, Salam Aldeen, has decided this time to plunge deep into the country, far closer to the frontlines than he’s ever taken his convoy of buses and vans. Aldeen is a veteran of refugee rescues, from Syria to Afghanistan, and his network of contacts across Ukraine have assured him a quick dash into Chernihiv will be safe enough. After bedding down the night before in an abandoned hospital outside Kyiv, we wake at 4 a.m. to get the convoy to Chernihiv moving by dawn: two 60-person buses and three Sprinter vans that can each carry about 20 people. “If you have to go to the bathroom, go,” Aldeen tells a handful of drivers and volunteers as we load up. “We are not stopping again before entering Chernihiv. It’s too dangerous. The Russians are everywhere.” Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, nearly 5 million people have fled Ukraine, many of them from the eastern areas near Chernihiv or Kyiv. Under martial law, men of fighting age are banned from leaving Ukraine, so the refugees have almost exclusively been women and children. Most have left behind everything they know for an uncertain future and the chance for greater safety in Europe or the United States. As the sun rises, we drive past largely unattended farms that, under normal times, would be filled with tractors and workers preparing for the spring planting season. Each spring, Ukraine produces wheat and corn and sunflower oil that get shipped across Europe and Africa, sustaining life for millions. But these are not normal times, and the fields are bare. Yesterday we passed the capital of Kyiv, its six-lane highways empty of traffic. It’s all open road but painstaking going, with frequent military checkpoints. Russian saboteurs are a constant worry for the Ukrainians, and uniformed soldiers board our buses regularly, checking our passports and other documents. The checkpoints slow our progress, urgency instilled by the coming sunset and darkness, when curfew sets in each night. Today, we wind along narrow muddy roads, past tall pines and unattended farmland, and snake through piles of sand set out to slow the approach of Russian invaders on the outskirts of Chernihiv. Approaching the city, we leave behind the 60-person buses and shift into the smaller supply vans, and one by one, the Sprinters are guided over a makeshift bridge by a Ukrainian soldier. Right now, the city’s main arteries are closed, and soldiers guide aid vehicles in and passenger cars out. Entering the city proper, I see bombed-out buildings lining the street, and elderly people riding bikes past unmanned checkpoints. It very much feels like a scene from Europe during WWII, right down to the trenches dug into the landscape. Mines dot the roads, their smooth metal casings about the size of dinner plates. Locals tell me the Russians left them behind as they retreated days ago, and no one has removed them. Instead, pedestrians and bike riders wind past the mines and craters left by explosions, past trees sheared off 20 feet above the ground, and flipped and charred cars littering the roadsides. Arriving at the hospital to collect refugees, Aldeen begins to fret: Only three women and three children are prepared to leave. He has seats for 160 refugees, and he’s frustrated he didn’t arrive sooner. He blames himself – it’s been a Herculean effort to get the buses to Chernihiv and took longer than he hoped. It’s a hard pill to swallow, but this is war and so a new plan is born – instead of heading straight for the safety of Moldova, we’ll divert to Mykolaiv, a city from which Team Humanity has already extracted hundreds of refugees. We’re running late and darkness is coming. Calling in a police escort, Aldee shepherds the vans back out of the city, collects the buses and hurries the convoy back to the safehouse at the abandoned hospital outside Kyiv. Team Humanity asked that USA TODAY not reveal its specific location over fears it would be targeted by Russians. As we get going, Team Humanity volunteer Andreas Bauchy asks me if I heard the Russian artillery shelling last night – he recognizes the sound from his time in the Danish military, serving in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. Like some of the other men, I slept on a mattress in the hospital hallway, and the six refugees slept in the few rooms available. Unlike him, I slept through it. After another early morning departure, we roll past Odesa and approach Mykolaiv. I visited this area a week earlier and recent Russian attacks are apparent. There’s a larger Ukrainian military presence, more checkpoints and more scrutiny of each passenger. My press credentials are checked frequently and at one checkpoint, a soldier orders me to show what photos I’ve taken on my cellphone. Ukrainian authorities have permitted journalists to cover the war, but they strictly limit the publication of any images deemed tactically sensitive. A few days earlier, Ukrainian military authorities deported a Dutch journalist from this area after he posted a video on Twitter of a Russian strike on an oil refinery. The soldier doesn’t check my cameras, but he orders me to delete the maps I’ve been using to track our journey – maps I’ve been sending to my editors so they can monitor my safety from 5,000 miles away. Rolling deeper into Mykolaiv, we arrive at the evacuee pickup location. The pickup spot is in a parking lot outside a department store near the center of town, packed with cars and about 300 people, their bags stacked and waiting for Team Humanity’s buses. A week ago, the team extracted about 70 people. But today, even with the big buses, there are more people than seats, and the sense of urgency is higher, the danger more real. Crying women and children say goodbye to husbands, boyfriends, fathers, brothers, friends and elderly parents, possibly for the last time, to board a bus and drive west, destination unknown. As the buses pull away, a man salutes his daughter and his grandson. Now headed west toward the safety of Moldova, we pass more military checkpoints, including near the oil refinery bombed by the Russians a few days earlier. For weeks, Ukrainians believed Russia would invade from the ocean, and soldiers mined the beaches and deployed dozens of tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons along the Black Sea coastline. Worried Odessans watched as Russian warships menaced the coast, occasionally shelling the cities and key infrastructure. From Mykolaiv to Odesa is about 80 miles, but the difference between the two cities is night and day. While Mykolaiv feels like a war zone, Odesa has largely escaped the fighting and destruction. Although the intersections and streets are filled with soldiers and artillery stations, people still go about their business as usual. Street markets are open, cafes too. Traffic fills the streets, although backups occur at the checkpoints. From Odesa, the checkpoints dwindle as we drive west toward Moldova and the safety of Europe. The drive from Mykolaiv to our destination of Chisinau, Moldova, should have taken us about 4.5 hours. Instead, it takes us 12 with no bathroom breaks or stops to stretch legs. Finally, our convoy reaches the Ukraine-Moldova border and the promise of safety. But not everyone makes it across. To leave Ukraine, border guards inspect everyone’s passports and documents. And one young man, who appears to be 16, is actually 20. He’s traveling with his elderly grandmother, helping her board the bus and cope with the long, exhausting drive. Border guards remove both the young man and his grandmother, and they negotiate for several hours. The elderly woman begins having a panic attack as the guards question her and her grandson and a medic hands her a pill to reduce her anxiety, to calm her rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure. The grandmother boards back alone, her grandson in custody. He’ll be sent back to Mykolaiv, back east toward the Russians. His grandmother heads west toward an uncertain future."

If the city were to fall, Russia would have full control of the Ukrainian seacoast from Rostov in the east along the shores of the Sea of Azov and then on to the outskirts of Odesa. This would clear the path for easier logistics support for Russian forces in the south and further degrade Ukrainian efforts to defend Odesa.  Biden wrong about inflation:Don't count on him being right now. The brave Ukrainian resistance cannot be maintained indefinitely in the absence of food, water and replenishment of ammunition, so the clock is ticking. Meanwhile, a substantial number of Russian forces are being freed up to move north, reinforcing Russian efforts to encircle and annihilate Ukrainian forces holding back the main Russian effort in Donbas.  The implications of the battle of Mariupol for both Russia and Ukraine are operationally significant, and for Ukraine the battle and 100,000 innocent lives hang in the balance. At the strategic level, Russia is also sending a message to Ukraine and the West: Whatever the problems in the north around Kyiv, Russia will use the means necessary, and suffer the losses required, to attain its objectives in Ukraine. A city of more than 400,000 has been deliberately erased through heavy and indiscriminate use of firepower and total disregard of international law and humanitarian conventions. Humanitarian relief convoys were blocked, humanitarian exit corridors have been mined, areas of refuge deliberately targeted and nominally agreed civilian evacuations often fired upon, all part of a psychological campaign of terror. RIP CNN+:Might I suggest CNN-, HuluMeh and HBOmin – streaming services that provide less In taking over areas of the city, Russia has shown it will execute a ruthless campaign of “filtration,” abducting the civilian population to “filter” out and murder potential opponents and forcibly resettle others into Russia or perhaps sell thousands of young women into human trafficking. A mass grave site is now seen in satellite imagery. Here are some larger efforts that failed thus far to stop the war and save the city: United Nations General Assembly votes to condemn Russia, multiple investigations of potential Russian war crimes, and heavy and escalating economic sanctions on Russia. Not even Russia’s initial failures around Kyiv, poor Russian morale in some units, Russian intelligence failures, visits by Western leaders to Kyiv and appeals to Putin himself have persuaded the Russian leader to negotiate an end the conflict and release his nation's grip on Mariupol.  The messages to the West should be clear. First, the outcome in Ukraine will be determined largely by “the facts on the ground.”  Modulating Western military assistance to suit Putin flirts with strategic failure. Ukraine must be given the armaments necessary not only to resist but actually to defeat the Russian invasion, or there will be more Mariupols.  America is better than its worst parts:Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump don't define us. Second, despite escalating sanctions, time is not always on the side of Ukraine and the West – Putin has shown a Stalinesque capacity to shrug off defeats and disloyalty, while Ukraine’s fierce spirit of resistance is under daily assault. Russian losses around Kyiv have not prevented Putin from throwing more forces into the battles in Donbas. Russia’s war industries are far more robust, particularly with the prospect of covert Chinese support, than Ukraine’s and are operating from sanctuary, while Russia is tightening down Ukraine’s lifelines to the West.  And as the West has escalated sanctions, with increasing difficulty, Putin has ramped up his threats against the West. These threats have deterred the West from providing Ukraine sufficient, timely military support to compel Russia to negotiate.  In fact, Western worries and warnings about Putin’s red lines – and the possibility that he will escalate to the use of nuclear weapons – have fed into Putin’s sophisticated psychological campaign against NATO and the United States, rather than rallying opposition to Russia and Putin’s aims. LEADER:Zelenskyy's path from comedy to tragedy: Can he save Ukraine from Russian war invaders? Third, the West’s ambivalence in responding to Russian threats is weakening American credibility on a global scale, as leaders in the Middle East, Asia and Africa hedge their bets on the outcome of the struggle in Ukraine, refusing to assist and support the United States.  Never forget that Putin’s initial, announced aims went beyond Ukraine to roll back NATO membership for Eastern Europe, and by doing so set the conditions for NATO’s eventual collapse. And with that would go seven decades of American leadership in Europe – weakening our ability to manage peacefully the ascent of China.  NATO’s self-imposed red lines against support to Ukraine contradict almost 30 years of NATO leadership in providing regional stability to Europe. This is eroding confidence in NATO itself – and the world sees this. Austin Bogues:Zelenskyy makes a bold challenge to Biden. Can America be the leader for peace? Make no mistake: The West is not yet winning against Putin’s attack on NATO and the rules-based international order. The destruction of Mariupol was not inevitable. With adequate armor and artillery, Ukraine could have attacked and broken the siege; with more air power, Ukraine could have blown apart and run off the besieging Russian forces; with more detailed and timely U.S.-provided intelligence, Ukraine could have used its relatively meager military resources more effectively.  The overriding lesson is that Western policy, led by the United States, must be more proactive than reactionary, and more grounded in shorter-term military than in longer-term economic measures.  If we seek the surest and most rapid end to this tragic struggle at the negotiating table, now is the time to tell Putin, “You will not win,” and to provide Ukraine the means to relieve the siege of Mariupol and make Putin’s military defeat in Ukraine a reality.  Retired Gen.

Second, despite escalating sanctions, time is not always on the side of Ukraine and the West – Putin has shown a Stalinesque capacity to shrug off defeats and disloyalty, while Ukraine’s fierce spirit of resistance is under daily assault. Russian losses around Kyiv have not prevented Putin from throwing more forces into the battles in Donbas. Russia’s war industries are far more robust, particularly with the prospect of covert Chinese support, than Ukraine’s and are operating from sanctuary, while Russia is tightening down Ukraine’s lifelines to the West.  And as the West has escalated sanctions, with increasing difficulty, Putin has ramped up his threats against the West. These threats have deterred the West from providing Ukraine sufficient, timely military support to compel Russia to negotiate.  In fact, Western worries and warnings about Putin’s red lines – and the possibility that he will escalate to the use of nuclear weapons – have fed into Putin’s sophisticated psychological campaign against NATO and the United States, rather than rallying opposition to Russia and Putin’s aims. LEADER:Zelenskyy's path from comedy to tragedy: Can he save Ukraine from Russian war invaders? Third, the West’s ambivalence in responding to Russian threats is weakening American credibility on a global scale, as leaders in the Middle East, Asia and Africa hedge their bets on the outcome of the struggle in Ukraine, refusing to assist and support the United States.  Never forget that Putin’s initial, announced aims went beyond Ukraine to roll back NATO membership for Eastern Europe, and by doing so set the conditions for NATO’s eventual collapse. And with that would go seven decades of American leadership in Europe – weakening our ability to manage peacefully the ascent of China.  NATO’s self-imposed red lines against support to Ukraine contradict almost 30 years of NATO leadership in providing regional stability to Europe. This is eroding confidence in NATO itself – and the world sees this. Austin Bogues:Zelenskyy makes a bold challenge to Biden. Can America be the leader for peace? Make no mistake: The West is not yet winning against Putin’s attack on NATO and the rules-based international order. The destruction of Mariupol was not inevitable. With adequate armor and artillery, Ukraine could have attacked and broken the siege; with more air power, Ukraine could have blown apart and run off the besieging Russian forces; with more detailed and timely U.S.-provided intelligence, Ukraine could have used its relatively meager military resources more effectively.  The overriding lesson is that Western policy, led by the United States, must be more proactive than reactionary, and more grounded in shorter-term military than in longer-term economic measures.  If we seek the surest and most rapid end to this tragic struggle at the negotiating table, now is the time to tell Putin, “You will not win,” and to provide Ukraine the means to relieve the siege of Mariupol and make Putin’s military defeat in Ukraine a reality.  Retired Gen.

Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know, Friday the 22nd of April 2022. Today, Happy Earth Day, plus how Americans are swiping credit cards more frequently and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  ♦ Happy Earth Day. Rallies, protests, and other events are expected today and through the weekend as part of the annual observance of environmental issues. According to earthday.org, this year's theme is Invest In Our Planet. Earth Day 2022 comes just weeks after the United Nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change published a report warning that major action is needed immediately, to avoid unsustainable global warming. The panel's co-chair, Hans-Otto Pörtner, said waiting is not an option. Hans-Otto Pörtner: Based on the impacts we are seeing, based on the risks that are projected, every bit of warming matters. And the longer you wait, and the longer you follow the illusion that you have the option to make choices in with respect of not doing something, the more you will pay later. The report found that current policy to try and curb global warming is not enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists believe doing so is key to preventing catastrophe. The report found that total net greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, during the years 2010 to 2019. The rate of growth was lower than between 2000 and 2009, but average annual emissions were higher than in any decade on record. A previous IPCC report also found that wealthier countries are disproportionately responsible for more emissions than developing ones, even though developing countries are experiencing more severe climate impacts. Some of the work being done to help us better understand our planet, and what needs to happen to fix it, comes from NASA. Karen St. Germain is the head of NASA's Earth Science Division. Karen St. Germain: NASA has been observing the Earth's system for decades using that unique vantage point of space to understand how our oceans and land and atmosphere, and even the polar regions, are working as a system and how they're changing over time. And over the last 50 years, our observations of our home planet have shown that our atmosphere is warming, our oceans are warming, and that's having a lot of impact on the global system. Ever since that famous Earthrise photo during the Apollo era, NASA has been taking that same technology, that same scientific expertise, and turning it back to understand our home planet. The entire ecosystem of Earth observation has really accelerated just in the last five or six years. When we talk about how Earth's climate is changing, it might be easy to feel despair, but I really feel hopeful because I think the understanding we get from our satellite based systems, the way we see Earth as a system, gives us the information we need to make different decisions to actually manage what's ahead. So I think the science and technology can really help us manage in the future, and I think people should be hopeful about the future. For more on some of the solutions to our climate crisis, check out our April 12th episode of 5 Things, with reporter Elizabeth Weise. As for Earth Day, it's not recognized as a federal holiday in the US, but Americans around the country have observed it for 52 years, as do more than a billion people worldwide. Today, President Joe Biden will spend the day in the Pacific Northwest, announcing new legislation to protect old growth forests from wildfires and climate change. Without stimulus checks and a lapse in monthly child tax credit payments, Americans in dire financial situations are swiping credit cards more frequently than a year ago. Personal Finance and Markets reporter Elisabeth Buchwald explains. Elisabeth Buchwald: We're starting to see that people who are having trouble paying bills are actually using their credit cards at higher rates than they did last year. And it's an important to keep in mind that, last year, inflation was about three times smaller than what it is right now. So people right now are turning to credit cards because they're most likely having trouble paying these bills, and it's easier to swipe a card as opposed to taking the cash out of your account if you don't have it. Now, the danger, of course, is not paying back that credit card bill on time means that you're probably going to be racking up credit card debt. And they're going to keep tacking on interest rates that are higher and higher, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. So when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, which they said they're going to do six more times this year, they already did it once earlier this year, and each time they do that, it becomes more expensive to take on debt in all forms. So be it a mortgage, be it a loan, but credit card debt is typically the most expensive one, the interest rates on that are the highest. And they've already started to go up a bit just from the one rate hike that we saw. And the more you sit on that, the more expensive it's going to be, just because of these rate hikes that the Fed is doing. And banks and credit card companies to be competitive, they have to match that essentially. For more, head to USATODAY.com/money. New satellite images appear to show mass graves near Mariupol, Ukraine. Local officials have accused Russia of burying up to 9,000 Ukrainian civilians to hide the slaughter taking place there in recent months. Images came out just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory yesterday in the battle for Mariupol, that's despite some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters still inside a steel mill complex there. But Putin ordered to blockade it instead of storming it. Britain's defense ministry said that move is likely to free up Russian forces for other fights in Eastern Ukraine. Russia has not commented on the satellite images of graves in Mariupol. Previously when mass graves and hundreds of dead civilians were found in suburbs around Kyiv, Russian officials denied that their soldiers killed civilians, and accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. In Mariupol, limited evacuations have continued by bus this week. Some 80 people made it to the city of Zaporizhzhia yesterday, out of some 1,500 who expected to leave, according to the Red Cross. And Russian officials reportedly even pulled some people off the buses. Evacuee Yuriy Lulac described the scene back home. Taylor Wilson translating for Yuriy Lulac: ""Hell is what's happening there, it's not possible to just retell it. Russians are killing people for nothing. If the world doesn't take measures, Zaporizhzhia will be the same. Something needs to be done, as soon as possible."" At least two Russian attacks yesterday hit Zaporizhzhia, though no one was injured. Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 people have been killed in Mariupol, and about 100,000 people are estimated to remain with little food, water, heat, or other resources. Mariupol had a pre-war population of 430,000. After a federal judge's ruling this week removing mask mandates on planes, the largest airlines in the country say they will not require them anymore. And they add that ventilation systems on board make transmission of COVID-19 difficult. Graphics editor George Petras has more. George Petras: Aircraft ventilation systems vary somewhat by manufacturer, but they're essentially engineered the same way. Now we drew from Boeing for our explainer. The aircraft's jet engines power its ventilation system. Now, in simple terms, outside air is circulated into the aircraft where it's cleaned by HEPA filters. That's an acronym for a high-efficiency particulate air filter. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency says these filters remove at least 99.8% of dust, mold, bacteria, and airborne particles. HEPA filters also catch the particles that contain coronaviruses. Now, after being filtered, the air is pumped to overhead ceiling ducts and then downward into the cabin, where other vents near the floor siphon it out. About half of the air is discharged from the aircraft, the other half is mixed with fresh air, filtered, and recirculated inside the plane. Now, there is a catch. The aircraft's main engines must be operating to power the ventilation system. Now that means the plane must be in flight. If not in flight, commercial jets have an onboard auxiliary power unit that can be used to operate the system while the plane is on the ground. Now, fresh air can also be pumped in from an outside air compressor. Now, various medical studies say aircraft ventilation systems are highly efficient, but they still recommend that air travelers wear masks for extra protection. In comparing aircraft to buildings such as offices or stores, it really depends on the building itself. Newer buildings usually have more efficient air exchange and filtration systems. Now, building owners can upgrade their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to accommodate HEPA filters, and they can also do things like increase natural ventilation. But aircraft cabins have an advantage over office spaces because all the passengers are facing forward the same way. Passenger movement is restricted, no socializing, seat backs serve as air barriers, at least partially, the airflow is constant from the top of the cabin to the bottom, and the cabin air is filtered as we've described. You can check out a visual explainer of plane ventilation systems with a link in today's show description. A large wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona is expected to keep growing today. About 30 structures have already been destroyed, and Santa Fe National Forest officials expect a potentially widespread and catastrophic fire weather event today. The 32 square mile blaze is one of a half dozen major wildfires in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters warn that warm weather, little to no precipitation and spring winds create a dangerous recipe for wildfires. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Rallies, protests, and other events are expected today and through the weekend as part of the annual observance of environmental issues. According to earthday.org, this year's theme is Invest In Our Planet. Earth Day 2022 comes just weeks after the United Nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change published a report warning that major action is needed immediately, to avoid unsustainable global warming. The panel's co-chair, Hans-Otto Pörtner, said waiting is not an option. Hans-Otto Pörtner: Based on the impacts we are seeing, based on the risks that are projected, every bit of warming matters. And the longer you wait, and the longer you follow the illusion that you have the option to make choices in with respect of not doing something, the more you will pay later. The report found that current policy to try and curb global warming is not enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists believe doing so is key to preventing catastrophe. The report found that total net greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, during the years 2010 to 2019. The rate of growth was lower than between 2000 and 2009, but average annual emissions were higher than in any decade on record. A previous IPCC report also found that wealthier countries are disproportionately responsible for more emissions than developing ones, even though developing countries are experiencing more severe climate impacts. Some of the work being done to help us better understand our planet, and what needs to happen to fix it, comes from NASA. Karen St. Germain is the head of NASA's Earth Science Division. Karen St. Germain: NASA has been observing the Earth's system for decades using that unique vantage point of space to understand how our oceans and land and atmosphere, and even the polar regions, are working as a system and how they're changing over time. And over the last 50 years, our observations of our home planet have shown that our atmosphere is warming, our oceans are warming, and that's having a lot of impact on the global system. Ever since that famous Earthrise photo during the Apollo era, NASA has been taking that same technology, that same scientific expertise, and turning it back to understand our home planet. The entire ecosystem of Earth observation has really accelerated just in the last five or six years. When we talk about how Earth's climate is changing, it might be easy to feel despair, but I really feel hopeful because I think the understanding we get from our satellite based systems, the way we see Earth as a system, gives us the information we need to make different decisions to actually manage what's ahead. So I think the science and technology can really help us manage in the future, and I think people should be hopeful about the future. For more on some of the solutions to our climate crisis, check out our April 12th episode of 5 Things, with reporter Elizabeth Weise. As for Earth Day, it's not recognized as a federal holiday in the US, but Americans around the country have observed it for 52 years, as do more than a billion people worldwide. Today, President Joe Biden will spend the day in the Pacific Northwest, announcing new legislation to protect old growth forests from wildfires and climate change. Without stimulus checks and a lapse in monthly child tax credit payments, Americans in dire financial situations are swiping credit cards more frequently than a year ago. Personal Finance and Markets reporter Elisabeth Buchwald explains. Elisabeth Buchwald: We're starting to see that people who are having trouble paying bills are actually using their credit cards at higher rates than they did last year. And it's an important to keep in mind that, last year, inflation was about three times smaller than what it is right now. So people right now are turning to credit cards because they're most likely having trouble paying these bills, and it's easier to swipe a card as opposed to taking the cash out of your account if you don't have it. Now, the danger, of course, is not paying back that credit card bill on time means that you're probably going to be racking up credit card debt. And they're going to keep tacking on interest rates that are higher and higher, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. So when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, which they said they're going to do six more times this year, they already did it once earlier this year, and each time they do that, it becomes more expensive to take on debt in all forms. So be it a mortgage, be it a loan, but credit card debt is typically the most expensive one, the interest rates on that are the highest. And they've already started to go up a bit just from the one rate hike that we saw. And the more you sit on that, the more expensive it's going to be, just because of these rate hikes that the Fed is doing. And banks and credit card companies to be competitive, they have to match that essentially. For more, head to USATODAY.com/money. New satellite images appear to show mass graves near Mariupol, Ukraine. Local officials have accused Russia of burying up to 9,000 Ukrainian civilians to hide the slaughter taking place there in recent months. Images came out just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory yesterday in the battle for Mariupol, that's despite some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters still inside a steel mill complex there. But Putin ordered to blockade it instead of storming it. Britain's defense ministry said that move is likely to free up Russian forces for other fights in Eastern Ukraine. Russia has not commented on the satellite images of graves in Mariupol. Previously when mass graves and hundreds of dead civilians were found in suburbs around Kyiv, Russian officials denied that their soldiers killed civilians, and accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. In Mariupol, limited evacuations have continued by bus this week. Some 80 people made it to the city of Zaporizhzhia yesterday, out of some 1,500 who expected to leave, according to the Red Cross. And Russian officials reportedly even pulled some people off the buses. Evacuee Yuriy Lulac described the scene back home. Taylor Wilson translating for Yuriy Lulac: ""Hell is what's happening there, it's not possible to just retell it. Russians are killing people for nothing. If the world doesn't take measures, Zaporizhzhia will be the same. Something needs to be done, as soon as possible."" At least two Russian attacks yesterday hit Zaporizhzhia, though no one was injured. Ukrainian authorities say more than 20,000 people have been killed in Mariupol, and about 100,000 people are estimated to remain with little food, water, heat, or other resources. Mariupol had a pre-war population of 430,000. After a federal judge's ruling this week removing mask mandates on planes, the largest airlines in the country say they will not require them anymore. And they add that ventilation systems on board make transmission of COVID-19 difficult. Graphics editor George Petras has more. George Petras: Aircraft ventilation systems vary somewhat by manufacturer, but they're essentially engineered the same way. Now we drew from Boeing for our explainer. The aircraft's jet engines power its ventilation system. Now, in simple terms, outside air is circulated into the aircraft where it's cleaned by HEPA filters. That's an acronym for a high-efficiency particulate air filter. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency says these filters remove at least 99.8% of dust, mold, bacteria, and airborne particles. HEPA filters also catch the particles that contain coronaviruses. Now, after being filtered, the air is pumped to overhead ceiling ducts and then downward into the cabin, where other vents near the floor siphon it out. About half of the air is discharged from the aircraft, the other half is mixed with fresh air, filtered, and recirculated inside the plane. Now, there is a catch. The aircraft's main engines must be operating to power the ventilation system. Now that means the plane must be in flight. If not in flight, commercial jets have an onboard auxiliary power unit that can be used to operate the system while the plane is on the ground. Now, fresh air can also be pumped in from an outside air compressor. Now, various medical studies say aircraft ventilation systems are highly efficient, but they still recommend that air travelers wear masks for extra protection. In comparing aircraft to buildings such as offices or stores, it really depends on the building itself. Newer buildings usually have more efficient air exchange and filtration systems. Now, building owners can upgrade their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to accommodate HEPA filters, and they can also do things like increase natural ventilation. But aircraft cabins have an advantage over office spaces because all the passengers are facing forward the same way. Passenger movement is restricted, no socializing, seat backs serve as air barriers, at least partially, the airflow is constant from the top of the cabin to the bottom, and the cabin air is filtered as we've described. You can check out a visual explainer of plane ventilation systems with a link in today's show description. A large wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona is expected to keep growing today. About 30 structures have already been destroyed, and Santa Fe National Forest officials expect a potentially widespread and catastrophic fire weather event today. The 32 square mile blaze is one of a half dozen major wildfires in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters warn that warm weather, little to no precipitation and spring winds create a dangerous recipe for wildfires. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

In an hourlong speech at Stanford University, Obama said ""people are dying"" and democracies eroding because of misinformation and disinformation on social media, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's rise and unnecessary COVID-19 deaths as prominent examples of the threat. The former president called on tech groups to find a ""north star"" and ""redesign"" themselves to focus less on ""making money and increasing partisanship"" and more on solving the information crisis he said they helped create.  “Do we allow our democracy to wither, or do we make it better?” Obama asked. “That is the choice.” Fact check:COVID-19, election misinformation dominated social media in 2021 Obama's speech is his latest in a string of talks about online disinformation, an issue he's painted as increasingly dire. Earlier this month, he discussed misinformation and disinformation in a live conversation with The Atlantic at the University of Chicago, where he described the former as information that's simply wrong and the latter as a ""systematic effort to either promote false information, to suppress true information, for the purpose of political gain, financial gain, enhancing power, suppressing others, targeting those you don’t like."" ""I think it’s entirely different from information that is inconvenient,"" he said.  In his Thursday speech, Obama said he did not realize during his presidency ""just how susceptible we had become to lies and conspiracy theories, despite having spent years being a target of disinformation myself."" He noted Putin and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon as examples of effective disinformers, adding that people don't necessarily have to believe false information for it to weaken democratic institutions. ""You just have to flood a country’s public square with enough raw sewage,"" he said. ""You just have to raise enough questions, spread enough dirt, plant enough conspiracy theorizing, that citizens no longer know what to believe."" He described much of social media as a ""constant feed of content, where useful, factual information and happy diversions flow alongside lies, conspiracy theories, junk science, quackery, racist tracts and misogynist screeds."" Wartime disinformation:Russia is turning to its old disinformation playbook in Ukraine. Is the world able to stop it? Without a solution, Obama's predictions for the future of democracy were grim: ""If we do nothing, I'm convinced the trends we're seeing will get worse."" But the former president suggested there's still much that can be done. He called on tech companies to increase transparency abouttheir algorithms and suggested they add ""circuit breakers"" that slow the virality of online posts so fact-checkers have more time to review them. He also said academics should have access to the companies' systems to improve their research and that the government should expand its regulation of tech platforms. Better regulations should start with reform of Section 230, the law that says tech companies aren't responsible for what their users post online in most cases, he suggested. ""Without some standards, the implications of this technology for our elections, for our legal system, for our democracy, for rules of evidence, for our entire social order, are frightening and profound,"" he said."

Watching the frenetic, exhausting preparation that characterizes religious Jewish households in the days before the holiday, it’s reasonable to question how the meticulous rules relate to themes of personal liberty. The biblical requirement to avoid every crumb of leavened baked goods for eight days of the festival means not only scrubbing refrigerators and stoves, but also moving any inappropriate foodstuffs out of sight. Most families also switch over to a special set of Passover dishes, reserved for the joyous spring festival and no other time. Yet all the scouring and scrambling can sometimes seem more burden than joy, leading up to the elaborate dinner on the first night of Passover. That initial feast – with its four cups of wine, four questions with elaborate answers, retelling of the Exodus story and multicourse meal usually served late at night – suggests obligation as much as liberation. Repairing America:Reparations and the fight for racial justice across the country In fact, it’s called “Seder,” which means “order” in Hebrew. According to tradition, the scrupulous completion of that order, with its 15 steps proclaimed aloud at the Seder’s beginning, clarifies the true essence of the holiday: not a free-form encouragement of each individual’s instincts and impulses, but a disciplined recreation of the deliverance from Egypt that all Jews are meant to experience every year, as if they’d been personally and communally rescued. The holiday does not commemorate freedom from obligations and rules, but the freedom to embrace new regulations commanded by God rather than pharaoh. Just as the degradation of slavery has always involved an attempt to reduce human beings to the status of domestic beasts, so the purpose of the godly rules that the liberated Hebrews ultimately received at Sinai meant to raise them to a higher level of humanity. Unfortunately, one of the most beloved of all American spirituals, a moving song that inspired runaway slaves, helped to perpetuate misunderstanding and simplification of the timeless, universal Passover message. “Go down, Moses!” that immortal hymn proclaims. “Way down in Egypt land/ Tell old pharaoh/ Let my people go!” Drum majors for change:Civil rights leaders of 1961 teach us to confront injustice These words follow a translation by the King James version of Exodus, 5:1: “And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.” More recent translations of the famous phrase “let my people go” restore the original meaning of the Hebrew and render the demand to pharaoh as “send my people out” or “send my people forth,” as in the excellent 2021 ""Koren Tanakh,"" supervised by the esteemed rabbinic scholar Jonathan Sacks. That language asks pharaoh not to release the children of Israel to follow their own wants and inclinations, but rather to dispatch them on a mission with a unifying, higher purpose: “Send My people forth so that they may hold a festival for Me in the wilderness” This connects directly with any lingering confusion over what, exactly, Passover celebrates. Ancient Jewish scholars describe the holiday as Z’man Cherutaynu, best translated as ""the season of our liberation"" because of the plural emphasis of the words. Jews stress a national deliverance, more than a personal one, in this festival season.   Sacred law and communal obligation play dominant roles in the Haggadah, the liturgical text for Seder night. The description of four sons, prototypical offspring from the wise to the wicked, honors or condemns them, based on their attitude to biblical law and ritual. “The wise son, what does he say?” the text inquires. “What are the testimonies, statutes and laws that the Lord our God has commanded you?” The wise child is specifically praised for acknowledging the distinct categories of godly rules, while recognizing them all as authentic commandments of the Almighty. Zelenskyy's path from comedy to tragedy:Can he free Ukraine from Russia? Of course, Jewish people didn’t stop composing their own, updated versions of the Haggadah 1,700 years ago. In 1969, religious reformers began promoting a controversial “Freedom Seder” to promote the civil rights movement and to condemn the Vietnam War. Other variations have focused on vegetarianism, gay rights, feminism and other causes. This difficult and disorienting year, however, seems to offer a suitable occasion to rediscover the original Passover message that has inspired the Jewish people from the time of Exodus, emphasizing law and order to a turbulent world that seems, at the moment, painfully lacking in both.

More than 300 new music releases go on sale Saturday, most of them debuting – or exclusively available at – independent record stores, as part of Record Store Day 2022. Artists with scheduled releases include Nicki Minaj, Foo Fighters, Mariah Carey, the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift, who is serving as Global Record Store Day Ambassador. Many of the limited edition releases are albums or singles never available before on vinyl, while others are being released on colored vinyl. For instance, a 50th anniversary release of ""More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies)"" from the Stones comes on two glow-in-the-dark vinyl LPs. Among the 25 tracks are 1963 debut single “Come On,” and a cover of Muddy Waters’ “I Can’t Be Satisfied,"" plus rarities previously unavailable on vinyl in the U.S. And Minaj's ""Beam Me Up Scotty,"" a 2021 reissue of her 2009 mixtape, is on psychedelic fuchsia vinyl. Janelle Monáe:Singer and actress confirms she's nonbinary: 'I am beyond the binary' Latin American Music Awards:Karol G wins artist of the year, Black Eyed Peas pay tribute to Ukraine Swift has an exclusive 7-inch single of “The Lakes,” a bonus from her album ""Folklore."" On the flip side: “The Lakes (original version),” an orchestral take on the song not previously available on vinyl. And her song ""The Man"" appears on ""Portraits of Her,"" a charitable compilation album made with shoemaker Vans to benefit We Are Moving the Needle, a nonprofit group supporting women in the recording industry. Other female artists contributing include Banks, Julia Michaels, and Asiahn. This marks the 15th anniversary of Record Store Day – the first one was held April 19, 2008 – conceived as a way to celebrate independently owned record stores and the vinyl LP format. Typically, the event is held on the third Saturday in April, often with artist appearances at some of the 1,400 independent record stores in the U.S. The last two years, there's been no official celebrations because of the coronavirus lockdown and varying local and state restrictions on shopping. Instead, the occasion was marked with a series of Record Store Day-affiliated ""drops"" of new releases. ""We didn't want to call it Record Store Day, because we didn't want to confuse anybody that to make them think we're encouraging people to go gather and drink beer and watch a band because we weren't,"" Record Store Day co-founder Carrie Colliton told USA TODAY. This year, retailers, record labels and vinyl manufacturers are facing supply chain issues, including availability of vinyl pellets, paper and even manpower to press and produce records, she says. So June 18 has been designated as a release date for records expected to miss the April 23 event. ""Let's face it, there may be some that can't even make June and then we'll look to figure out when those can come out,"" Colliton said. Digital and streaming music revenues dominate the recorded music market, which grew 23% to $15 billion in 2021, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But sales of vinyl records rose 61% to $1 billion, hitting that mark for the first time since 1986. It was also the first year since 1996 when sales of both vinyl and compact discs increased. CD sales grew 21% to $584 million, the first year-over-year increase in CD revenues since 2004, RIAA says. ""People really love vinyl now,"" Colliton said.

More than 300 new music releases go on sale Saturday, most of them debuting – or exclusively available at – independent record stores, as part of Record Store Day 2022. Artists with scheduled releases include Nicki Minaj, Foo Fighters, Mariah Carey, the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift, who is serving as Global Record Store Day Ambassador. Many of the limited edition releases are albums or singles never available before on vinyl, while others are being released on colored vinyl. For instance, a 50th anniversary release of ""More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies)"" from the Stones comes on two glow-in-the-dark vinyl LPs. Among the 25 tracks are 1963 debut single “Come On,” and a cover of Muddy Waters’ “I Can’t Be Satisfied,"" plus rarities previously unavailable on vinyl in the U.S. And Minaj's ""Beam Me Up Scotty,"" a 2021 reissue of her 2009 mixtape, is on psychedelic fuchsia vinyl. Janelle Monáe:Singer and actress confirms she's nonbinary: 'I am beyond the binary' Latin American Music Awards:Karol G wins artist of the year, Black Eyed Peas pay tribute to Ukraine Swift has an exclusive 7-inch single of “The Lakes,” a bonus from her album ""Folklore."" On the flip side: “The Lakes (original version),” an orchestral take on the song not previously available on vinyl. And her song ""The Man"" appears on ""Portraits of Her,"" a charitable compilation album made with shoemaker Vans to benefit We Are Moving the Needle, a nonprofit group supporting women in the recording industry. Other female artists contributing include Banks, Julia Michaels, and Asiahn. This marks the 15th anniversary of Record Store Day – the first one was held April 19, 2008 – conceived as a way to celebrate independently owned record stores and the vinyl LP format. Typically, the event is held on the third Saturday in April, often with artist appearances at some of the 1,400 independent record stores in the U.S. The last two years, there's been no official celebrations because of the coronavirus lockdown and varying local and state restrictions on shopping. Instead, the occasion was marked with a series of Record Store Day-affiliated ""drops"" of new releases. ""We didn't want to call it Record Store Day, because we didn't want to confuse anybody that to make them think we're encouraging people to go gather and drink beer and watch a band because we weren't,"" Record Store Day co-founder Carrie Colliton told USA TODAY. This year, retailers, record labels and vinyl manufacturers are facing supply chain issues, including availability of vinyl pellets, paper and even manpower to press and produce records, she says. So June 18 has been designated as a release date for records expected to miss the April 23 event. ""Let's face it, there may be some that can't even make June and then we'll look to figure out when those can come out,"" Colliton said. Digital and streaming music revenues dominate the recorded music market, which grew 23% to $15 billion in 2021, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. But sales of vinyl records rose 61% to $1 billion, hitting that mark for the first time since 1986. It was also the first year since 1996 when sales of both vinyl and compact discs increased. CD sales grew 21% to $584 million, the first year-over-year increase in CD revenues since 2004, RIAA says. ""People really love vinyl now,"" Colliton said.

Ukrainian President Volo… [+4246 chars]","This is a recap of the news from Saturday. For the latest in Ukraine, read more here. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin plan to visit Kyiv on Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced. Zelenskyy at a press conference on Saturday said he plans to meet with Blinken and Austin but did not share any details.  The White House declined to comment Saturday. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment. The trip would mark the highest-ranking U.S. officials to visit Ukraine since Russia launched the war. Biden said on April 14 that he was working with his foreign policy team to determine whether he should send a senior member of his administration to Ukraine in what would be a potentially dramatic show of support. A number of other Western leaders have visited Ukraine, especially after Russian forces withdrew from the region surrounding Kyiv. Blinken and Austin met last month with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov in Warsaw, Poland, on the margins of President Biden’s trip to Europe. The two also toured Ukraine’s border with Poland. During that visit, the two Biden cabinet secretaries discussed follow-ups to the March 24 NATO Summit in Brussels, and the United States’ “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of the Russian Federation’s increasingly brutal assault on Ukrainian cities and civilian population,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Blinken and Austin also pledged continued support to meet Ukraine’s humanitarian, security, and economic needs, Price said at the time. NEW PHASE OF WAR: What a new phase of war means for Ukrainians in the east USA TODAY ON TELEGRAM: Join our new Russia-Ukraine war channel Latest developments: ►The Pentagon says Austin will convene a meeting next week in Germany of defense officials and military leaders from more than 20 countries to discuss Ukraine’s immediate and long-term defense needs. ►The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that one serviceman died, 27 more went missing and 396 were rescued after a fire on the storied Russian warship Moskva last week. ►The U.N.'s human rights office said its investigators had documented at least 50 civilian deaths, including by summary execution, in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. ►More than 240 cultural heritage sites, from churches to theaters, have been damaged by Russian forces, Ukraine’s cultural ministry said Saturday.  ►At least three civilians died and seven more were injured in shelling attacks in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine on Friday, as Russian forces continue to roll into the country’s industrial east, the governor of the region said in a Telegram post. Russian forces in Ukraine tried to storm a steel plant housing soldiers and civilians in the southern city of Mariupol on Saturday while attempting to crush the last corner of resistance in a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow, Ukrainian officials said. The reported assault on the eve of Orthodox Easter came after the Kremlin claimed its military had seized all of the shattered city except for the Azovstal plant.  The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling seaside steel mill wasn’t immediately clear. Earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun. “We want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,” one woman in the video said. “You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness.” Mariupol, a part of the industrial region in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, has been a key Russian objective since the Feb. 24 invasion began and has taken on outsize importance in the war. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin. Occupying Mariupol would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere and allow Russia to create a land corridor with the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas. – Ella Lee; The Associated Press As Russia shifts its focus to eastern Ukraine in an effort to control the Donbas region, more Western countries have pledged to send artillery to support Ukraine's defense.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on international leaders to send more military aid, saying his country needs billions in assistance every month to offset economic losses since the start of Russia's invasion, and hundreds of billions to rebuild its infrastructure. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said he promised more defense weaponry is on the way to Ukraine while speaking with Zelenskyy by phone on Saturday afternoon, the latest chat between the two leaders who talk to each other regularly. The British leader told Zelenskyy that the United Kingdom is sending more weaponry including vehicles, drones and anti-tank missiles. France's President Emmanuel Macron promised anti-tank missiles and howitzers. He told French newspaper Ouest France this week that France would continue to support Ukraine as much as it can without entering into direct conflict.  Canada is pledging weapons to help Ukraine, and recently delivered four M-777 howitzers, CBC News reported Friday, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier this week he would send ""heavy artillery."" And U.S. President Joe Biden announced additional military aid for Ukraine on Thursday totaling about $800 million, matching the same amount designated last week. Zelenskyy said it was ""just what we were waiting for."" Nearly two months into the Russian-Ukraine war, the Kremlin has taken extraordinary steps to blunt an economic counteroffensive from the West. But the full impact of Western sanctions is starting to be felt in very real ways. “The government wants to paint a picture that things are not as bad as they actually are,” said Michael Alexeev, an economics professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia’s economy in its transition after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin's counter-measures have included increasing interest rates to as high as 20%, instituting capital controls and forcing Russian business to convert their profits into rubles. The value of the ruble has rebounded, but Russia's economy is still dealing with more fallout. And experts note that it could take awhile for the true impact on Russia's economy to appear. – Jeanine Santucci and Ella Lee; The Associated Press Russian empress Catherine the Great ruled a vast empire and, over the years, conquered many new lands.  She appointed her boyfriend, Grigory, to oversee one of those conquests – a place now called Ukraine. As time passed, he informed her the citizens were flourishing and happy. But, according to a version of the tale passed on for centuries, it was a lie. In the legend, Catherine planned to visit and observe the thriving, joyful subjects. Fearful his deceit would be exposed and eager to please his beloved, Grigory instructed minions to build fake villages along the riverfront – freshly painted facades.  To this day, people worldwide still refer to fake news and false fronts using his name: “Potemkin villages.”  But history and politics are a tangle of lies and intrigue, especially in Russia, so there is a twist to this tale: There were no fake villages. Researchers say Grigory’s accomplishments in Ukraine were authentic, and popular claims to the contrary are fiction – a smear spewed by Russian rivals at the time and forever seared into belief and vernacular.  “The very concept of ‘Potemkin village’ is a Potemkin village,” said Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of ""Catherine the Great & Potemkin: Power Love & Russian Empire."" While the legend may be bogus, historians believe the Crimea expedition and Potemkin’s fable remain at the heart of today’s conflict in Ukraine. Put simply, they contend, thousands have been killed and millions displaced in a war based on Putin’s misrepresentation of that history.   – Dennis Wagner After reducing Ukraine’s eastern port city of Mariupol to rubble, President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called the military campaign there a success, something he desperately needs as the war grinds into its third month. It's anything but. Russia stopped short of routing hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the strategic city’s giant steel plant. Ukraine and President Joe Biden rejected Putin’s claim of victory. “There is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen,” Biden said after announcing a new round of military aid to Ukraine, raising the total U.S. assistance to about $3.4 billion since Putin invaded Ukraine. “We're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said. What is clear is that Mariupol’s residents have endured some of the worst atrocities committed by the Russians even as Russia lost about a quarter of its combat forces in Ukraine – troops, aircraft, tanks, ships and other equipment – since the war began Feb. 24. – Maureen Groppe, Tom Vanden Brook OUTLOOK ON WAR:Putin claims a win in Mariupol. What does that mean in a war in Ukraine that Russia is losing? The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that one serviceman is dead, 27 are missing and 396 were rescued after a fire on the flagship missile cruiser Moskva last week The statement comes a week after the vessel sank. The Pentagon couldn't confirm the source of the ship's damage, but Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser with two missiles, USA TODAY previously reported.  Shortly after the incident, the ministry said the entire crew of the ship, which was presumed by the media to be about 500 people, had been rescued. The ministry did not offer an explanation for the contradicting reports. The sinking of the storied Russian warship Moskva, whose history goes back to days of the Cold War, was a blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine and symbolic defeat for Russia. – Ella Lee and The Associated Press A second mass grave was found outside the besieged port city Mariupol, its city council said Friday. The council shared a satellite photo by Planet Labs to Telegram of what it described as a mass grave in the village of Vynohradne, which is east of Mariupol. The grave is at least 45 meters by 25 meters, or about 147 feet by 82 feet, and could hold the bodies of at least 1,000 Mariupol residents, the city officials said. “We will see more and more such graves,” Mariupol mayor Vadim Boychenko said in the statement. “This is the greatest genocide in Europe since the Holocaust.” Earlier this week, satellite photos from Maxar Technologies revealed what appeared to be rows upon rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves in the town of Manhush, located to the west of Mariupol. The mayor and city council said that site may hold as many as 9,000 civilians. The discovery of mass graves has led to accusations that the Russians are trying to conceal the slaughter of civilians in the city. – Ella Lee, Jeanine Santucci and The Associated Press MASS BURIAL DISCOVERED:Russians accused of burying 9,000 civilians in mass grave near Mariupol: April 21 recap Contributing: The Associated Press"

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said he promised more defense weaponry is on the way to Ukraine while speaking with Zelenskyy by phone on Saturday afternoon, the latest chat between the two leaders who talk to each other regularly. The British leader told Zelenskyy that the United Kingdom is sending more weaponry including vehicles, drones and anti-tank missiles. France's President Emmanuel Macron promised anti-tank missiles and howitzers. He told French newspaper Ouest France this week that France would continue to support Ukraine as much as it can without entering into direct conflict.  Canada is pledging weapons to help Ukraine, and recently delivered four M-777 howitzers, CBC News reported Friday, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier this week he would send ""heavy artillery."" And U.S. President Joe Biden announced additional military aid for Ukraine on Thursday totaling about $800 million, matching the same amount designated last week. Zelenskyy said it was ""just what we were waiting for."" Nearly two months into the Russian-Ukraine war, the Kremlin has taken extraordinary steps to blunt an economic counteroffensive from the West. But the full impact of Western sanctions is starting to be felt in very real ways. “The government wants to paint a picture that things are not as bad as they actually are,” said Michael Alexeev, an economics professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia’s economy in its transition after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin's counter-measures have included increasing interest rates to as high as 20%, instituting capital controls and forcing Russian business to convert their profits into rubles. The value of the ruble has rebounded, but Russia's economy is still dealing with more fallout. And experts note that it could take awhile for the true impact on Russia's economy to appear. – Jeanine Santucci and Ella Lee; The Associated Press Russian empress Catherine the Great ruled a vast empire and, over the years, conquered many new lands.  She appointed her boyfriend, Grigory, to oversee one of those conquests – a place now called Ukraine. As time passed, he informed her the citizens were flourishing and happy. But, according to a version of the tale passed on for centuries, it was a lie. In the legend, Catherine planned to visit and observe the thriving, joyful subjects. Fearful his deceit would be exposed and eager to please his beloved, Grigory instructed minions to build fake villages along the riverfront – freshly painted facades.  To this day, people worldwide still refer to fake news and false fronts using his name: “Potemkin villages.”  But history and politics are a tangle of lies and intrigue, especially in Russia, so there is a twist to this tale: There were no fake villages. Researchers say Grigory’s accomplishments in Ukraine were authentic, and popular claims to the contrary are fiction – a smear spewed by Russian rivals at the time and forever seared into belief and vernacular.  “The very concept of ‘Potemkin village’ is a Potemkin village,” said Simon Sebag Montefiore, author of ""Catherine the Great & Potemkin: Power Love & Russian Empire."" While the legend may be bogus, historians believe the Crimea expedition and Potemkin’s fable remain at the heart of today’s conflict in Ukraine. Put simply, they contend, thousands have been killed and millions displaced in a war based on Putin’s misrepresentation of that history.   – Dennis Wagner After reducing Ukraine’s eastern port city of Mariupol to rubble, President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called the military campaign there a success, something he desperately needs as the war grinds into its third month. It's anything but. Russia stopped short of routing hundreds of Ukrainian fighters from the strategic city’s giant steel plant. Ukraine and President Joe Biden rejected Putin’s claim of victory. “There is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen,” Biden said after announcing a new round of military aid to Ukraine, raising the total U.S. assistance to about $3.4 billion since Putin invaded Ukraine. “We're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said. What is clear is that Mariupol’s residents have endured some of the worst atrocities committed by the Russians even as Russia lost about a quarter of its combat forces in Ukraine – troops, aircraft, tanks, ships and other equipment – since the war began Feb. 24. – Maureen Groppe, Tom Vanden Brook OUTLOOK ON WAR:Putin claims a win in Mariupol. What does that mean in a war in Ukraine that Russia is losing? The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that one serviceman is dead, 27 are missing and 396 were rescued after a fire on the flagship missile cruiser Moskva last week The statement comes a week after the vessel sank. The Pentagon couldn't confirm the source of the ship's damage, but Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser with two missiles, USA TODAY previously reported.  Shortly after the incident, the ministry said the entire crew of the ship, which was presumed by the media to be about 500 people, had been rescued. The ministry did not offer an explanation for the contradicting reports. The sinking of the storied Russian warship Moskva, whose history goes back to days of the Cold War, was a blow to Moscow's war effort in Ukraine and symbolic defeat for Russia. – Ella Lee and The Associated Press A second mass grave was found outside the besieged port city Mariupol, its city council said Friday. The council shared a satellite photo by Planet Labs to Telegram of what it described as a mass grave in the village of Vynohradne, which is east of Mariupol. The grave is at least 45 meters by 25 meters, or about 147 feet by 82 feet, and could hold the bodies of at least 1,000 Mariupol residents, the city officials said. “We will see more and more such graves,” Mariupol mayor Vadim Boychenko said in the statement. “This is the greatest genocide in Europe since the Holocaust.” Earlier this week, satellite photos from Maxar Technologies revealed what appeared to be rows upon rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves in the town of Manhush, located to the west of Mariupol. The mayor and city council said that site may hold as many as 9,000 civilians. The discovery of mass graves has led to accusations that the Russians are trying to conceal the slaughter of civilians in the city. – Ella Lee, Jeanine Santucci and The Associated Press MASS BURIAL DISCOVERED:Russians accused of burying 9,000 civilians in mass grave near Mariupol: April 21 recap Contributing: The Associated Press"

And it’s easy to feel powerless to fix anything. In fact, Americans were losing confidence in our government and institutions even before the pandemic. Voter turnout in 2014 was lower than at any point since World War II. A 2021 Gallup poll found that a record low of 39% of people trust the federal government to handle international problems. Perhaps most striking is that younger Americans are much less likely to say that living in a democracy is essential than previous generations. HELP UNITE AMERICA:Register to participate in America Talks But what if we told you that more than 70% of Americans agree on most solutions to the key challenges of our time? Would you be surprised? Most Americans are. In an extraordinary 2020 report, the international organization Beyond Conflict asked people to rate their views about immigration on a scale of zero (keep borders completely open) to 100 (close borders completely to migrants). The researchers also asked people to estimate how the average member of the other party would answer that question. Democrats in the study had a median score of 35, but Republicans wagered that Democrats would be at roughly a nine – a 26-point difference. Republicans had a median score of 75, but Democrats pegged Republicans at 92 – a 17-point difference. Researchers asked participants similar questions about guns and got similar results: lots of common ground, but little perception of common ground. That gap isn’t confined to our opinions on specific issues; it extends to our understanding of our fellow Americans. For example, the Beyond Conflict report also found that “Americans believe that members of the other party dehumanize, dislike, and disagree with their own party about twice as much as they actually do.” So what is it we agree on? Public Agenda’s Hidden Common Ground reports found high levels of agreement among Americans on a wide variety of issues including climate change, COVID-19, economic opportunity, racism, police reform and more. Trying to help make a difference:My dad and I went to Poland and Ukraine to help refugees, including teens just like me Perhaps even more important, why don’t we know that we agree? The first place to look is at who stands to benefit from a divided America. It’s not all cable news, but some; not all social media but some; not all politicians, but some who act as merchants of division. Whether it is to reap profits by drawing eyeballs or to retain a grip on power by dividing the many and representing the few, merchants of division have obscured the fundamental reality that Americans have a lot in common. In doing so, they undermine our power. Come together for America Talks Armed with this knowledge and a few other tools, we can take our power back. It’s easier than you think, thanks to a constellation of groups across the country that are making it easier for regular Americans to find each other and connect as humans, in all our complexity and diversity of experience. And you can find us at America Talks on Saturday and during the National Week of Conversation events that follow. America Talks is a powerful event that invites Americans of different backgrounds and beliefs to connect in small groups or one-on-one via video in order to heal divisions, solve problems, raise our voices and put ordinary people back at the center of politics. Participants can lean on a written guide to make their conversations more enjoyable and productive, and their input is later shared with members of Congress. More than 50% of participants in the most recent America Talks had never participated in an event like this. Virtually everyone said they’d like to take part in such an event again. Partisanship and faith:Religion and politics are a dangerous mix – whether it's Putin or Trump Of course, one 90-minute event is just a start. Americans need easy ways to talk about their agreements and move forward together that can fit into busy lives. That’s where organizations like ours come in. Civic Genius and YOUnify are putting Americans back in the driver’s seat of our democracy. Civic Genius provides easy-to-digest materials that break down public policy and gathers Americans from across the political spectrum in local communities to develop solutions. YOUnify provides support to organize Americans into neighborhood-based teams (or chapters) and makes it easy for them to raise their voices to decision-makers in concert with stakeholders from multiple sectors — turning those solutions into action.

Members of Congress do not receive free health care or 67 paid holidays, and their retirement plans are similar to what other federal employees receive.

That's partly false.","The claim: Vladimir Putin nationalized Russia's bank to end the Rothschilds' control, banned GMOs and created a currency to compete with the dollar
Disinformation aimed at bolstering Russian Preside… [+7405 chars]","Disinformation aimed at bolstering Russian President Vladimir Putin's image amid the invasion of Ukraine has surged online in recent weeks. Some social media users are sharing a years-old claim that Putin built key Russian institutions. ""Vladimir Putin. He ended the Rothschild's (sic) control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank,"" reads text in a Facebook post shared over four years ago. ""He banned (genetically modified organisms) and created a currency to compete against the dollar."" The post has generated more than 39,000 shares since it was published March 14, 2018, and it has recently regained traction on Facebook. Similar posts have racked up hundreds of interactions on Facebook. But the claim is off the mark, as independent fact-checking organizations have reported. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks The Russian bank was nationalized long before Putin's first term in office, the Rothschilds were never in control of Russia and Putin did not create a currency. But he did ban GMOs in the country. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment. Russia's first central bank – the main public credit institution in the country – was created a century before Putin was inaugurated as president in March 2000. Former Russian Emperor Alexander II established the institution, originally called the ""State Bank,"" in 1860 for the purpose of ""short-term commercial lending,"" according to  its official website.  Fact check: False claim that Putin rescued 35,000 imprisoned Ukrainian children The move was also an attempt to reorganize the Russian National Commercial Bank. The bank was created in 1818 to ""improve the country's credit institutions"" but did not have the ""status of central bank,"" according to the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library.  USA TODAY found no evidence the origins of the bank had anything to do with the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish banking family that has frequently been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.  Throughout the 1900s, the State Bank served many roles, including ""covering military expenditures"" during World War I and initiating foreign exchange, according to its website. It was renamed the ""Bank of Russia"" in 1992 after the Soviet Union disbanded. USA TODAY found no evidence the Rothschild family ever controlled Russia. None of the family members' names appear on a list of Russian leaders dating back to 1267. Their names also don't appear on a list of senior government officials who served in 2018, the year the Facebook post first circulated. But Rothschild & Co., the family's financial advising company, does have an office in Moscow, according to an archived version of the company's website. It has been there for close to a decade. Fact check: No evidence Putin banned Rothschild family from Russia USA TODAY previously debunked a claim that Putin banned the Rothschild family from entering Russia. Former Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich first announced the Russian government's plan to ban GMOs at an international biotechnology conference in 2015, according to Reuters. That plan came to fruition in 2016, when the State Duma passed a bill June 24 that established ""a ban on the cultivation and breeding"" of GMO plants and animals in Russia, except in cases of ""examinations and research work."" The bill also required ""importers of GMO products"" to fill out a mandatory public registration, according to TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency. The upper house of the Russian parliament approved the bill June 29, 2016, and Putin signed it into law July 4. There is no evidence Putin created a new form of currency in Russia, as the post claims. The origins of the ruble, Russia's official currency, ""can be traced back to the 13th century,"" according to Britannica. In 1704, Russian Czar Peter I initiated the ""first regular minting of the ruble in silver,"" the encyclopedia says.  Fact check: Putin's claims justifying war in Ukraine are baseless, experts say Putin first announced a plan to create a form of digital currency known as the crypto-ruble in 2017, according to Investing.com. The Financial Times reported in 2018 that Putin had ""commissioned work"" on the development of the crypto-ruble as Moscow sought to circumvent Western sanctions at the time. But USA TODAY found no reports that the digital currency was in use by 2018, when the post was published. Based on our research, we rate PARTLY FALSE the claim that Putin nationalized Russia's bank to end the Rothschilds' control, banned GMOs and created a currency to compete with the dollar.  Putin did sign a law banning GMOs, but the rest of the post's claims are wrong. Russia's central bank was established in 1860, more than a century before Putin started his first presidential term. The Rothschild family never controlled Russia. And Putin did not create a new form of currency. Thank you for supporting our journalism. You can subscribe to our print edition, ad-free app or electronic newspaper replica here.

In a rematch of the 2017 presidential election, Macron led challenger Marine Le Pen with more than 58% of the vote, according to projected results from the French news media. Le Pen conceded shortly after the announced projection. Five years ago, Macron defeated Le Pen with more than 66% of the vote.

Reporters who accompanied Austin and Blinken to Poland were barred by Pentagon and State Department officials from reporting the Kyiv visit until the two men physically left Ukraine.

FROM POTEMKIN TO PUTIN:What a centuries-old myth reveals about Russia's war against Ukraine WHAT WEAPONS ARE BEING USED IN RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE? A visual guide to key military equipment and locations Latest developments: ►The Ukrainian military said it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war. ►French President Emmanuel Macron cruised to a second term Sunday, beating back a stronger-than-expected challenge from far-right populist Marine Le Pen, who has attacked the European Union and NATO and expressed support for Russia. ►Speaking in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis lamented the ""barbarity"" of the war. “It is sad that these days, which are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, we hear the deadly noise of weapons rather than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection,"" the pope said. ""It is sad that arms are taking the place of words.” ►The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said it is ""extremely concerned"" that several mission members are being held in eastern Ukraine. The Vienna-based agency said it is using ""all available channels to facilitate their release"" but did not specify the number of people being held or who was holding them. ►Russian missile and artillery troops hit 423 targets in Ukraine overnight as part of the special military operation, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said Sunday. He said 26 Ukrainian command posts, 367 ""places of the amassment of manpower and military equipment"" and 25 gun lines were hit. A French priest is investigating alleged, ""horrific"" Russian war crimes in the southern Ukraine city of Mariupol and warns that result could show worse brutality than what was discovered in the town of Bucha. ""Every Ukrainian is now a witness to the horrific crimes of the Russian Federation,"" Father Patrick Desbois says on the website of his organization, Yahad-In Unum. ""If you have witnessed Russian troops shelling a peaceful neighborhood or destroying civilian infrastructure, your testimony will be very helpful in the investigation."" Desbois, who promises anonymity, is known for his investigations of the mass shootings in Eastern European countries – including Ukraine – occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. He told The Washington Post he believes Mariupol “will be worse than Bucha,"" where hundreds of residents were apparently massacred during Russia's assault on and occupation of the city. Desbois told the Washington Post he does not believe there is enough evidence yet to label Russian behavior as “genocide,” as President Joe Biden has said. “Sadly, it will depend on what happens next,” he told The Post. Ukrainians marked Orthodox Easter in the capital, Kyiv, on Sunday with prayers for those fighting on the front lines in the Donbas region and others trapped in cities such as Mariupol. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians not to let anger at the war overwhelm them. “All of us believe our sunrise will come soon,” he said. The Eastern Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, first proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, rather than the Gregorian calendar adopted by Catholic Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. This means the holiday typically falls later than Easter Sunday in Western Christian tradition.The deputy commander of the nationalist Azov Regiment, which has been battling separatists in the Donbas since 2014, recorded a video address chastising the Russian military for failing to observe the holy day.  ""The enemy continues to drop air bombs, ship artillery fires, guns are fired,"" Captain Sviatoslav Palamar said. The southern Ukraine city of Mariupol is ""almost wiped out,"" but a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied Sunday that Russia controls the beleaguered city. Igor Zhovkva told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that weapons delivered by the U.S. and its allies so far have been what the country needs to fight Russia, but it now also needs weapons to defend its skies. Noting NATO has declined to imposed a ""no-fly"" zone over the country, Zhovkva said Ukraine needs anti-missile systems and anti-aircraft systems ""because daily and nightly Ukraine cities are bombarded by the cruise missiles."" Zhovkva denied the Russian claim that it controls the entire city, now believed to be home to about 100,000 remaining civilians. But he said the Russians control part of it. ""Ukrainian armed forces are still in town,"" he said. ""They are concentrated now mainly on the Azovstal steel plant. And they are concentrated there together with the civilians. And many of the Ukrainian soldiers are wounded."" He criticized the U.N. secretary general's request to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, saying he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the Ukrainian government ""This is not a good idea to travel to Moscow. We do not understand his intention to travel to Moscow and to talk to President Putin."" The Austrian foreign minister's comments that Ukraine should not be offered membership in the European Union is drawing stiff criticism in the besieged nation. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said he supports closer ties between Europe and Ukraine short of full membership. One option would be allowing Ukraine to join the EU's economic zone, he said. ""We are disappointed with the statements of the Austrian Federal Foreign Minister on Ukraine's European future,""  Ukraine Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Sunday. ""We consider them strategically short-sighted and not in the interests of a united Europe."" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said they would stand behind another $800 million in aid to Ukraine unveiled by President Joe Biden last week. The aid package includes heavy artillery weapons, tactical drones and additional economic support. “If President Biden asks for more money in order to support Ukraine, either militarily or for humanitarian relief, then I will support him in that, and I believe all of the Democrats will,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told “CNN SOTU” host Dana Bash on Sunday. Republican Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also expressed enthusiasm for the aid package while speaking to Bash from Kyiv. But the Ukrainian-American said she hasn’t seen how humanitarian aid from the Biden administration has helped on the ground in Ukraine. “I haven't seen them do even humanitarian missions. Nothing is happening here. So, I think they do need more security assistance, but we also need to ask some questions,"" she said. ""What's happened with another $10 billion that we provided? Because I haven't seen it on the ground anywhere at all.” While the world mourns the battering taken by Mariuspol, 260 miles to the north the city of Kharkiv has quietly been overwhelmed by Russian artillery. The vast majority of Kharkiv's 1.4 million residents have fled. Mayor Ihor Terekhov says Russia is ""furiously bombing"" his city as shells and rockets continue to smash Kharkiv’s historic center and residential areas in the most intense assaults outside Mariuspol. Mayor Ihor Terekhov says Russia is ""furiously bombing"" his city, that an estimated 2,000 high-rise buildings have been destroyed. Oleksandr Zuiev 46, said he never believed Russian forces would target civilians – and never expected his own apartment to come under fire. ""I was wrong,"" Zuiev told the Kyiv Independent. ""It’s still hard to believe that this is happening in the 21st century."" Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Sunday that from the U.S. perspective, Russia ""has already lost"" in Ukraine, noting the many ways Russian President Vladimir Putin has not achieved his goals. ""They have intended to divide the West. They have resulted in a West and a NATO alliance that is much more united than it's ever been,"" he said. ""They thought that they would unsettle and undermine and maybe even overthrow the Ukrainian government. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is firmly entrenched in power and Ukrainian democracy continues."" Finer said Russia is more isolated in the world, its economy is weaker, and its military is ""failing at virtually every one of their initial objectives. And our objective is going to be to continue that trend."" He also would not confirm that there is evidence of a new mass grave in the embattled city of Mariupol but said such an allegation ""is wholly consistent with everything that we've seen Russia doing and it should stop."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke by phone Sunday with Turkish President Erdogan, one day before Erdogan was scheduled to meet with Putin. ""I stressed the need for immediate evacuation of civilians from Mariupol, including Azovstal, and immediate exchange of blocked troops,"" Zelenskyy said. He said the men also discussed the peace talks process, ways to guarantee security for Ukraine and global food supply issues damaged by the war. On Saturday, Turkish officials said Ankara will close Turkish airspace to Russian civilian and military flights between Russia and Syria. But Turkey, a NATO member that has good relations with Russian and Ukraine, has balked at joining the West in its strong economic sanctions against Russia. Ukraine repelled numerous Russian assaults in the Donbas last week, the British Defense Ministry reported Sunday. Russia did make some territorial gains, but Ukrainian resistance was strong ""across all axes"" and inflicted significant cost on Russian forces, the intelligence report said. ""Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,"" the report said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has steadfastly maintained that the war is going according to plan. The United States is preparing to falsely accuse the Russia of using chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear weapons, a top Russian military leader says. Chief of Russian Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection Force Igor Kirillov said the alleged plan is a reaction to Russia’s success in its ""special operation"" in Ukraine – Russia has refused to describe its invasion as a war. Western intelligence officials had warned that Russia might resort to internationally banned weaponry if its invasion continues to face setbacks.  ""In March-April of this year alone, the leadership of Western countries regularly made provocative statements about the possibility of Russia using weapons of mass destruction,"" he said. At least six people were killed, including a 3-month-old infant, in a Russian strike in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said Saturday. “The war started when this baby was 1 month old. Can you imagine what is happening?” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “They are just bastards. ... I don’t have any other words for it, just bastards.” Russia's firing of cruise missiles on the region came on the eve of Orthodox Easter.  ""Nothing sacred,"" said Andriy Yermak of the president's office on Telegram.

Follow here for the latest updates and news from Monday, April 25, as Russia's invasion continues.  United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv Sunday night, according to Ukraine's presidential adviser. The adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in an interview on Ukrainian TV late Sunday that the talks are going on “right now.” Blinken and Austin's meeting with Zelenskyy is the highest-ranking visit to Ukraine by a U.S. delegation since Russia began its invasion. According to The Associated Press, Blinken and Austin told Zelenskyy and his advisers that the United States would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition. They also said that President Joe Biden would soon announce his nominee for ambassador to Ukraine and that American diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week, AP reported. Reporters who accompanied Austin and Blinken to Poland were barred by Pentagon and State Department officials from reporting the Kyiv visit until the two men physically left Ukraine. U.S. officials cited security concerns. FROM POTEMKIN TO PUTIN:What a centuries-old myth reveals about Russia's war against Ukraine WHAT WEAPONS ARE BEING USED IN RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE? A visual guide to key military equipment and locations Latest developments: ►The Ukrainian military said it destroyed a Russian command post in Kherson, a southern city that fell to Russian forces early in the war. ►French President Emmanuel Macron cruised to a second term Sunday, beating back a stronger-than-expected challenge from far-right populist Marine Le Pen, who has attacked the European Union and NATO and expressed support for Russia. ►Speaking in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis lamented the ""barbarity"" of the war. “It is sad that these days, which are the holiest and most solemn for all Christians, we hear the deadly noise of weapons rather than the sound of bells announcing the Resurrection,"" the pope said. ""It is sad that arms are taking the place of words.” ►The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said it is ""extremely concerned"" that several mission members are being held in eastern Ukraine. The Vienna-based agency said it is using ""all available channels to facilitate their release"" but did not specify the number of people being held or who was holding them. ►Russian missile and artillery troops hit 423 targets in Ukraine overnight as part of the special military operation, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said Sunday. He said 26 Ukrainian command posts, 367 ""places of the amassment of manpower and military equipment"" and 25 gun lines were hit. A French priest is investigating alleged, ""horrific"" Russian war crimes in the southern Ukraine city of Mariupol and warns that result could show worse brutality than what was discovered in the town of Bucha. ""Every Ukrainian is now a witness to the horrific crimes of the Russian Federation,"" Father Patrick Desbois says on the website of his organization, Yahad-In Unum. ""If you have witnessed Russian troops shelling a peaceful neighborhood or destroying civilian infrastructure, your testimony will be very helpful in the investigation."" Desbois, who promises anonymity, is known for his investigations of the mass shootings in Eastern European countries – including Ukraine – occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. He told The Washington Post he believes Mariupol “will be worse than Bucha,"" where hundreds of residents were apparently massacred during Russia's assault on and occupation of the city. Desbois told the Washington Post he does not believe there is enough evidence yet to label Russian behavior as “genocide,” as President Joe Biden has said. “Sadly, it will depend on what happens next,” he told The Post. Ukrainians marked Orthodox Easter in the capital, Kyiv, on Sunday with prayers for those fighting on the front lines in the Donbas region and others trapped in cities such as Mariupol. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians not to let anger at the war overwhelm them. “All of us believe our sunrise will come soon,” he said. The Eastern Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, first proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, rather than the Gregorian calendar adopted by Catholic Pope Gregory XIII in 1582.

Fury, 33, delivered a vicious uppercut to score a sixth-round technical knockout of countryman Dillian Whyte in front of 94,000 at England’s Wembley Stadium.  And for all of Fury’s declarations that he would leave the sport following this bout, Arum knows there's no way a fighter can walk away after thriving through a moment like that.  “No, he definitely won’t retire. Of course not. Are you crazy?” Arum told USA TODAY Sports+ minutes after Fury improved to 32-0-1 with 23 knockouts in the one-sided triumph.  MORE:Tyson Fury knocks out Dillian Whyte with huge uppercut to retain WBC heavyweight crown Fury couldn’t even get out of the ring before hyping a potential next bout — a hybrid combat-sports event versus UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, who entered the Wembley ring afterward. Ngannou spoke of fighting Fury in lighter MMA-style gloves.  “I’m the boxing heavyweight champion. This is the UFC heavyweight champion. Is he in good shape? Look at the muscles on him,” Fury told the ESPN+ audience. “This is going to be one very special fight, like one never before seen in the sport. We’re not talking two light guys. It’s going to be an explosive fight when it happens.”  Ngannou responded, “I’m going to find out who is the baddest (man) on the planet. … It’s going to be a hybrid fight. MMA gloves, in the ring. Something different.”  Arum — who remained in the U.S. after showing COVID-19 symptoms recently —  spoke on the phone to Fury as the champion rejoiced in the ring.  The veteran promoter of Las Vegas-based Top Rank said he believes it's reasonable that Fury-Ngannou can happen because both Top Rank and the UFC have ESPN broadcast deals in place.  UFC President Dana White did not immediately respond to messages left by USA TODAY Sports+.  “I don’t know what (Ngannou’s) contract situation with the UFC is,"" Arum said. ""Obviously, it’d be a massive fight, and it should be easy to make."" Arum plans to arrange a dinner meeting with Fury when the WBC champion arrives in Las Vegas in two weeks.  “We’ll have plenty of time to talk everything out,” said Arum.  With three-belt heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk of Ukraine preparing to stage his rematch against England’s former world champion Anthony Joshua in July, the expectation has been Fury will meet the winner of that bout first. Fighting Ngannou, who is expected to be recovered from knee surgery around November, would follow the wildly popular 2017 boxing-UFC clash between Floyd Mayweather Jr. And Conor McGregor. That event produced more than 4 million pay-per-view buys — second only to Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao two years earlier.  Ngannou’s dominance is rooted in his stand-up prowess, so there is interest in how an attack backed by the Cameroon fighter’s heavy punches would fare against Fury's far more disciplined style.  Against Whyte, Fury relished returning to his motherland. He previously won three heavyweight belts by upsetting former champion Wladimir Klutschko in Germany in 2015, and reclaiming the WBC belt — twice stopping Deontay Wilder in America.  KLITSCHKO BROTHERS IN ARMS:Boxing greats Vitali, Wladimir in fight of their lives for Ukraine Fury briefly sat on a king’s throne during his Wembley entrance before delivering a calculated performance that simply outclassed No. 1 contender Whyte (28-3).  After shrugging off Whyte’s attempt to confuse him by turning southpaw in the first round, Fury relied on his smarts, movement and activity to deflate the challenger as Whyte averaged less than five landed punches per round.  In the fourth round, an accidental clash of heads cut Whyte at the right eyebrow. Fury’s combinations were more effective than Whyte’s intent to set up one big punch that never arrived. The fighters were scolded for roughness in the corner when Fury’s brother appeared to splash Whyte in the back with water from a plastic bottle.  “This is not ballet dancing. This is heavyweight boxing,” Fury said. “He started coming in with the elbow, the forearm, whatnot. I’m a fighting man. This is what I do for a living.”  Earlier in the sixth, Whyte let rip a big right hand that missed Fury entirely as the challenger flailed toward the ropes in front of him.  “The presence he has, how smart he is … he’s an unbelievable physical specimen, but he’s also an extraordinarily intelligent, exciting boxer,” Arum said.  Fury landed 76 punches to Whyte’s 29, and — using his tree-like, 85-inch reach — he delivered 29 jabs to Whyte’s eight.  That precision dictated the finish. Fury peppered Whyte with a jab to the face then let a right uppercut fly upward, rocking Whyte square on the chin. Fury pushed his crashing countryman backward.  Both of Whyte’s arms were sprawled behind him on the canvas before he arose before the 10 count. Referee Mark Lyson spared him further punishment, waving the bout over with one second remaining in the sixth.   “I was touching him with the jab, breaking him up with the jab and check hook. I wanted to keep going downstairs with those hooks to the body and, at the right time, I was going to bring the right hand straight through the middle,” Fury said. “I saw (Whyte) slip back. (It was) a peach. Bang on the chin. ""I knew it was over.”  Fury said he begged Lyson to stop the fight.  “It’s those times, you take one more punch, you’re disabled,” Fury said.  With Fury’s victory, Arum revealed he has the champion signed for two more bouts in America. For Fury, Saturday night was all about the crowning homecoming.  “I’m one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, and, unfortunately, for Dillian Whyte, he had to face me tonight,” Fury said. “I’m the best fighter on the planet.” "

The centrist Macron is asking voters to trust him for a second five-year term despite a presidency troubled by protests, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. A Macron victory in this vote would make him the first French president in 20 years to win a second term. The result of voting in France, a nuclear-armed nation with one of the world's biggest economies, could also impact the conflict in Ukraine, as France has played a key role in diplomatic efforts and support for sanctions against Russia. Le Pen's support in France's electorate has grown during this campaign to her highest level ever, and much will depend Sunday on how many people turn out to vote. Many of those expected to choose Macron are doing so to keep out Le Pen and ideas seen as too extreme and anti-democratic, such as her plan to ban the Muslim headscarf in public, or her ties to Russia. Conservative candidate:Marine Le Pen's far-right vision: Retooling France at home, abroad Both candidates are trying to court the 7.7 million votes of a leftist candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, defeated in the first vote. For many who voted for left-wing candidates in the first round April 10, this runoff vote presents an unpalatable choice between a nationalist in Le Pen, and a president who some feel has veered to the right during his first term. The outcome could depend on how left-wing voters make up their minds: between backing Macron or abstaining and leaving him to fend for himself against Le Pen. All opinion polls in recent days converge toward a win for the 44-year-old pro-European centrist — yet the margin over his 53-year-old nationalist rival varies broadly, from 6 to 15 percentage points, depending on the poll. Polls also forecast a possibly record-high number of people who will either cast a blank vote or not vote at all. Earlier this week, Macron took the gloves in a two-hour-45-minute debate – the last of the campaign – tearing into his far-right challenger as he seeks the votes he needs to win. First round:Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen fight for French presidency Le Pen has sought to appeal to working class voters struggling with surging prices amid the fallout of Russia's war in Ukraine -- an approach that even Macron acknowledged has found resonance in the wider public. She said bringing down the cost of living would be her priority if elected as France's first woman president, and she portrayed herself as the candidate for voters unable to make ends meet. She says that Macron's presidency has left the country deeply divided. She has repeatedly referenced the so-called yellow vest protest movement that rocked his government before the COVID-19 pandemic, with months of violent demonstrations against his economic policies that some thought hurt the poorest. France's presidential campaign has been especially challenging for voters of immigrant heritage and religious minorities. Polling suggests that much of France's Muslim population — the largest in Western Europe — voted for far left candidates in the first round, so their voice could be decisive. Macron has also touted his environmental and climate accomplishments in a bid to draw in young voters popular with far left candidates. Citizens and especially millennials voted in droves for Melenchon. Many young voters are particularly engaged with climate issues. Although Macron was associated with the slogan ""Make The Planet Great Again,"" in his first five-year term, he capitulated to angry yellow vest protesters by scrapping a tax hike on fuel prices. Macron has said his next prime minister would be placed in charge of environmental planning as France seeks to become carbon neutral by 2050. Le Pen, once considered a climate-change skeptic, wants to scrap subsidies for renewable energies. She vowed to dismantle wind farms and invest in nuclear and hydro energy."

As Ukrainians entered the ninth week of a war with Russia, the majority Orthodox Christian population there marked the holiday with prayers for those risking their lives and fearing for their safety in the country. Residents of rural villages battered by the war approached the holiday with some defiance. “We’ll celebrate Easter no matter what, no matter much horror,” said Kateryna Lazarenko, 68, in the northern village of Ivanivka outside Chernihiv, where ruined Russian tanks still littered the roads. Orthodox Easter, often referred to as ""Greek Easter,"" is celebrated by Eastern Christians to mark the resurrection of Jesus Christ and typically includes painted eggs, symbolic food traditions such as lamb and church services. Here is more about the holy day observed by millions around the globe: The Eastern Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, first proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, rather than the Gregorian calendar adopted by Catholic Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. This means the holiday typically falls later than Easter Sunday in Western Christian tradition. Orthodox Easter can sometimes fall at the same time as Western Easter, the last time being in 2017 when both celebrations occurred on April 16. But it won't happen again until 2025. Many spring religious holidays have landed on later dates than typical this year: Passover didn't begin until the evening of April 15, and Easter Sunday fell on April 17 for the first time in 62 years. Orthodox Christians in Europe, Africa and the Middle East celebrate Easter on the later date, determined by the older Julian calendar. While the holiday often falls on a different date than Easter Sunday, both Christian festivals celebrate the resurrection of Jesus, and serve as the most important date on their respective religious calendars. Greek Orthodox Easter marks the end of ""Great Lent"" a 40-day period of fasting from Clean Monday until ""Pascha,"" Easter Sunday.  Most of the world’s approximately 260 million Orthodox Christians live in Central and Eastern Europe, and an additional 15% live in sub-Saharan Africa, according to a 2015-16 Pew Research Center study. Russia, Ethiopia and Ukraine have the largest national Orthodox populations, and the country with the highest percentage of Orthodox Christians is Moldova, at 95%, according to the Pew Research Center. About 78% of Ukrainian adults were found to be Orthodox Christians through the survey, while Russian adults were about 71% Orthodox Christian. In Greek tradition, Orthodox Easter is marked by a church service followed by a large meal with family, often including roasted lamb as the main dish to represent Christ's sacrifice. Celebrants also dye hard-boiled eggs red to celebrate the blood of Christ. Slavic countries often eat Kulich, a sweet bread made to celebrate Easter and the coming of spring. It is traditionally blessed by a priest before it is eaten. Around the world this year, different countries have celebrated the holiday with varying events. In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison joined a Greek Orthodox Easter service in Sydney with Greece’s Minister for Culture, Lina Mendoni, on Saturday night, according to the Greek Reporter. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin plan to visit Kyiv on Sunday, in the highest-ranking visit to Ukraine by a U.S. delegation since Russia began its invasion. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians not to let anger at the war overwhelm them at a service in Kyiv this weekend. “All of us believe our sunrise will come soon,” he said.

In a rematch of the 2017 presidential election, Macron led Le Pen with more than 58% of the vote, according to projected results from the French news media, working with national pollsters. Le Pen conceded shortly after the announced projection. She noted that she improved her performance from five years ago and will now concentrate on legislative elections for her party. ""The game is not completely over,"" she told supporters. Five years ago, Macron defeated Le Pen with more than 66% of the vote. Macron, 44, who built his own political party to run for president in 2017, won again despite a first term beset by protests against his economic policies, the COVID-19 pandemic and, most recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine that roiled diplomatic relations across the globe. In his victory speech, Macron acknowledged that French voters had expressed ""anger"" and he must now “respond effectively.” Macron's reelection also dealt a setback to the populist movements that have upended politics across the Western world, from Brexit to the successes of Viktor Orban in Hungary and Donald Trump in the United States. “When one puts back together your project brick by brick, it’s a project that’s about getting out of the EU, even if it doesn’t explicitly say so,"" Macron told Le Pen in their last debate. American and European government officials greeted news of Macron's reelection with relief. Some analysts in the United States pointed out Macron won despite approval ratings of less than 40% – about the same as President Joe Biden, who is contemplating a reelection run of his own in 2024. ""An interesting observation, just FYI,"" tweeted White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. ""President Macron appears to have secured a double-digit victory over LePen, at a time when his approval rating is 36%. Hmmm...."" Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, pointed out that another prominent European populist – Slovenia Prime Minister Janez Jansa – faced defeat on Sunday, according to vote projections. Those losses could be ""a giant victory for the renewal of democratic values in Europe and a huge setback for populist nationalism,"" McFaul said. ""Maybe the global tide is turning?"" Others pointed out that Le Pen did better in this French election than the one five years ago, and the conservative populist movement still has to be taken seriously in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. Le Pen herself told supporters that ""more than ever I will continue my work for the French."" STATE OF THE RACE:Emmanuel Macron vs Marine Le Pen: France votes in tense presidential runoff FIRST ROUND:Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen fight for French presidency Le Pen had come within 5 percentage points of Macron in the first round of voting two weeks ago, fanning fears of an ultranationalistic turn in French politics. Le Pen has long espoused an anti-immigrant agenda, and in this campaign, she called for banning Muslim women from wearing headscarves in public. In a Friday interview on BFM television in France, Macron cast the election as a choice ""between leaving or not leaving Europe"" and ""abandoning or not abandoning the secular republic.” Le Pen, echoing the arguments of anti-globalists across the continent, said France had surrendered its sovereignty to multilateral organizations like the EU and NATO. In the runup to Sunday's election, French voters expressed anxiety over issues that have also shaped politics in the United States and elsewhere: inflation, a sluggish economy, fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, immigration and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Macron and Le Pen finished as the top two candidates from a crowded field after the first round of voting two weeks ago. In a closer-than-expected margin, Macron finished with 27.85% of the vote, and Le Pen with 23.15%. The narrow margin prompted more political activity by Macron, who had focused on his government job and did very little campaigning before that first round. Polls in recent days showed Macron expanding his lead, but the French president warned supporters not to take anything for granted. Macron has played a key role in organizing the Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, promoting military assistance to the Ukrainians and economic sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's government. Le Pen has been sympathetic to Putin and Russia, and a victory by her would have been a big propaganda victory for Putin's government. Macron played on Le Pen's ties to Russia during the campaign, telling her in one debate: “When you speak to Russia, you are speaking to your banker."" He also said her anti-Muslim policies would trigger a ""civil war"" in France. After her loss in the 2017 presidential election, Le Pen sought to soften her image. She reversed her longtime opposition to the euro, the EU's currency, and changed the national party from the ""National Front"" to ""National Rally."" LE PEN'S AGENDA:Marine Le Pen's far-right vision: Retooling France at home, abroad ATTACKS ON MACRON:French President Emmanuel Macron slapped in the face while touring small village This time around, Le Pen focused more on the economic anxiety expressed by many French voters. One of her targets: Macron's plan to raise the pension age from 62 to 65. The challenger said she wanted to ""give the French their money back.” A Le Pen victory would have meant drastic changes for the French and their relationship with the EU and NATO, organizations with close ties to the United States. France is the EU's second-largest economy and has nuclear weapons. Now Macron gets a second term for his more global agenda. Historian Simon Schama tweeted that it ""looks like those endlessly repetitive self-feeding newspaper predictions that this would be a nailbiter because France hated Macron so much and Le Pen now so reassuring were all massively mistaken."" The results of the French election are a victory for the EU, NATO and their U.S. allies, but also a warning that the populism of those like Le Pen is not dead. Le Pen got a higher vote total than five years ago, noted Benjamin Haddad, the senior director of the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council. Estimated voter turnout Sunday was less than 65%, low by French standards. ""There is discontent,"" Haddad said. ""There is anger. There is anger at the cost of living."" Macron rallied his candidacy with a strong debate showing last week, he said and seems ready to continue pursuing a ""reformist liberal agenda. ""There are things he will have to address,"" Haddad said. ""He is aware of that."""
